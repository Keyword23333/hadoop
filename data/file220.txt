2200000 it tells me i need help im basically done with the hand
2200001 i check the turn because i dont want to lose too much money if someone has j 10
2200002 with a lot of amateurs in the hand theres no guarantee that if somebody else has a 10 theyre not going to raise me and i dont know how to deal with a raise here because theres a good chance its the nuts in which case i have a tough decision to make
2200003 a guy id never played with before whod been pretty active bets 1 000
2200004 the pot was about 1 700 it gets folded to me and i call i really have no interest in check raising here because if he has j 10 im going to lose more money and if he doesnt have j 10 im either splitting or winning the pot so i call
2200005 a really good card for me if he has j 10 and a really bad card if he has q 10
2200006 im not interested in betting here id rather give him a chance to bluff
2200007 so i check he bets 1 500 i dont like it and i dont like my hand but i call and he shows the q 10 for a better straight
2200008 i couldve lost more if i decided to play the hand aggressively because hes not folding in hindsight checking and folding is a good option for me but i chose to pay it off because it was a player i hadnt seen and had been aggressive so it wasnt out of the question that he was bluffing
2200009 against a tight player who i knew i think id check and fold on the turn

2200018 i havent done anything because we havent played anyone yet
2200019 its practice so of course we go hard but the coaches want to see what you can do when the lights go on its big for rookies because you want to show that you know the defense and can play the system im looking forward to it im excited
2200020 for the older guys if youve been around the block a couple of times you know what youre going to have to do when you get out there play a couple of plays during the preseason and be healthy for the regular season
2200021 what we are doing out here live in practice is more important preseason is tough because you arent really game planning
2200022 i want to look at guys who are trying to make this team and how that second and third group plays who shines
2200023 were looking for some good backup people at linebacker we have five safeties so i think there is great competition those guys are going to play a lot especially guys like sean considine j r reed and quintin demps we have to kind of sort that out
2200024 then i think its going to be beneficial for a guy like mcdougle who i think is having a great preseason well see how he does in a game the whole preseason is big for him
2200025 you know all i can do is take care of the things that i can control
2200026 its been so long since i played a game im just looking forward to getting pressure on a quarterback again
2200027 im giving 110 percent in practice and thats what ill do in this game then the chips will fall where they may

2200033 we have also been requested to ask our citizens about their concerns regarding transport
2200034 the central nsw transport needs study is looking at the big picture for example road and rail links for passenger and freight for the next 25 years intermodal terminals like those at parkes and blayney and tourism linkages through the region
2200035 it is not about where we should put traffic lights or roundabouts so i am asking the people of the wellington local government area who are interested to give me feedback regarding this big picture stuff
2200036 you can also make submissions direct to central west study rta nsw gov au
2200037 the fact is we have to be there and make our voices heard to ensure that the federal government knows that transport infrastructure improvements are vital to this region especially the upgrade of the bells line of road

2200047 what youre going to say maybe against me but ill defend you to my death your right to say it
2200048 shall not affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict
2200049 you will see that the recognition of belligerency is an obsolete legal institution which was not even a generalized and accepted practice but rather an instrument of the policy of the usa in the southern american affairs at the turn of the 20th century i have always been amazed at the importance given to this subject by both parties referring to the grp and ndf in the philippines sadly enough the application and respect of ihl even in its fundamental principles have been made more difficult because of this unnecessary political requisite
2200050 in practice the traditional international law on recognition of insurgency and belligerency is more theoretical than real
2200051 of mere historical interest is the notion that the government of a state engaged in a conflict may recognize the insurgents as a belligerent party such a declaration was last made during the boer war 1902 recognition of the south as a belligerent in the american war of secession was only tacit
2200052 much of the case law on belligerency derives from wars of independence in south america in the 19th century in a post 1945 context this model is no longer wholly adequate
2200053 today these recognition regimes have been replaced by compulsory rules of international humanitarian law which apply when the fighting reaches certain thresholds
2200054 the agreement calls for the creation of a new state a bangsamoro juridical entity bje out of an expanded autonomous region in muslim mindanao armm that would among others have full authority to develop and exploit natural resources within its delineated territory the bje would also have its own institutions including civil service electoral financial and banking education legislation legal economic police and internal security force judicial system and correctional institutions

2200058 in february 2008 journalists jurists and human rights advocates from southeast asia europe the us and as far as latin america flew to manila to lend support for a call to end the impunity with which filipino journalists are being murdered no less than chief justice reynato puno set the tone for their meeting saying ending violence against journalists is vital to press freedom and democracy and the very future of the philippine nation what has government so far done to protect journalists or to deliver justice
2200059 impunity is not only a symptom of weakness in the rule of law
2200060 it can also indicate officialdoms apathy and where there is apathy it is a thin line that separates helplessness from complicity government must act with more resolve and sincerity to stamp out impunity and all these attacks on the philippine press

2200064 the grp panel reaffirms its position that the grp commitment to constitutional processes does not mean it will cite the grp constitution as a basis for rejecting what otherwise would be just and valid proposals fore reforms in society if it is shown in fact that certain provisions of the grp constitution hinder the attainment of genuine reforms the grp panel is willing to recommend to grp authorities amendments thereto in this context it is clear that the grps adherence to constitutional processes does not constitute the imposition of the grp constitution as framework for the peace talks
2200065 that is not to say however that the constitution is an inflexible and static document it is a living constitution with built in procedures for its amendments or revision that will bring back to the people for approval such amendments or revision to meet the needs and aspirations of the filipino people any agreement which runs counter to the provisions of the constitution or goes beyond its framework needs to go through the tedious process of amending or revising the constitution through a proposal made by a constitutional convention called by congress or a proposal made by congress by itself acting as a constituent assembly or a proposal by peoples initiative and approval or ratification of the proposal by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite conducted throughout the philippines

2200143 if you were advising a friend who was unfit and lacking energy would you tell him to diet or exercise youd probably suggest he do both right now america is literally short on energy and largely as a result in poor shape economically indeed the free nations of the west are sitting around like couch potatoes watching with bovine passivity as an unprecedented amount of wealth and the power that invariably goes with it moves from the pockets of free peoples to the coffers of saudi sheiks iranian mullahs russian apparatchiks and tin pot dictators none of whom have our interests at heart so should americans utilize the domestic oil and natural gas resources that in recent years politicians have placed off limits or should we use our technological skills to develop new alternative sources of energy most americans wiser than politicians or perhaps just less beholden to special interests say the answer is obviously both

2200171 with this summers high gas prices americans are trading in their traditional vacations for staycations vacations much closer to home but compared with other things americans might do driving is still a bargain consider for example the costs of going to a movie to take a family of four to a movie at an amc theatre it will cost anywhere from 55 75 to 71 50 depending on whether the family shares movie snacks or not and this does not even include gasoline for that same 71 50 the family could purchase enough gas for their car of decent gas mileage to drive from disneyland to las vegas and back again and for the price of tickets and extra large refreshments they could drive from disneyland to the grand canyon and back again

2200177 part of these organizations are beginning to realize that thin client computing and desktop virtualization can result in significant energy saving at the client level particularly in large scale environments smaller organizations are also taking advantage of energy management features within existing equipment as well as setting up device switch off campaigns for machines when not in use
2200178 the paperless office is still a long way into the future and until we get there the benefits of recycling paper cannot be underestimated in terms of ensuring a positive environmental outcome from a green it strategy in the office environment

2200212 that wasnt my voice was it i know ive had the song stuck in my head all day but oh dear
2200213 you go first where i can keep an eye on you

2200216 my eyes work fine you little lunatic get away from me
2200217 i can see fine you need to have your hair fixed dont you
2200218 actually i rather like my hair this way i was hoping the madam could tell me a spell to keep it from being reverted back to normal by my peers theyd be petty enough to undo their own prank if they realized i liked it i was even thinking of braiding it later
2200219 you know your hair is almost the same length now would you like braids too
2200220 sgt siler im not sure if you remember me its sgt jocelyn pierce
2200221 the one and the same i guess you do remember me then
2200222 kinda hard to forget someone who gives you an ass chewing worthy of a 4 star but as i recall i deserved it at the time never made that mistake again too
2200223 well it was a harsh lesson for anyone to learn but you learned it well enough
2200224 yep never trust the manual when it says to cut the green wire especially since the part in question is made by the lowest bidder and they used only white wires
2200225 so pierce to what do i owe your call to it sure as hell cant be to reminisce
2200226 no actually i wanted to know since youre stationed out at cheyenne if youd ever come across a one star by name of oneill
2200227 he was the co here for about a year and the second in command for eight years before that
2200228 the kind id follow into hell pierce for that matter every man and woman here would follow him into hell oneill is the kind of man you want in your corner and god help you if you manage to tick him off why the interest
2200229 hes coming in to see my boss here at the pentagon and i wanted to know whether to let him in or not
2200230 if oneills coming in to see your boss then yeah it would be a very good thing to let him in
2200231 thanks siler say if youre ever out this way look me up ill buy you a beer or two at the nco club
2200232 sounds like a good deal to me so long pierce
2200233 yes sir master sergeant jocelyn pierce you are general oneill
2200234 so they tell me i have an appointment with colonel eli mcnulty is he in
2200235 general oneill sir please have a seat and tell me how sod can help you today
2200236 i have a small problem thats right up your alley colonel and while id much rather that one of my own teams handles this unfortunately none are available
2200237 well considering all special operations go through this office and considering ive never heard of you before i just didnt know what sort of teams you might have at your disposal
2200238 mind if i get my two operations people in on this
2200239 simple no officer worth his salt does anything without consulting a good sergeant
2200240 i think im gonna like you general pierce be a dear and find lt colonel tisnewski get him in here pronto
2200241 hey sergeant when you get done here maybe you can show my own aide how to do that
2200242 how to think like an nco rather than a pencil pushing civilian geek
2200243 an hour ago one of the civilian agencies that works with area 51 apprised them of a potential problem a small amount of weapons grade material had been misplaced or at least thats what they claimed what that agency doesnt know is that this particular weapons grade material is so sensitive that all of it is tagged with a particular inert element than happens to be slightly radioactive allowing it to be tracked and monitored the missing material has been tracked to a location in southern california normally id send one of my own teams out for the missing item but none are available
2200244 not harmful to humans if thats what you mean lt colonel tisnewski
2200245 well i still havent ever heard of you but now that weve gotten the paperwork out of the way i definitely want to know who you are and where these teams are based out of dont you jt
2200246 now what in the hell does the air force need twenty two special operations teams for at norad
2200247 i guess its a good thing that people outside the mountain always assume im talking about norad but im not the command im referring to is actually located beneath norad stargate command home of the front lines in a war that spans across three galaxies
2200248 i think thats exactly what he said colonel and sir hes not laughing
2200249 if you want the official history ill ask major paul davis to come in here and give you the canned briefing im sure hes done it so many times he could probably do it in his sleep but the gist of it is while the us has been in a war on terror the sgc has been the frontline in a war since at least 1995 thats eleven years now ive seen a lot of good people die in ways that no one on earth could ever dream up of i saw one of my teams torn apart by the gravitational forces of a black hole ive seen good men and women subverted by the enemy and later commit suicide because of the guilt until you know the full truth of the sgc and our little war i wouldnt be so quick to judge colonel mcnulty
2200250 alright ill reserve judgment for now tell me why your teams arent available
2200251 well the medical team and the three science teams are no good for this situation neither are the two diplomatic teams two more teams are in the infirmary recovering from a bout of some kind of flu bug they picked up on some god forsaken unknown planet ten teams are presently involved in missions off world there are two teams each on the daedalus and the odyssey and of course the squadron teams assigned to each of those vessels
2200252 since when does the air force have aircraft carriers sir
2200253 we call them battlecruisers actually the first one the bc 303 prometheus was destroyed a few months ago in combat there was a fourth vessel but its been given to the russians in exchange
2200254 i dont like it any more than you do colonel but it was part of the agreement we reached with them a few months ago politics is all i can say and i hear that politics makes for some very strange bed fellows
2200255 but the russians why would we give an ocean going vessel to the russians
2200256 sergeant the vessels in question are space craft built in the good ole us of a
2200257 whoa he said space craft he did say space craft didnt he jt
2200258 so youre telling me that the us air force has space ships
2200259 you know people im beginning to wonder if i didnt join the right service dont get me wrong i love the army but i started out as a pilot in viet nam to think i could now be flying space ships instead of a desk
2200260 the battlecruisers are nice ships lots of firepower and shields but personally i prefer the f 302 fighters
2200261 first space ships and now fighters too next thing you tell me is that little green aliens really landed at roswell in 1947
2200262 look i can tell that this briefing isnt going as planned so how about you indulge me for a few minutes
2200263 excuse me a bit i really really hate these things but you know i think theyre a necessary evil
2200264 sir colonel emerson here we have an update on the target for you
2200265 yes sir well be over the pentagon in about thirty seconds
2200266 good lock me in and add the three others in the room with me directly to the bridge if you please
2200267 you folks might want to stand up or else my little indulgence might end up with you on your butts
2200268 sir we are presently in geo synch orbit over the pentagon and in a few minutes well be over the target site again target is moving general thats why i called
2200269 on its current heading itll be at the port of los angeles in less than a hour maybe a ship waiting for it
2200270 general oneill what in the hell is going on here where are we
2200271 ah sorry colonel but it seemed to me that you just werent in a very believing mood a few minutes ago whats going on here im getting an update on the missing weapons grade material situation where are you you are in the bridge of the usaf battlecruiser odyssey colonel paul emerson here is the ships captain and if youll just turn around well show you an impressive view
2200272 off world helping sg 1 out of another sticky situation
2200273 what is it about sg 1 that always attracts so much trouble
2200274 sure the material in question is called naquadah in a refined weapons grade state it can amplify the explosive power of a standard nuke
2200275 itll amplify a one kiloton warhead into a one megaton unit a one megaton bomb becomes well big enough to pretty much fry the northern hemisphere
2200276 i concur sir i have been going over colonel carters notes on the nature of naquadah and if a nominal kiloton device were to be detonated say over a fault line well it would change the geography of the us quite a bit at the very least it could wipe out the population centers of the west coast
2200277 yeah id say id have to agree with lt hailey on that one too i was her training officer once upon a time
2200278 general youve been there and done that on more worlds than most of us regular folks will ever dream about youve saved this planet what at least three times and how many times how youve been killed in the line of duty is it five or six
2200279 a lot more than six and all because of that rat fink of a snake baal but dont remind me it just makes me cranky
2200280 last intel i got said he was headed for tartarus to oversee the establishment of a base of operations there as a favor to president hayes no doubt
2200281 ah that would be lieutenant general george s hammond former head of the sgc and former director of homeworld security hayes named him as the director of our operations base on tartarus
2200282 i knew a george hammond when i was stationed in nam i wonder if its the same guy
2200283 the hammond i served under was a lieutenant in 1969 if the guy you knew was from texas odds are its the same one
2200284 yeah i think he said texas one time when talking about chili
2200285 yes general we have it on the scope now target has stopped looks like a traffic jam on the i 5
2200286 too many civilians around for a strike we need them to go someplace quieter
2200287 sg units 12 and 15 ive placed them into isolation whatever they have its mutating fairly rapidly
2200288 i thought it was too but corporal martinez spiked a fever a few hours ago of 106 we had to take extra ordinary measure to bring his fever down we lost him about ten minutes ago
2200289 im afraid so sir whatever this bug is its deadly general i need help on this one im out of my depth
2200290 ill do what i can anything else i need to be told about
2200291 general dad im afraid im going to lose both teams nothing ive hit this with has even slowed it down any
2200292 thank you for your report doctor im going to call the president
2200293 this is general landry i need to speak to the president
2200294 thats the reason im calling mr president a couple teams brought back something from their latest mission a new virus that we thought was the flu sir were going to need help on this one one of my men is already dead
2200295 why is it you never call with good news hank or just to shoot the breeze
2200296 i wish i was calling to do just that sir my cmo has recommended we activate wildfire
2200297 ill get them to dispatch a full team of support personnel
2200298 sir theyll need to be briefed in full at some point since the virus originated off world
2200299 well take care of it hank when will you be locking down the mountain
2200300 as soon as i hang up sir have the incoming team report to peterson well transport them here
2200301 this is general oneill on the odyssey get me general landry
2200302 trying to resolve the missing naquadah situation whats going on there hank
2200303 sg units 12 and 15 brought something back with them from their last mission
2200304 those are the two teams that came down with the flu
2200305 thats right hey i guess you do read the team status reports
2200306 i like to know where the teams are hank is it the prior flu again
2200307 they didnt report any prior activity on the world they were on just some lucian alliance troops that they got into a fire fight with
2200308 keep me in the loop make sure all off world teams know to go to the alpha site
2200309 already on that walters dialing the world for sg 1 at the moment
2200310 good ask them to head over to ktau we might need help from the asgard for this
2200311 ill get them on their way jack daedalus is due back any time now can you make sure they know whats going on
2200312 just another monday colonel have you got a plan together
2200313 we have the beginnings of one but we need to contact our chain of command to get the ball rolling
2200314 general you might play fast and loose with the regs where youre from but not sod
2200315 im not asking you to play fast and loose with the regs colonel im just saying that planetary security comes first put the mission together brief it do it then we notify the appropriate chains of command this matter is too sensitive to leave it to the chance that the thieves could get away
2200316 about wild fire yes sir sir we have a situation brewing with that missing material
2200317 weve located it its currently stuck in traffic on the i 5 near los angeles the direction theyre heading tells me that stuff is headed for the port and a ship
2200318 well sir because there were no teams available for the recovery even before the wild fire activation i went to sod at the pentagon for their help theyve got a mission put together but they want legal counsel to look it over and the secdef to sign off on it before we do anything
2200319 tell them i said to go ahead and get the material back first then notify the appropriate authorized chains of command
2200320 i would appreciate it if you could tell them yourself sir i have the commander of that section here with me colonel eli mcnulty colonel pick up the headset
2200321 thats correct colonel i take it general oneill has explained the serious nature of the missing material
2200322 and did he explain just how sensitive the information is just how classified the information is
2200323 did he mention that he had to pull a number of strings to get you and your people briefed in or maybe he neglected to mention that how about the fact that while the secdef is aware of the stargate program no one outside of the jcs are aware legal counsel sure as hell aint aware of it just do the mission then come in to the office and brief me the secdef and the jcs
2200324 not usually no but this is a matter of planetary security if that material gets into the hands of our enemies in the middle east well lets just say that the price of gasoline could hit several hundred dollars an ounce thats not going to happen on my watch am i clear colonel
2200325 well general you sure do swing a mighty big bat jt get the team ready to deploy on my authority this mission is a go
2200326 son when the president of the united states my commander in chief tells me to do something i damn well am going to do that
2200327 hes holding the line for you sir theyre at bragg
2200328 get them geared up for an immediate insertion ill see what we can do about transport
2200329 that wont be necessary tisnewski colonel emerson do you have any shuttles aboard
2200330 yes sir we can have it ready to launch in a few minutes
2200331 good tisnewski have your people in the most secured hangar they can find their transport will be there in a few minutes
2200332 what do you have that can get to fort bragg in a few minutes
2200333 standard cargo shuttle theyll have plenty of room for whatever gear they have
2200334 general sir sg 10 is standing by at peterson they were there looking over the newest academy graduating class for possible recruits
2200335 ok tell them to stand by in full gear the shuttle will pick them up on the way back from bragg
2200336 general my team knows the drill a team of unknown men could be detrimental to the mission
2200337 maybe but sg 10 knows the drill when it comes to alien technologies just because the naquadah was the only thing reported missing doesnt mean thats the only alien tech the thieves got their hands on comms tell sg 10 i want prisoners for interrogation zats first
2200338 bobby what did the colonel mean by a really fast transport
2200339 i have no idea but he said to stand by with full gear for a deployment into the la area whatever he found for us in the way of transportation will get us there in a couple hours id guess hey why are those hangar doors opening i told you guys to secure this facility
2200340 sir with colonel tisnewskis compliments sir just load up your gear and well be off
2200341 need to know sir sorry sir but i wasnt informed that youd been cleared into the loop sir
2200342 actually sir the next stop is peterson afb to pick up another team then up to odyssey for briefing before deployment
2200343 right well whatever lets get loaded and on the way then
2200344 have a seat billy i think youre going to need to be seated for this one
2200345 norad what did they spill something out there my team is gearing up for a biological emergency sir not chemical
2200346 what im about to tell you is so highly classified that it cant ever leave this room
2200347 the command in question is called the sgc stargate command the official cover for the facility and all of its personnel is deep space radar telemetry and while im sure they do that too what they really do will blow your socks off apparently the us air force has a command that routinely visits other planets
2200348 im sorry sir but did you say planets as in outer space
2200349 yep that about covers it apparently they are able to do so via something the air force calls a star gate ive no idea what that does or how they do what they do but apparently a couple teams that were recently off world brought back a very nasty case of influenza ive spoken with the base cmo a doctor carolyn lam and she informed me that while the virus shares some of the characteristics of the flu bug were currently working on it does display one particularly nasty habit and that is that it mutates every ten to twelve hours so far shes lost one patient and she reports that three more are critical from onset of symptoms to death is approximately four days i need you to take your teams and report to peterson afb as soon as humanly possible the air force will arrange a secured transport for the final leg into the mountain
2200350 per their standard protocol for cases like this the mountain has been completely closed no one in or out an exemption will be made for you and your teams and all your equipment ive no idea what they have or dont have so take everything you think you might need and maybe some of what you dont think youd ever use billy if the contagion breaks free of the isolation wards at cheyenne then we could be in for a serious situation the sgc has a protocol called wild fire for an emergency such as this if the situation becomes untenable then a self destruct will activate beneath the mountain im told that the self destruct is a pretty good sized nuke enough to fairly well level the mountain and seal the virus within that granite tomb
2200351 colonel beauchamp captain wilkerson lets get this briefing underway out latest intelligence indicates the target is headed for a spot at the port of los angeles probably for a ship bound for unknown waters your mission is to retrieve the stolen naquadah and to take as many prisoners as possible for later interrogations
2200352 our information says that one brick of weapons grade naquadah was stolen some three hours ago from a secure research facility in southern california naquadah capt wilkerson is an alien material that when combined with any sort of explosive can release a tremendous amount of explosive force
2200353 no its perfectly safe to touch with your hands but it is extremely dense and therefore extremely heavy one brick of naquadah might look like an ingot of gold in that the measurements are pretty close to one another a brick of weapons grade naquadah measures about eight inches by three and a half inches by about two inches in thickness a gold ingot can weigh around twenty seven pounds but the same amount of naquadah weighs about three times that or around eighty pounds or so
2200354 damn thats heavy so one person can lift it but its probably faster if two people carry it in a box or some such
2200355 thats right captain now as soon as the target vehicle stops well beam you down into position captain your team will be backing up sg 10 beauchamp try to take prisoners this time
2200356 ah general that last mission to the lucian alliance stronghold was not our fault they chose to commit suicide before we could detain any of them for interrogation
2200357 still i do want prisoners this time whoever is behind this theft we want to know about it we have every reason to believe at this time that the trust is involved in which case they may have some alien weapons at their disposal in fact why dont you pair off your teams one of yours with one of wilkersons from the moment you separate youll have no one to trust but your partner if this is the trust then they could have the remaining mimic devices that are unaccounted for
2200358 like the name implies captain the device can be made to mimic anyone for which they have the pattern the device is worn next to the skin and is about the size of a quarter or maybe a half dollar as far as i know the patterns the devices were loaded with when they were stolen from area 51 included mine along with general hammond and various other stargate personnel since i will be aboard the odyssey and general hammond is presently off world if you do see our duplicates feel free to shoot first
2200359 ill bet now get down to the transport room make sure youre good to go ill be on the bridge dismissed
2200360 sir target stopped for a few minutes and is now on the move again
2200361 on one of the piers sir though it might have been because of the heavy amount of traffic there what with cranes and forklifts everywhere
2200362 away could they have unloaded the cargo when they were stopped
2200363 get me an overhead image of the pier in question see if you can identify the ships and tell me where theyre headed
2200364 get on it the quicker you do it the quicker we can get this thing over with
2200365 general sir there were fourteen ships present at or near that pier when the van stopped they have all now been identified five were container ships and are now returning empty to their port of origin one was a tanker that offloaded its cargo and is returning to the oil terminal in alaska four were filled with shipments of wheat bound for ports overseas two were carrying electronic components and are returning with raw materials to their ports in japan the final two are carrying supplies for the bases in hawaii
2200366 what sort of supplies you mean for our military bases
2200367 yes sir general supplies the freighters in question make this run at least twice per week these are regularly scheduled runs their manifests show no additional passengers
2200368 both have left the port and are headed out to sea
2200369 sir first scan completed if there is naquadah aboard one of those ships we are unable to determine it for certain and heres the reason why this is the official manifest of both of those vessels both are carrying low level radioactive materials the signature of the naquadah is blending with those materials and we cant identify the ship the material is on
2200370 damn it ok comms get me the joint chiefs lets take this up a level
2200371 stand by for encryption synchronization channel locked go ahead sirs
2200372 sirs at approximately zero nine hundred hours pacific standard time this morning the director of the poseidon energy research center contacted me to thank me for my impromptu visit to their facility considering that i was in a meeting with you at that time id say it would be downright difficult for me to be in two places at once the director went on to state that major paul davis was with me at the time and since he is presently off world assisting george hammond well i found his statements curious to say the least i asked him to humor me a bit and to have someone check on the two bricks of refined naquadah we loaned to them for energy research
2200373 and one of those bricks is confirmed as missing sir naturally since the odyssey was in orbit on work ups i had them track the missing material all of the naquadah that we locate is tagged before it leaves the mountain with a slightly radioactive element that enables us to track it in any case we tracked the material moving in a van towards the port of los angeles the van stopped for less than five minutes on a pier before moving off at that time we assumed that the van had stopped for cargo traffic but now we believe that the naquadah was in fact removed from the van and loaded on to a ship that was at that pier we have since identified the ships that were present at the time out of fourteen vessels that were dockside at the time weve managed to narrow it down to one of two possibilities fortunately both are headed for the same destination unfortunately if the material in question has been mated to a bomb well the destination in question can be written off if the device explodes
2200374 thats according to the harbor master sir both ships are carrying military grade supplies for the bases in hawaii part of a regular cargo run for that company
2200375 refresh my memory jack how much naquadah are we talking about here and what kind of bang could we expect
2200376 sir the sgc loaned two eighty pound bricks of naquadah to poseidon one was taken as for the explosion well you might remember a few years ago when apophis tried to attack from orbit colonels samuels and maybourne headed up a project out at area 51 to build what they called goauld buster bombs those were mk 12s with a few grams of naquadah the mk12 went from a 12 kiloton nominal yield to well over a thousand megaton yield that was just a few grams of naquadah sir the people have their hands on eighty pounds of it
2200377 oh my god admiral benson get warning orders to pearl have them sortie every ship at anchor
2200378 sir rather than sending out all the ships and possibly alerting these people to the fact that we just might be on to them why not intercept them at sea less chance of the press getting a hold of this story
2200379 quite right general i knew we gave you that star for a reason admiral benson what assets do you have available for us in california
2200380 coronado best place they could start a mission from commander wilkes what is the current availability there
2200381 sir two mark v special operations craft and three pc 1 cyclones as of zero eight hundred
2200382 it will have to work emerson well need a shuttle to take us down to the naval station at coronado admiral benson well need a secure storage facility for the hangar
2200383 ill get right on it general how many personnel do you have for this mission general oneill
2200384 there are three seal teams home ported there need any
2200385 sir ill take whatever help i can get at this point
2200386 ill pass along warning orders to have the teams stand to
2200387 general after this is all over with id love a tour of the odyssey
2200388 hell admiral ill give that tour personally to all of the jcs if we can resolve this matter quickly and quietly
2200389 well take you up on that jack i for one would like to see where seventy percent of the sgcs budget has gone over the last few years
2200390 sir if we could operate with any less at the sgc id love to see more of these ships around with prometheus destroyed we have only daedalus and odyssey available to our forces we would have had one more but it went to the russians daedalus is pretty much on permanent runs to pegasus so that leaves the russian ship and odyssey for earth defense sir frankly we need a whole fleet of ships
2200391 i know sir but we need them if we want to stand a snowballs chance of defending earth against the ori
2200392 which is the reason we sent hammond to tartarus the facilities there plus the shipyards at erebus will mean a heck of a boost to our production capabilities
2200393 we are odyssey though we have yet to see any sort of cargo truck come near this hangar
2200394 no transport in sight ok what the hell just happened
2200395 transporter beam sir if youll move to one side well get your crates up here in a few minutes well transport you down to the sgcs embarkation room its the largest area for receiving you sir
2200396 i see well lets get a move on it then
2200397 sierra golf command odyssey we have your packages ready for delivery
2200398 packages received odyssey please be advised daedalus eta now at two hours upon their arrival you are to brief colonel caldwell on current operations then depart for alpha site to pick up sg teams then come back here
2200399 general starkey pleasure to meet you sir im hank landry commander of this facility this is my cmo doctor carolyn lam shell fill you in on the details weve assigned you and your personnel to vip quarters on level 25 ill be with you shortly but dr lam can show you and your team around
2200400 i spent some time at the cdc in infectious diseases but this particular virus is beyond my experience
2200401 for one it seems to mutate every ten to twelve hours almost like its trying to adjust to we earth humans second the first version that presented itself looked like the common cold now its something far worse the patients that have died have done so due to an overwhelming amount of congestion in their lungs its like they drowned but we have managed to micrograph a few earlier samples and were taking micrographs every four hours to chart its mutative progression
2200402 your facility has an electron microscope isnt that rather odd for an air force facility
2200403 youll find that a lot of things that shouldnt be found on an average base will be here a lot of that is thanks to my predecessor dr janet fraiser she set up the facility so that they could treat and cure almost anything down here there is too great a chance that something a team brings from off world could get out into the general population and create havoc
2200404 what happened to your predecessor the air force move her someplace did she become the personal physician to some general
2200405 sadly no she was killed in the line of duty two years ago while off world she and a medical team responded to a call for assistance from one of the sg teams while she was helping out one man an enemy soldier came up behind her and shot her she was dead before she hit the ground the enemy soldier used a staff weapon and those fire superheated blobs of plasma the plasma burned through her body vaporizing her heart and part of her lungs
2200406 im sure it is and i do hope i never have the misfortune to experience that but i daresay it would have been very quick at the very least she didnt suffer
2200407 a daughter cassandra she adopted her some years ago cassandra was born on a world called hanka a goauld by the name of nirrti killed everyone on the planet except cassandra the little girl was implanted with a bomb that would react with the material of the stargate they managed to deactivate the bomb in time but she was left with a marked amount of naquadah in her blood it gives her among other gifts the ability to sense the goauld symbiote within a person she couldnt have been more than seven at the time
2200408 any person or alien that would use a little girl like that for such a terrible purpose must be a monster
2200409 nirrti like all goauld believe it is their right to use humans like that that their natural superiority gives them that right
2200410 i hope i never have to meet one im not sure what i would do
2200411 believe me i understand the sentiment so general level 21 is the infirmary where most of my patients are currently resting the infected teams are in medical isolation rooms on this level and on 19 most of the labs are on these two levels if this virus gets out of control we also have isolation quarters on level 22
2200412 whats on level 20 i noticed you said the labs and medical rooms are on 19 and 21 why not 20
2200413 level 20 is storage areas some offices workout rooms and one of several armories
2200414 understand sir this is a frontline base sure its not like the bases in the middle east but the threat is just as real only the sfs are constantly armed if armed intruders come through the gate well id rather not have to run too far for a weapon and im sure the men and women in my infirmary will say the same thing
2200415 it usually is now then my office is on 21 the labs that you and your teams will be using are mostly on 21 but the heavier equipment like the electron microscope and the mris are on 19 one more thing sir i initially thought that the teams in question had come back with a form of influenza and i followed the protocols for a level 2 pathogen however as the disease began to mutate into a more lethal form i upgraded that to a level 4 please make sure your people are aware that this virus as near as i can tell is airborne it is very infectious and appears to be quite lethal
2200416 thank you doctor lam ill see to my teams now
2200417 attention freighter vessel attention this is the coast guard cutter tybee stand to and prepare for dhs inspection repeat stand to and prepare to receive teams for dhs inspection
2200418 were a us flagged ship if the coast guard wants to inspect us they can
2200419 doesnt matter its a freedom of navigation inspection they happen all the time
2200420 are you kidding me mr smith that cutter has at least ten knots on us even if we were empty thered be no way in hell that we could plus theyre armed and all we have are maybe a few pistols aboard look long after youve left this ship ill still have to run this route for the us government id rather still have a future after this if you dont mind
2200421 generally they come up to the bridge look over our documentation maybe theyll check out our rescue gear life boats and what not i imagine they may also want to inspect our engine room make sure were operating a clean ship that sort of thing
2200422 ive never seen them do that but it does happen now and again course that would be a search for contraband like drugs and youre not carrying drugs are you mr smith
2200423 good then you dont need to worry now you and your partners need to get below deck in your cabin coast guard inspections never look at the crew quarters and technically since youre not on our manifest youre a stowaway
2200424 chief get on the radio let our sister ship know whats going on and lets get this tub stopped
2200425 hurricane tybee target vessel is slowing we should be in range to launch a rhib in a few minutes
2200426 affirmative tybee teams from our vessels will be joining you what about the other freighter
2200427 we caught message traffic from one ship to the other apprising them of the situation no other details at this time
2200428 johnson this is smith were about to be boarded they might get the dummy device we have but under no circumstances should you allow the freighter youre on to be stopped the package must reach its destination
2200429 alright people lets do this one smartly travis otoole get your scanners out find me a target
2200430 a bit of an understatement sir this container has got to have about four dozen mk 82 bombs add those explosives to the naquadah and hell this ship could have taken out a good chunk of the fleet
2200431 naquadah doesnt explode by itself and i doubt that these bombs would have been shipped with the fuses in place
2200432 back here sir theres the naquadah looks like its surrounded by c4
2200433 damn it that would mean the other ship also has a bomb alright rather than disarming it just tag it with a beacon ill get odyssey to beam it off the ship and into space
2200434 weve got the evidence we need connors youd better request whatever back up you need i want the crew placed under arrest hold them strip them of their certifications then let them go with a stern warning its a matter of national security and i doubt they know what the real mission was
2200435 remain on station and assist the tybee as needed the coast guard will be taking the crew of this ship into custody and their ship will be impounded a container load of mk 82 bombs has been found to have been tampered with the entire load would have gone off if the container had been moved
2200436 were taking the two terrorists to another ship for immediate interrogation have monsoon stand by for departure the other freighter has a similar bomb aboard
2200437 two trust prisoners ready for transport slap a tokra memory recall device on em before the wake up
2200438 some general landry while the virus has continued to mutate we have had limited success in killing it with a combination of readily available anti virals
2200439 actually sir the killing only occurs in petri dishes a dose large enough to have an effect on the virus in the human body unfortunately also causes various organs to shut down
2200440 ok so thats not the good news tell me you have good news
2200441 not yet sir but we are working on it we need some way to accurately deliver the drugs to the virus so that they only affect the virus and not the surrounding systems
2200442 actually id like to set up a video conference if we can with colonel carter if anyone can come up with something she can or so im told
2200443 what about the two that were alive still from 15
2200444 damn ok get back to work doctors ill see what i can do to get carter here
2200445 none as yet sir they departed a few hours ago and probably wont be arriving at the alpha site for another few hours yet
2200446 damn we may not have that much time would you ask your resident asgard if he knows anything about human physiology and medical treatments
2200447 hermiod we have an official request from the sgc for you
2200448 theyre asking if you have any knowledge of human physiology or human medical treatments
2200449 of course not why would i bother to learn these things
2200450 well it was worth a try well just have to wait until odyssey returns then
2200451 not unless you know someway of delivering massive doses of a specific drug into the human body without killing said human body
2200452 right well well have to wait for carter to return on the odyssey
2200453 ya know caldwell a sight like that never gets old
2200454 i agree sir the way their ships move through space makes this hunk of tin look like a model t in comparison
2200455 well maybe more like something from the forties id think our shuttles are more like the model t
2200456 sir asgard vessel requesting communications i believe they said freyr sir
2200457 general oneill it is good to see you again i regret that thor is unavailable to offer his assistance however he directed me to come here and offer mine and i believe you already know loki and heimdall
2200458 any help at all is definitely appreciated freyr caldwell can you add the sgc to this channel
2200459 hank the asgard have arrived freyr brought loki and heimdall to help us out better get doc lam to sit in on this
2200460 we had to bring in a team from fort detrick to help us out carolyn felt like she was in over her head on this issue general bill starkey is the head of that team
2200461 neither did i before this but the jcs swear by his abilities so i have to accept that
2200462 and here they are now doctor lam i believe you already know general oneill general starkey general oneill is head of homeworld security one of our allies whom we contacted for assistance has just arrived could you explain the situation to them
2200463 doctor lam why dont you take point on this since youve been involved the longest
2200464 of course sir freyr will it be you that i am explaining this to
2200465 i will of course listen in on the information as it is passed to us however it will be heimdall and loki that will eventually assist you heimdall specializes in medicinal therapies where loki is more known for his work on your species
2200466 it is a pleasure to be working with all of you now then the virus in question is similar to those found on earth we call it an influenza virus im sending you a micrograph of the virus structure please note that there are several images in this transmission as we have discovered that this virus is mutating at a regular interval now while we have tested some of our more powerful anti viral medicines in a laboratory the dosage required can cause severe disruptions to the vital organs what we need is a method for targeting the medications directly at the virus without affecting the surrounding systems of the body
2200467 only what ive read in the reports left by my predecessor ive never worked with it directly however
2200468 but the tauri have been exposed to nanites in the past yes
2200469 good then granting you this technology will not violate any treaties already in place since you have seen nanites in the past we believe that we can use them to deliver minute amounts of the medication in question and have them directly target this virus you have identified
2200470 a few hours to design the nanite and then perhaps a day to manufacture enough to treat those among who are ill with this influenza
2200471 thats all well and good and dont get me wrong i am grateful for your assistance but is there any chance you could also help us with a vaccine in case other sg teams encounter this virus off world
2200472 our understanding is that a vaccine as you term it is a weakened form of a virus allow loki and myself to examine the protein structure of the virus and we will give you an answer shortly
2200473 we can only serve allah if we serve our fellow human beings
2200474 be our brothers keepers in practicing our different religions and not by mere rhetoric
2200475 since you cannot love allah if you do not love your neighbors
2200476 we will make the nigeria supreme council for islamic affairs more progressive and peaceful for the entire citizenry
2200477 we are yet to establish the truth if the pastor did this to a young girl who is mentally disturbed and can hardly speak
2200478 he has been rude to me and anyone who tried to take the girl from him he has always kept indoors with her who then could have defiled her
2200479 the holy spirit will guide you and you will not fail whatever you bind will be bond you will not fail it will be well with you the kingdom of god will not find you wanting
2200480 i feel great and honoured by god almighty he has done wonderfully well i have never seen a day like this in my life a day the holy ghost came down and we felt his presence
2200481 i am only asking god for his grace to do more exploit when jesus was going he said greater things you will do that charge has fallen on me now so i feel happy to be part of it
2200482 i have to listen to god whatever he asks me to do i will do already i am an evangelist an area co ordinator and zonal co ordinator i want to listen to him again to give me the go ahead on whatever he wants me to do the journey has been tough but i give god all the glory
2200483 i started as a member to become a worker in fact the journey started since 1993 after which i attended bible college for three years prayer school and school of disciples among others the only thing now is for me to keep studying the word of god
2200484 the fact that god has chosen her to become a pastor in this church is wonderful and everybody should thank god
2200485 the church should be commended that an igbo woman was elected it goes on to show the mindset of the trustees of this church that they do not discriminate against any tribe or race
2200486 the levels and causes of high maternal morbidity and mortality in the sub region review of the utilisation of health services for antenatal delivery and postnatal care services poverty and maternal morbidity and mortality men as partners in maternal health maternal morbidity with focus on obstetric fistula christian islamic and traditional perspectives on the rights of women and their role in the family the islamic christian and traditional perspectives on gender based violence and girl child education and its impact on maternal mortality reduction
2200487 such practice is illegal and repugnant to the norms of religion tradition and culture

2200509 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
2200510 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2200511 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2200512 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2200513 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2200514 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2200515 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2200516 the expert advice that we are getting is that the situation continues to improve

2200518 im a logical person and i wanted to be able to explain to these folks or anybody this is what i think it is its a bat flying around here and it casts a shadow but then why is the shadow down here from a different angle and its not in the shape of a bat
2200519 well i have watched the video and i cant debunk it
2200520 its a ghost of course its a ghost its the ghost of some former student who is really angry with his teacher and has come back to get back with the teacher and hes just making himself known at this time
2200521 get your wheelbarrows while theyre hot ladies and gentlemen right over here
2200522 once we get all of them doing that our work here will be done
2200523 weve trained ourselves not to go to the maximum in our feelings when we see terrible things like this
2200524 the war was almost declared at an end in iraq and he went out with our cameraman to cover some story and while hes approaching an american checkpoint you can hear an american soldier on the tape say stop you have to go back and then the soldier just shot at them and killed both of them ali had got married two weeks earlier
2200525 i would sit here sometimes and go out of my mind crying and sobbing i dont think insurgents did this i dont think iraqi people did this i couldnt see the video that was released not because shes my wife but because i cant bear to see anyone assassinated
2200526 they think we will be so broken so shattered by this suffering that we will do anything even give our own lives to get rid of saddam the uprising against the baath party failed in 1991 so now they are using cruder methods but they are wrong these people have been reduced to penury they live in shit and when you have no money and no food you dont worry about democracy or who your leaders are
2200527 this ruling rightly recognizes that parents have an intrinsic right to control their childrens education as well as safeguard their mental and physical well being
2200528 if people were told exactly to not leave the lane that was closing until the very point it actually did close and then we did a nice alternating merge it would be faster
2200529 another benefit would be the queue of vehicles stretching back from the construction site would be smaller
2200530 theyll try whatever they can to pass you to better enjoy the traffic jam from a few car lengths ahead of you people who feel that they have more pressing concerns and are generally more important than you will keep going and some weak spined schmuck will let them in further down slowing your progress even more this sucks im afraid its the way of the world
2200531 because i came to realize that traffic flowed faster the sooner people merged
2200532 a disturbance in which children are obsessively preoccupied with depreciation and or criticism of a parent in other words denigration that is unjustified and or exaggerated
2200533 many of these children proudly state that their decision to reject their father or mother is their own they deny any contribution from their alienating mother or father and the alienating mothers or fathers often support this vehemently in fact the alienating mothers or fathers will often state that they want the child to visit with the other parent and recognize the importance of such involvement yet such an alienating parents every act indicates otherwise
2200534 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but it is compelling evidence
2200535 the idea that anyone could say they could convict someone with what they have is stunning
2200536 they have nothing there was not a single piece of evidence produced from all those search warrants and all those affidavits he was a weird bookish nerdy kind of man but he didnt do it he was an open caring honest man with a great sense of humor who was beloved by his friends and family

2200541 had mental troubles but he always sought treatment for them he was aware of his mental state and he sought to correct it and took medication for it he never denied it
2200542 i like individual kappas enormously and love being around them i never choose an enemy but theyve been after me since the 1960s and really after me since the late 1970s at one time in my life i knew more about kkg than any non kappa that had ever lived

2200561 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2200562 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2200563 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2200564 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2200565 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all

2200572 the fact that the fed is there supporting the financial system that in itself is helping the dollar
2200573 once the housing market corrects whenever that will be and money markets improve the feds expanded role isnt expected to stick many think it will take at least a year for conditions to return to normal until then the fed still has time to bump up the buck even more
2200574 it all stems from the administrations decision to endorse torture
2200575 once the decision was made to use torture the administration needed a system of rules that would allow them to rely on evidence obtained from torture thus these military commissions
2200576 the most absurd thing is that if by some miracle hamdan had been found guilty on all counts acquittal wouldnt have meant liberty hed have just been moved to a different cell the trial was essentially meaningless because the administration takes the position that it has the right to hold enemy combatants until the end of the war on terror whether or not they have been convicted of crimes
2200577 artificial intelligence to extend and improve the existing monitoring system
2200578 we aim to achieve all day and all weather monitoring capability
2200579 the national organic standards call for the administrator of ams usda agricultural marketing service to appoint members of a peer review panel to evaluate the nop s adherence to its accreditation procedures and its accreditation decisions
2200580 inspectors will be providing information and advice on workplace rights and obligations under nsw industrial laws including child employment laws and information to assist retailers suppliers and contractors in complying with the ethical clothing trades scheme
2200581 the most common breaches detected by inspectors during these visits include the underpayment of staff not displaying the appropriate award not supplying pay slips to employees and not keeping proper time and wage records
2200582 most employers want to do the right thing however employers who ignore minimum legal standards will be prosecuted and can face fines up to 11 000 for each offence
2200583 these visits ensure an equitable system for all employers and workers by maintaining fair and productive workplaces in nsw
2200584 in 2008 09 nsw inspectors plan to visit 13 000 workplaces across the state to ensure that businesses are competing fairly and complying with their obligations as an employer
2200585 i am definitely buying a lottery ticket and i am going for five eights
2200586 i might win millions but then again i might not
2200587 i would actually like to be turning eight not 88 but i could be worse off at my age
2200588 we will be prioritising high visibility policing this weekend in and around licensed premises and alcohol free and prohibited zones
2200589 i stress that it is important that inverell residents who do decide to drink on this weekend do so responsibly and have pre organised a safe way to get home
2200590 we are grateful for support from local police and inverell shire council in helping us increase safety at this high risk time as the security and enjoyment of our patrons is always a priority for us
2200591 i was the only passenger who just stayed in armidale for the day the others caught the train
2200592 but as time goes on i am sure more people will use this service just to spend the day in the town
2200593 there is also a connection from the armidale bus service to get into town which is great
2200594 people can go into town to the university to the hospital and various other places they made need to go
2200595 this means that inverell passengers leave a little earlier than present and arrive home a little later
2200596 nevertheless we are confident the benefits of making the transfer between coach and train at armidale instead of tamworth will outweigh the slightly longer overall journey time
2200597 it means they can enjoy a breakfast snack on the train and those coming back can have an evening meal
2200598 on the old service passengers would have been sitting on the bus with no refreshments
2200599 not only do the passengers from inverell and intervening centres get a more desirable service but the patronage figures for the train into and out of armidale will also benefit
2200600 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
2200601 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2200602 notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear
2200603 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies
2200604 why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
2200605 each year motor vehicle crashes cost our community dearly at every level financially and emotionally through co ordinated campaigns such as this real outcomes can be achieved to reduce the occurrence of motor vehicle crashes in this region
2200606 therefore it is vital that as a community we provide care and support to those that care and support people with a mental illness
2200607 i think i have something to offer im concerned about youth issues in the community and i feel i offer a different perspective
2200608 ive been frustrated for the past four years and its time to go back
2200609 i think i have a lot to offer the community i have a strong interest in social issues and i believe i can make a difference
2200610 we need development but we need to grow in the right ways we need to grow like yass
2200611 im very protective of farming and farmers rights and making sure we get the right balance between development existing farmers and people living in the town and villages
2200612 murrumbateman is growing rapidly and is now large enough to elect at least two councillors
2200613 i believe you have to live here and be a part of the community to have your finger on the pulse and access to the issues
2200614 it is really important that a diversity of citizens with a diversity of views run for election and from that we will get a good strong council
2200615 im very keen to see young people stand and people from a rural background
2200616 four farming families were approached by epuron to put wind farms on properties but ive been told some of them are no longer interested
2200617 there is no support for them in our district except for the four original families some of which have backed away
2200618 it will certainly split the community if they are built it will be a very sad thing and it will cause a lot of grief and ill will in the area
2200619 the issue has already caused disunity among family and friends and people who have known each other for years
2200620 origin purchased the rights to develop conroys gap but has not acted on those rights and has no plans to develop in the short term
2200621 some of these farmers are on their knees and they have been offered a financial way out but they have only been told half the story
2200622 if the wind is too strong they turn off and if the wind is too weak they dont turn on its all about making money
2200623 i fervently believe the smaller wind farms are being built for carbon credits and not for making power
2200624 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2200625 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive
2200626 six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 kilometres an hour
2200627 i heard a terrible noise i immediately left my office to see what had happened the image before me will never leave me until the day i die
2200628 it is not easy to speak when you have a catastrophe of such proportions before your eyes
2200629 the czech government will examine this catastrophe on august 20
2200630 if there had been the slightest suspicion of complications for example cranial head trauma then they would certainly have been kept in
2200631 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2200632 i see the votes every week and i knew what joshua was getting so i wasnt surprised
2200633 maybe it will next week when all this craziness has gone away
2200634 you always hope its you but i knew a lot of people loved twitch
2200635 i wasnt surprised i was just so overwhelmed with emotion and exhausted in that moment
2200636 the first 3 d dance movie step it up 3 d
2200637 w e spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2200638 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious web sites from anywhere on facebook less than 002 of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2200639 a review of records from whole foods indicates that some of the stores received product from the recall list
2200640 at this time it is not known why the food listed under the usda recall was sold to the public after the recall date
2200641 the menu should be as informative of what its effect is on ones waistline as it is on their pocketbooks
2200642 not ingesting 800 calories in a meal makes a huge difference to ones health and quality of life
2200643 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
2200644 they allow researchers to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong
2200645 i think well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative diseases
2200646 we dont even know when a patient gets diabetes if each patient gets it the same way
2200647 it allows us to test various theories about how the universe is
2200648 by looking for new type of particles that have yet to be discovered one may hope to get insight into whether some of the very interesting ideas in particle physics are correct or not
2200649 models that attempt to unify gravity with the other forces often make predictions that there should be other particles present in the universe that have yet to be discovered if we can go out and discover those particles that are predicted but have yet to be found that could powerfully give us an indication were on the right track or alternatively tell us no were on the wrong track and we should look somewhere else
2200650 theyre looking down deeper and deeper into what may be the most fundamental particles of the universe
2200651 we know were not there yet we know protons are made up of other small things the idea is to find out about those small things
2200652 the debris of those collisions only lasts for a very short amount of time so they have to have extremely sophisticated detectors to take a look at these things a fraction of a fraction of a second
2200653 so i turned up in happy disney mode and everyone was on this almighty fucking downer
2200654 and then i flew back feeling down and everyone else was up
2200655 the way england reacted to neighbours was such a surprise to me i couldnt walk down the street without people screaming so that allowed me to take england off its pedestal and see it for what it is
2200656 i suppose that houdini might as well have been called joe smith in that hes just used as the tool to help gillian delve into what she wants to get into which is love
2200657 funnily enough i came into this film after playing andy warhol in factory girl where i was really struggling to get everyone to keep the facts straight throwing history books down in front of everyone
2200658 they say ah you must be so disappointed you havent had russells career but that just shows the external perception of what they think every actor wants that if you want to be an actor you must want to be tom cruise but ive always struggled with the idea of fame and recognition yes i want a certain amount of attention but i dont need a whole lot of money and i dont need to be throwing phones at people and ending up in the press doing crazy things every week because you know that brings attention to yourself and if you dont want that kind of attention dont do it
2200659 heres a guy who does big hollywood films but theyre solid credible films and he does good work in them
2200660 well if theres a good studio film theyre going to offer it to johnny depp theyre not going to offer it to me
2200661 and if its a bad studio film that johnny depp is not going to do theyll offer it to me and if its bad im not going to want to do it anyway so the problem sort of takes care of itself
2200662 then there are the ones that ride the line where you think ooh is it good
2200663 i dont want that experience and ive never wanted that experience
2200664 and i suppose that for me it would be that i suffer from a lot of social anxiety i was a really anxious kid a real loner
2200665 and i still have trouble in some social situations im very aware of space taker uppers those people who are always demanding attention they make me very uncomfortable so maybe thats why ive arranged my life the way i have why ive never moved to la or wanted that endless barrage of attention
2200666 but im a lot better than i used to be
2200667 camera technologies can benefit directly from these advances we believe more generally that many new application possibilities will emerge from the ability to integrate optoelectronic devices onto curved surfaces bring electronics to the human body in the form of advanced biomedical devices is one broad area of possible application
2200668 we would like to explore the ability of these types of approaches for implantation into the human eye for people who suffer from degeneration of the retina many other problems mainly in the area of biocompatibility and bio interfaces would need to be solved first however
2200669 the novelty is that we are able to conform convention 2 d planar optoelectronics technologies onto curvilinear surfaces such as those of a hemisphere this type of capability can open up new design avenues for advanced camera systems in which not only the lenses but also the geometrical layouts of the detector arrays can be optimized for performance
2200670 the devices that we were able to achieve involve the detector arrays conformally integrated with a hemispherical surface with the size geometry and overall layout of the human eye the imaging characteristics of these devices are better than those possible with planar layouts when simple single component optics are used
2200671 i offer you my sincere apologies and my assurances that we are taking all action possible to mitigate the consequences of this regrettable incidence
2200672 theres absolutely no evidence this data has been misused and the measures we took were entirely precautionary
2200673 whilst the independent company was responsible for this issue we took it seriously
2200674 cbbc suspended new commissions and work on new programming until a full review of objectives practices took place
2200675 work only recommenced when we were satisfied that procedures were as strong as possible
2200676 apple has approved our iphone app and we will be making it available in about a week in the app store

2200680 one of the worst run companies that i have ever come in contact with
2200681 i get pleasure from playing especially at night people will walk and hold hands they seem happy some people dance some people sing along some people like it enough to give me something most people give change once in a while theyll give me a dollar or a five dollar bill
2200682 aaron was really rewriting the book on the capacity of the tuba
2200683 when he played you didnt feel like he had valves you felt that he was expressing something
2200684 when i went to different countries and different states id play and take a solo
2200685 the whole audience would stand up and clap how do you think that felt
2200686 you have to have a lot of respect for a person who loves what they do that much
2200687 it is the one thing that has kept him alive
2200688 he wakes up and thats what hes looking forward to his music
2200689 he was such a nice guy when i was coming up he can come out and play with us any time
2200690 im so in love its unreal we got engaged this weekend
2200691 slippers nail care products dog apparel calenders then time to wine can make it we just have to

2200693 yes ive tightened up my budget to meet increasing prices
2200694 yes ive tightened up my budget to put emergency money aside
2200695 yes i believe it is a necessary institution and one that i will participate in to help preserve
2200696 no i dont believe in it strongly but ill probably end up getting married anyway
2200697 yes i believe in it as an institution but its not for me
2200698 yes it is a good test to put the relationship through before marriage
2200699 no a man should enjoy his freedom while he can
2200700 no i might be tempted but i love and respect her too much
2200701 no i might be tempted but cheating violates my morals
2200702 yes she cant be hurt if she doesnt know about it
2200703 the legal definition of a crime against humanity is a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population
2200704 we believe members of mugabes inner circle who turned ruling party youth militia into rapists and killers are responsible for crimes against humanity
2200705 if you dont tell the youth militia where the suspected opposition members are they insert pesticides in your vagina
2200706 a lot of them had sticks inserted into their vagina pushed in there in order for you to tell them i will never never support the opposition
2200707 im talking about an old granny whom i saw in the morning with the power to look after her grandchildren but in the evening shes in the bush with the semen dribbling from 18 men
2200708 we are coming again until you give birth to a zanu pf child
2200709 i dont want to cause trouble for myself i dont have a choice but to turn you away
2200710 they are co perpetrators and accomplices in crimes against humanity
2200711 to record the names of the perpetrators we want to take the statements of the witnesses while the memories are still fresh we dont want to allow a culture of denial or legal erasure
2200712 its dark at times and complex but its also very very funny
2200713 my character has given me a great deal of pleasure to play because shes so well written i suspect she was a tremendous flirt during the war years and had loads of affairs but has now settled down and loves shopping and sitting in front of the television
2200714 i suppose you would call her eccentric but shes not barking mad shes very funny and witty but yes shes also a very difficult woman
2200715 though it really could be any town anywhere in this country
2200716 i suppose im reasonably feisty and i loathe injustice so yes theres a part of me which is like all the parts ive ever played but then there are plenty i hope that im nothing like at all
2200717 well ive probably grown into a rather grumpy old woman myself
2200718 i suppose im reasonably feisty and i loathe injustice so yes theres a part of me which is like all the parts ive ever played but then there are plenty i hope that im nothing like at all
2200719 friendships were forged on that set and im in touch with many of the cast today we had a wonderful time and were very proud of our work because it was groundbreaking in many ways
2200720 ill only retire when the brain or the legs go
2200721 right now im enjoying choosing my roles and i hope i can continue working for a long time yet
2200722 it has come as absolute news to me i obviously knew nothing about it whatsoever
2200723 i better slow down so i can move into the right lane to exit
2200724 coup as petit likes to call it required months of preparation petit had already done high wire stunts at notre dame cathedral and the sydney harbor bridge when he began to plan how he and several accomplices would enter the wtc petit was arrested immediately after the stunt
2200725 my purpose in life is to use my lifes experiences and beliefs to help my kids and their kids to become contributing happy 31
2200726 rather than tolerate russias nuclear blackmail or cyber attacks western nations should make clear that the solidarity of nato from the baltic to the black sea is indivisible
2200727 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2200728 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia

2200737 i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe
2200738 i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe
2200739 test i wasnt surprised to see the results at least i am not a pessimist anymore
2200740 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2200741 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2200742 supremacists who is more dangerous to the heart of america who uses a
2200743 saving the flower of white womanhood what kind of limp wristed goofiness is that please dont hide behind women or use them aug 8th 2008
2200744 ive never understood what makes a guy like david duke tick sure being white is cool you can always get a cab shoplift with impunity and people are really impressed when you can dance but i dont get the need to be supreme what is it that makes duke so insecure so threatened
2200745 as i reported in june white supremacists have already reaped the benefits of obamas nomination for president an obama win in november will likely continue that trend
2200746 what is it about you tommy that makes you so insecure so threatened
2200747 knowingly or who should have reasonably known they were enabling illegal activities
2200748 un american wages of less than a minimum living wage
2200749 any person can become wealthy if only the government would stay out of their way
2200750 obama is a strategist less a tactician he doesnt easily get ruffled with the daily events this is good because it makes a great leader maybe a great politician
2200751 he was hired for that assignment and there are no more assignments scheduled
2200752 this guy was a credentialed member of the press he has every right to his freedom of speech
2200753 who are you and what have you done with the democrats
2200754 mr keating his associates and his friends contributed 56 000 for
2200755 f rom 1984 to 1987 senator mccain took actions on mr keatings
2200756 based on the evidence available to it the committee has given
2200757 the committee reaffirms its prior decision that it does not have
2200758 the silent majority for those of you to young to remember this google it
2200759 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2200760 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect
2200761 but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
2200762 keep your tires inflated and we can save as much oil that offshore drilling could produce
2200763 also factor in the silent majority and i see obama as a big loser in nov aug 8th 2008
2200764 they try and tell you he doesnt look like the guys on the dollar bill
2200765 people in old age are fully capable of imaginative and skillful work

2200768 ranch ala bush and sucking up some of his wifes budweisers

2200771 f rom 1984 to 1987 senator mccain took actions on mr keatings
2200772 based on the evidence available to it the committee has given
2200773 the committee reaffirms its prior decision that it does not have
2200774 but cash rich obama has yet to cough up the dough from his backers
2200775 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2200776 reportedly hillary seriously doubts that obama can beat mccain come november and she is thinking of keeping her name in nomination and demand a vote at the partys denver convention
2200777 today the end of the current financial crisis looks further away than it did in august 2007 policy is not yet ahead of the curve i used to remark in the context of the emerging market crises of the 1990s that i would date the moment of recovery from the first time an official pronouncement proved to be too pessimistic by this standard recovery is not at hand the best prospects for managing a very difficult situation involve a comprehensive effort to support the real economy through temporary fiscal stimulus and the financial system through a program of measures directed at capital rather than liquidity problems these steps offer no assurance of success but reactive drift raises the risks of costly failure
2200778 the dollar is still overvalued but solely with respect to a number of asian currencies plus the swiss franc and swedish krona not with respect to the euro pound sterling canadian dollar etc indeed the latter have overshot with respect to the dollar but not greatly so most of their overvaluation would be corrected by an appreciation of the asian currencies the largest undervaluations are those of singapore and switzerland even though they were assigned larger current balance targets than the norm the largest overvaluations are those of south africa and turkey the polish zloty and not shown hungarian forint were also found to be overvalued the two u s neighbors canada and mexico both appear roughly correct at present canada and australia are both close to parity with the u s dollar reflecting the strength of energy and raw material prices the effective changes of the asian currencies would be far smaller than their bilateral changes vis vis the dollar reflecting the importance of asian intra trade
2200779 theres an important philosophical difference between the first stimulus which was overwhelmingly bipartisan and current congressional attempts to increase government spending
2200780 better someone else be in charge of bailouts he argues than the federal reserve which he led for 18 years mr greenspan says a high level panel of american financial officials should be given broad power to seize any financial institution whose failure threatens the entire economy bail out its creditors and close it down we need laws that specify and limit the conditions for bailouts and do so transparently with taxpayers money rather than circuitously through the central bank as was done during the blow up of bear stearns he writes
2200781 the power of europes unions its history of hyperinflation and the need to develop credibility for a young institution all justify the ecbs tough stance because the fed does not have these problems but faces a potentially serious recession it is prepared to gamble that the weakness in us employment and the general decline in economic activity will prevent a wage price spiral without further increases in the interest rate if food and energy prices remain at todays level and wage costs do not accelerate the overall consumer price index inflation will decline by next year to an annual rate of less than 3 per cent i think the feds current interest rate strategy makes sense but would be too risky for the ecb
2200782 blijf maar bij dat scorebord staan nu gaan we door
2200783 als dit al beheerst is moet je indenken hoe het klinkt als we enthousiast zijn
2200784 ik wil wel graag mijn eigen shirtje mee naar huis

2200787 vorige keer hebben we nog zon heerlijke pot voetbal tegen jullie gespeeld
2200788 frank marshall davis was acknowledged by obama as perhaps the most significant mentor in obamas adolescent years
2200789 the obama davis connection is a ticking time bomb for the democratic party aug 8th 2008 democratic campaign playbook for obama attention all obama boy supporters there will be times when you encounter those who would choose to reveal information about me that knocks me off my pedestal there is some vinegar in the kool aid i tell you but pay no attention never fear help is near here are the recommended responses to such blasphemy 1 you are a racist of course the only reason someone would not love me is because im black play the race card often 2 you are a liar of course there is no foundation for any negative remarks about me the millions who do not see my brilliance are of course liars we have taken care of the bad stuff on google 3 you hate obama what other reason could there be that there are millions who will vote hillary or mccain 4 you are ill informed perhaps they dont buy the garbage i give you on my web site the only source for obama information do not look elsewhere 5 if none of the above work s t u p i d idiot moron are words that should be used often when you are desperately unable to defend me 6 if all else fails and if they continue to call me a rookie ultra liberal black radical white hating terrorist loving liar and a corrupt pawn of the chicago political machine you can always pass it off that they are republican plants keep the kool aid alive even if it is filled with vinegar aug 8th 2008 if you let that arrogant millionaire persuade your vote then politics as usual with no changes to speak of mccain is a damned liar and is very stupid when it comes to real policies mcliar plays on uncertainties i have promised myself for over the last 20 years to try to get mccain out of this great countries leadership he is not for anyone other than himself and the other wealthy people all he cares about is your vote i will most certainly vote for mr obama not john mcliar jc a matter of experience or lack thereof has been a major area of focus and debate in conjunction with the current presidential campaign it has been mentioned many times that experience matters much more than having just a vision for change then there are those that contend that the experience does not matter and that all you need is a vision in line with the matter of experience i would like to ask the following has there been a major corporation wherein a junior executive with less than four years on the job has become the ceo of that corporation has there been a reputable law firm wherein a junior lawyer with less than four years on the job has become a full partner or was assigned a major case for that firm has there been a police department or fire department wherein a rookie officer firefighter with less than four years on the job has become the chief of police or the fire captain has there been a major media outlet such as a newspaper magazine or news outlet such as cnn where a junior reporter with less than four years on the job has become the editor in chief or an anchor for the news the list could run on the major point here is that in each and every case experience does matter across all aspects of our society it has been proven that those with the experience on the job are those that have earned the right to move up into a position of leadership therefore it is also true with decidedly the most important leadership job in our country if not the world to be the president of the united states requires experience having a vision for change is a good thing not having the proven experience to see that vision carried out is quite another with the current state of our nation the job of our next president will be one of the toughest in history the rising deficit our declining economy and jobs market the meltdown in both the financial and housing markets global warming and its potential impacts the immigration crisis and the war in iraq and afghanistan are just some of the critical challenges that our next president must address it is going to take much more than just a vision to take on the issues facing our nation and its people it is going to take experience a lot of experience i urge that the people of america consider this fact as they continue with the process of choosing who is to sit in the oval office come next january as i have stated vision is a good thing it has been at the heart and soul of our nation since the founding it took great vision to challenge the powers of the time and give birth to the oldest democracy on our planet however without proven experience the vision would have been lost aug 8th 2008 david knowless is a typical liberal moron who calles everyone stupid when they dont agree with his concepts or follow his dictates whatever his problem is trust yourselves and do what is right for you in the sum total of all of us regardless of our collective or individual stupidity there is genius in our simple participation in the democratic process knowless is an idiot during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points

2200804 for the subprime mortgage crisis our analysis suggests that policies that aim primarily at restoring consumer confidence and increasing demand such as a tax rebate to households will probably be insufficient to help the real economy
2200805 policies that could relax liquidity constraints faced by non financial firms are likely to be indispensable
2200806 refers to difficulties in raising external finance of all kinds not merely in borrowing from banks
2200807 a tightened liquidity squeeze appears to be economically more important than reduced consumer confidence or spending in explaining cross firm differences in stock price declines

2200819 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
2200820 theres a concern that three month taf could be too small
2200821 we suspect the fed might increase taf eventually but it might take a while

2200828 the decline in the teenage pregnancy rate can be attributed to abstinence and abstinence education programs an april 2003 study in adolescent family and health found that 67 percent of the decrease in teen pregnancy rate among women between the ages of 15 and 19 can be attributed to abstinence
2200829 in 2005 the wisconsin state legislature passed a bill that requires all public schools that teach human growth and development to stress abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity and that abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases

2200845 i avoid using the term mutilation because thats not the way my patients feel
2200846 do you smoke do you drink have you been circumcised
2200847 this tradition is perpetuated primarily by the women men dont get involved in the circumcision ritual they see it as womans business
2200848 the majority of my patients dont have post traumatic syndrome disorder those who have it it is because they came from a war zone area not because they underwent fgc

2200852 parents are not trying to kill their kids but to make sure their daughter will have a clean and healthy life they are trying to protect them

2200856 the future of our economy depends on investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power we already know that hundreds of thousands of americans work in jobs that could contribute to a green economy failing to extend these tax credits would be a missed opportunity to simultaneously create jobs and make our country more energy independent while at the same time doing our part to improve the environment for our kids and our grandkids
2200857 this agreement presents an excellent opportunity for emission reductions the greenhouse gas reductions 50 percent are particularly significant
2200858 the limestone expansion is part of our program to invest in texas with a balanced portfolio of nuclear gas wind and coal

2200864 half the utilities on the trip really had done nothing or little solar installation it was a complete eye opener for them
2200865 its plug in and play literally you buy a solar panel and put it on your roof drop down two wires and call the electric utility its an order of magnitude faster than where we are today
2200866 every single utility would decrease the time they said it would be before solar would be a significant part of their utility mix
2200867 i really enjoyed this week hearing about the fibonacci series for a long time i didnt understand how it related to what we were doing in class but then maria explained it and all of a sudden it clicked into place for me it was really neat although i didnt participate in class much this week because of some other problems in my life right now i still felt as though i learned a lot
2200868 sorry to hear about your life problems but im glad the math made sense to you checkmark
2200869 this is the problem with education in america today were too wrapped up in how the student is reacting to the classroom rather than in whether or not theyve learned the damn concepts
2200870 this is clearly a math class for students who dont have a good background in math a lot of the reflections have mentioned learning about simple probability like drawing a red card or an ace from a deck and these students have maybe always been afraid of math because of their weakness in it this provides an opportunity for the prof to find out what works and what doesnt in her teaching style as well as to find out which students need more help
2200871 but wouldnt both the student and prof time spent on these reflections be better spent i dont know doing math problems reinforcing concepts
2200872 it doesnt do students any good to reinforce concepts if theyre all at sea anyhow this is where the professor gets to find out whether her teaching is getting through
2200873 you know this is what i really hate about you all nicey nicey no results
2200874 im sympathetic to your feelings should we talk more about this

2200882 because what we did was take a great game gears of war 1 for xbox 360 made it run at higher resolutions and added three new hours of really good gameplay and it got lower reviews i think thats bullshit and i dont understand it i cant figure out what it is
2200883 like its an old game well yeah but its new on that platform so i was really surprised to see lower reviews for what i think a much better game it had new multiplayer modes new levels three hours of gameplay you never saw on 360 that the 360 guys are still upset we havent given them right so to get lower reviews for more game thats good it just doesnt make any sense

2200889 when they love you when they derek jeter you there must be no better feeling in the whole world i can only imagine to be loved by the whole city of new york like i love derek jeter personally like i am in love with that guy he is the nicest human being you cannot say a bad thing about him if youve ever met him or whatever youd love to and hes also really good looking
2200890 thats why a rod has trouble like the second best ever but hes playing on a team with the best ever and the best looking and the nicest guy who does not make a mistake
2200891 scores is not like it was in the early nineties so if you try any of that crap there youll get beat up and thrown out

2200898 both camps knew immediately after the abc interview with bill that they had repair work to do
2200899 worked out a hasty compromise whereby hillary clinton will speak tuesday night and bill clinton wednesday night
2200900 t wo nights out of four featuring the clintons is not what obama had in mind for his convention hell have to live with it
2200901 will have everyone paying attention to hillary clintons predictably pro obama speech
2200902 is that bill clinton will be overheard backstage trashing the nominee
2200903 more risk than the insta pundit reaction seems to be acknowledging
2200904 will possibly upstage his wifes and probably upstage the vice presidents
2200905 obama in even more of a pickle in making his vp choice
2200906 more news come out from clinton land about obama that could put the entire relationship in question again
2200907 that has uncovered about 200 internal clinton campaign memos discussing obama and campaign strategy
2200908 bills speech to be scrutinized endlessly by people searching for whatever hint of insufficient enthusiasm about obama they can find
2200909 hints that the people now running the show not only dont get bill clintons impact but also think they can absolutely win without him
2200910 gore campaign had hoped to choreograph mr clinton out of the picture at its convention
2200911 obama two chances to placate the two who could be a thorn in his side or a benefit to his campaign depending on how they act
2200912 might help momentarily but for obama the problems go far beyond the convention
2200913 deals with the clintons from here on out will always be a tricky and touchy issue
2200914 neanderthals made no lasting contribution to the modern human maternal dna gene pool
2200915 it isnt exactly a joyous time in america right now with 4 gas prices people who cant afford vacations wild prices on food and so forth

2200922 it was through my brother that i got interested in the save the wetlands program al recalled a few years back
2200923 my brother knew all of the good hunting spots he said
2200924 it was different back then lots of ducks fewer hunters and the hunters who were in the field were more educated about hunting than hunters are today
2200925 to help get the save the wetlands program going i lobbied at the legislature i educated people about the need for wildlife and wildlife habitat and i traveled the countryside to talk to people who lived near the types of things we were trying to save al said

2200931 they have a huge huge task in front of them
2200932 as far as i am considered they have solved it
2200933 i thought that they seemed to have this all wrapped up
2200934 most of us were thinking that this was it finally after a long long seven years
2200935 ordinarily we do not publicly disclose evidence against a suspect who has not been charged in part because of the presumption of innocence
2200936 but because of the extraordinary and justified public interest in this investigation today we are compelled to take the extraordinary step
2200937 theres too many things left out im not even close to being convinced
2200938 on the surface this looks like a convincing case but i have no confidence in the fbi
2200939 while the circumstantial evidence pointing to dr ivins that the department of justice released today is compelling a number of important questions remain unanswered such as why investigators remained focused on dr hatfill long after they had begun to suspect dr ivins of the crime and why investigators are so certain that ivins acted alone
2200940 its a little oasis here in forsyth county that we hope to keep as a green spot
2200941 the trees are a big sponge to absorb water and screen out pollutants
2200942 the petitioners im sure are headed to a higher court
2200943 then marriage would mean nothing it would mean whatever any foreign jurisdiction says
2200944 we dont want this to be another lee harvey oswald case where the public says it is never solved to their satisfaction
2200945 somebody needs to finish the job that would have been finished in a court of law
2200946 it was the richest experience ive ever had in my life
2200947 i had thought that i was the missionary one who was to teach the poor venezuelans how to live the christian life
2200948 he taught me more about spirituality and prayer and about being a good catholic christian than anybody else
2200949 he loved people and he accepted them as they were
2200950 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2200951 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2200952 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
2200953 three musicians who had recently been planning something with him told me he didnt tell them either
2200954 a close friend of his said he was a great eccentric sure he was also a beautiful soul i will miss him very much
2200955 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2200956 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2200957 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2200958 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2200959 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it

2200966 increasingly personal attacks on obama such attacks have raised worries among democratic strategists haunted by john f kerrys 2004 run and al gores razor thin loss in 2000 that obama has not responded in kind with a parallel assault on mccains character interviews with nearly a dozen democratic strategists found those concerns to be widespread although few wished to be quoted by name while obamas campaign is demanding unity
2200967 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2200968 after marathon bouts of campaigning obama is about to relent the presumptive democratic presidential nominee is heading off for hawaii on friday for a break that will be his last before the november election weighing the political risks of leaving the continental u s in the middle of the campaign obama conceded that the timing was not the best but he told reporters aboard his campaign plane this week that he didnt have much choice hes visibly tired gray hairs are sprouting perhaps more worrisome for obama a new poll shows voters may be tiring of him

2200970 catching the fish up north is cheaper and less disruptive to ocean ecosystems than trapping them in the tropics and the collections are rescue missions of a sort because these gulf stream travelers are unlikely to survive the winter
2200971 scientists do not know why the fish numbers seem to have increased but some species that are vulnerable to cold shock like the atlantic croaker appear to be expanding their range and ability to survive in the northeast because of climate change said kenneth w able a professor at the institute of marine and coastal sciences at rutgers university and the director of the universitys marine field station
2200972 he was interested in one thing primarily and that was to provide the best possible service to children and adults with cleft lip and palate

2200979 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
2200980 this is an incentive for people to make the right dietary choices
2200981 all three of these policies are forms of second guessing consumers
2200982 if there was an overwhelming demand for conspicuous calorie counts then businesses would respond to that the fact that you dont see it indicates that they are not really clamoring to have that information thrust in their faces
2200983 our clients are pretty sophisticated they want to have this information
2200984 our food is pretty clean to begin with our nutritional analyses will prove to be very good
2200985 its not intuitive thats why we have to give people this information my hope is that it will help them change their food choices people are still going to eat out but hopefully they will make good choices
2200986 my adrenalin was pumping and my eyes were wide open taking everything in

2200990 the room for error is like 3 feet you have to make 3 a different way and youve got to realize youre going to have to do that at some point
2200991 i find it easy for this course to visually intimidate you
2200992 the fairways are slopey the fairways are tight the greens are firm and slopey the pins were ridiculously hard

2200994 the charm of the olympic games dwells in its extraordinary inclusiveness
2200995 today people of different nations and religious backgrounds coming from 204 countries and regions have gathered under the olympic flag to celebrate this grand gala of humankind at this beautiful occasion where the melody of one world one dream rises to a crescendo our friendship is strengthened and our mutual understanding is deepened

2201000 not the second mark spitz im by no means downplaying his accomplishments what he did is was and still is the greatest olympic performance of all time
2201001 what ive been looking forward to for the last four years is finally here
2201002 ive had some life changing experiences and ive been able to get through some things this year
2201003 im happy with where i am right now i feel the best i ever have
2201004 so i would expect that you are going to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before and hell be unbelievable
2201005 i see three different areas that he would run up against as a difficulty
2201006 he has no control of the relays or what will happen
2201007 hell only participate as one of the members so there is always the risk of someone false starting or the team that tries to place them in the finals maybe does not get there you dont know
2201008 if i had to pay money to see one race at these games it would be the 100 fly
2201009 absolutely nothing one of the guys actually asked me today when i push off am i exhaling or am i holding my breath underwater and my answer was i have no idea i dont think about anything when i swim i just get in the water and race
2201010 whoever steps up that night is going to be the winner
2201011 i did have a little bit of breakdown i started to cry im not going to lie
2201012 i pride myself on if the pitcher doesnt give me a pitch to drive ill take my walk
2201013 thats what makes tex such a dynamic offensive player the fact that he handles a lot of different pitches but hes not going to expand his zone and swing at pitches he cant handle
2201014 hes always been like that i think if pitchers are coming after him hes more aggressive hes always had the discipline to lay off pitches he doesnt think he can handle
2201015 this day and age i think its rare to find a no 4 hitter who is as selective as he is and still hits for power as he does it gives him an opportunity to see more pitches that he can hit out of the ballpark
2201016 mark is a special player he can hit the ball out to any part of the ballpark with the plate discipline and the hitting ability that a middle of the order player needs in a championship caliber lineup
2201017 when you look at all the things he can do the list of guys who can do that gets shorter and shorter hes put himself in an elite group there are guys that can drive the ball there are guys that can work counts there are guys who can get the opposite field hit when you need it there are guys that play defense marks a guy that does so many things well that its a short list when you look at guys that are well balanced all the way around
2201018 he just doesnt give in that way some of our younger guys are seeing that and i think its good for them hes very disciplined sticks to his plan
2201019 to see a guy be able to take pitches like he does i think thats going to help a young guy like catcher jeff mathis for example i hope he sees that hes a guy who gets in a hitters count and hes swinging before the ball leaves the pitchers hand because hes thinking hes gotta throw me a strike he teixeira knows being in a hitters count doesnt necessarily mean youre always going to get the pitch you want to hit
2201020 the toughest thing about him is hes not going to chase like most power guys
2201021 a lot of power guys have a lot of holes in their swings theyll expand the zone to go after some pitches that makes him tough to pitch to
2201022 its pretty rare combination i dont think you see a whole lot of guys like that most power guys are more susceptible to strikeouts hes a hard guy to get to chase
2201023 ive always been an aggressive hitter so to watch tex hes so disciplined
2201024 sometimes i wished he would have swung 2 and 0 or 3 and 1 hes very disciplined hes very routine ish if thats a word almost to the point of being robotic
2201025 because guys didnt want to pitch to me i guess you learn to take your walks
2201026 my first couple years in the big leagues i realized pretty quick if youre swinging at the pitchers pitch youre going to get yourself out an awful lot
2201027 i learned to take my walks swing at pitches i wanted to swing at
2201028 its not easy i think theres a certain amount of god given talent to play this game then theres also the strength of your mind and experience
2201029 hes handling many more pitches in different zones now which is the normal progression than he did his first year
2201030 hes a very dangerous hitter but he had some areas that you could get to that were safer than they are now hes understanding what he can do hes either laying off stuff or hes driving it the other way he knows what he needs to do so hes become more productive
2201031 dr ivins had a history of mental health problems and was facing a difficult time professionally in the summer and fall of 2001
2201032 even with the celexa and the counseling the depression episodes still come and go thats unpleasant enough what is really scary is the paranoia
2201033 may not be those of depression or bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2201034 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when im being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home so i dont spread the pestilence

2201092 as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
2201093 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now

2201159 i must be one heck of a writer to have produced a pornographic book without any sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet mohammeds harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex in my book
2201160 it was my hope that my book would be a bridge builder develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country

2201218 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001

2201239 wir k nnen gegen st pauli sehen wie weit wir noch von der zweiten liga entfernt sind es werden mindestens 10 000 zuschauer zu dem spiel kommen das ist f r uns verpflichtung genug als absoluter au enseiter alles zu geben
2201240 aber der dfb pokal ist ein wettbewerb der mir immer viel spa bereitet hat man kann sich mit starken teams messen und zudem kann es eine lukrative angelegenheit werden
2201241 die mannschaft ist zu recht in der zweiten liga geblieben jetzt ist sie durch die zug nge noch ausgeglichener besetzt st pauli ist sehr kampfstark und wird uns alles abverlangen dass so viele zuschauer die partie sehen wollen spricht auch f r st pauli
2201242 sicherlich haben wir in der einen oder anderen situation nicht gl cklich ausgesehen aber die viererkette hat jetzt wieder an stabilit t gewonnen wir lassen uns jetzt keine abstimmungsprobleme einreden
2201243 vincent muss sich nicht sofort in den flieger setzen f r das pokalspiel in ingolstadt kommt er ohnehin nicht infrage
2201244 f r mich ist das eine gro e ehre und anerkennung
2201245 wenn die mannschaft zeigt was sie drauf hat dann sollten wir uns nicht in die hose machen
2201246 die jungs sind hei darauf von der leine gelassen zu werden
2201247 wir haben alles getan um m glichst viele informationen zu bekommen wir wissen worauf wir vorbereitet sein m ssen
2201248 es ist der k rzeste weg in das internationale gesch ft das klingt abgedroschen aber es ist eben die wahrheit
2201249 wir haben in den zur ckliegenden wochen gut gearbeitet es gibt nichts was uns berraschen k nnte
2201250 unsere leistungen waren wichtig f r den kopf gut f r das selbstvertrauen
2201251 meine jungs freuen sich auf das duell mit dem hsv wir haben nichts zu verlieren und unsere fans im r cken ich bin gespannt wie sich unsere junge truppe pr sentieren wird
2201252 f r mich ist das eine gro e ehre und anerkennung
2201253 we have recovered and have been given the power to help others
2201254 once more the alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink except in a few rare cases neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense his defense must come from a higher power
2201255 we ask especially for freedom from self will and are careful to make no request for ourselves only we may ask for ourselves however if others will be helped
2201256 take away my difficulties that victory over them may bear witness to those i would help of thy power thy love and thy way of life
2201257 we asked god to mold our ideals and help us to live up to them
2201258 neither could we reduce our self centeredness much by wishing or trying on our own power we had to have gods
2201259 without help it is too much for us but there is one who has all power that one is god may you find him now
2201260 what you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholics plight is in my opinion correct as to two of you men whose stories i have heard there is no doubt in my mind that you were 100 hopeless apart from divine help had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital i would not have taken you if i had been able to avoid it people like you are too heartbreaking though not a religious person i have profound respect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours for most cases there is virtually no other solution
2201261 some of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help
2201262 you have the mind of a chronic alcoholic i have never seen one single case recover where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you
2201263 if you are as seriously alcoholic as we were we believe there is no middle of the road solution we were in a position where life was becoming impossible and if we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid we had but two alternatives one was to go on to the bitter end blotting out the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best we could and the other to accept spiritual help
2201264 men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal
2201265 isnt it the sad thing is that real alcoholics die as the result feel free to contact the school and tell them how ignorant they a re about alcoholism and how
2201266 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2201267 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2201268 wir werden dort unterst tzen wo es uns m glich ist deshalb holen wir in einem ersten schritt alle wichtigen akteure an einen tisch und versuchen gemeinsam einen weg zu finden
2201269 unser ziel muss es sein die leistungsf higen mitarbeiter bergangslos an andere stellen zu vermitteln
2201270 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
2201271 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2201272 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2201273 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2201274 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2201275 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
2201276 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2201277 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2201278 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2201279 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2201280 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2201281 fixed problem where ui would not update after unsubscribing an imap folder
2201282 but there also had to be something that compels you to watch
2201283 nee ik weet van niks als het waar is wordt het alleen maar makkelijker voor ons
2201284 we hebben alles binnen de regels gedaan we zijn gewoon slimmer geweest dan zij maar we zijn zeker niet van goud verzekerd we nemen met dat zeil ook risico zo leveren we voor de wind best wel veel in dat is weliswaar ingecalculeerd maar toch
2201285 its probably going to take us another year to a year and a half to get it done
2201286 reeves you gotta pull this thing out its up to you
2201287 lyle and i have raised enough money to start our own company and were going to call it derrick dawson oil thats for derrick here and lyles dawson we bought some drilling rights in pennsylvania and well be pulling up stakes and heading out that way
2201288 well wheaties may be good for you but all those vitamins are gonna corrode your liver
2201289 where are you going in the car at this hour its dangerous to be out so late
2201290 no weve got to go right now your dads waiting
2201291 even though i do have a good hand im worried about j 10 because thats a typical limp in hand early in a tournament
2201292 i get three callers which is not really good news
2201293 it tells me i need help im basically done with the hand
2201294 i check the turn because i dont want to lose too much money if someone has j 10
2201295 with a lot of amateurs in the hand theres no guarantee that if somebody else has a 10 theyre not going to raise me and i dont know how to deal with a raise here because theres a good chance its the nuts in which case i have a tough decision to make
2201296 a guy id never played with before whod been pretty active bets 1 000
2201297 the pot was about 1 700 it gets folded to me and i call i really have no interest in check raising here because if he has j 10 im going to lose more money and if he doesnt have j 10 im either splitting or winning the pot so i call
2201298 a really good card for me if he has j 10 and a really bad card if he has q 10
2201299 im not interested in betting here id rather give him a chance to bluff
2201300 so i check he bets 1 500 i dont like it and i dont like my hand but i call and he shows the q 10 for a better straight
2201301 i couldve lost more if i decided to play the hand aggressively because hes not folding in hindsight checking and folding is a good option for me but i chose to pay it off because it was a player i hadnt seen and had been aggressive so it wasnt out of the question that he was bluffing
2201302 against a tight player who i knew i think id check and fold on the turn
2201303 i dont want to deny that the last races didnt go as i wanted every time something strange happened and we didnt manage to find the best possible set up for the car we tried to find a good compromise but it didnt help weve got to solve that problem now for the upcoming race at valencia
2201304 the qualifying was the decisive moment also at budapest in a negative way in my second try in q3 i couldnt keep the car on the track that was my fault
2201305 you cant pretend to win the title if youre always starting from the sixth position you can even drive one second faster per lap than the one ahead of you but if you start from behind you cant use the pace youve got
2201306 at the hungaroring i was stuck behind alonso who had a really good car for the last sector which was maybe the only point i could have tried to overtake again i had confirmed that its impossible to overtake at budapest
2201307 lewis hamilton is in fact the second coming of senna
2201308 i cant stand lewis hamilton and i hate to see him achieve any success in f1 the truth will set you free
2201309 das erste was ich sah war ein vater mit seinem sohn an der hand die blut berstr mt an mir vorbei liefen und leute die sich wie wild irgendwo festhielten es war schrecklich und chaotisch an bord
2201310 schon relativ fr h auf der r ckfahrt fiel eine ziemlich lange deckenleiste fast auf passagiere herunter die sch tzend ihre h nde ber den kopf hielten
2201311 die kamen dann herunter und die besatzungsmitglieder haben mit vereinten kr ften alles was irgendwie locker war herunter gerissen
2201312 die h tten in keinem moment viel mehr tun k nnen ihre hilfe war klasse
2201313 man hat uns bereits bei der hinfahrt auf norderney gesagt dass die wellen sehr hoch werden w rden auf der r ckfahrt und wir bekamen die m glichkeit das schiff zu verlassen das hatte mich schon ein bisschen stutzig gemacht
2201314 we did our due diligence over a period of 6 months and found the customer service and travel benefits offered by gold crown resort second to none and when my vice president met with the owners of gold crown in orlando and spent days at their home office we knew we had finally found the right company and product to represent
2201315 a membership with gcr is truly a wholesale travel opportunity for families that up until now has been unavailable to them
2201316 whether this really is a facebook worm and not simply malware being distributed via facebook spam remains to be seen
2201317 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access websites like facebook and myspace during office hours
2201318 if workers are allowed to be given access to these sites then its vital that they do not put their personal and corporate data at risk and are protected from web based infections
2201319 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2201320 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2201321 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2201322 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there
2201323 du hast ein alter ego und kannst einmal etwas v llig anderes machen
2201324 du findest im prinzip alle gesellschaftsschichten hier wieder es ist eben ein anderes hobby
2201325 the fact is that there is a growing awareness in rural communities such as ours that these new shopping centres do not create more shoppers but rather shift the focus of business away from the established cbd leaving empty and derelict shops destroying the character and charm of historic main streets
2201326 such streetscapes evoke strong impressions of decline and loss of confidence in the future of such towns
2201327 it is plain for all to see that forbes already has many empty shops in our cbd and it is hard to see where the developer of forbes central pty ltd is going find tenants for his proposed new complex and if he does how existing businesses would survive since some are already struggling
2201328 in short it is hard to see how this is good for forbes
2201329 our plans if approved will see a new modern store and car park on only one side of a broadened browns lane which is presently a busy and congested thoroughfare
2201330 our planned new shop and that of woolworths will replace existing business and both will have twice the present floor space to provide the townspeople with greater variety pleasant open shopping spaces and modern state of the art technology that will bring forbes up to the standards enjoyed by the most discerning sydney north shore shoppers
2201331 the forbes central proposal states that it would have a large supermarket as well as 10 specialty stores
2201332 viele radsportveranstalter haben uns vor vielen jahren m de bel chelt und sich gefragt warum wir uns den hohen organisationsaufwand f r jedermannrennen leisten
2201333 dass es der richtige weg war und zwar in zweierlei hinsicht erstens haben wir uns eine weitere vermarktungsquelle erschlossen und zum zweiten sind wir dadurch unabh ngiger geworden von verb nden und dem profisport
2201334 als sponsor ist f r uns eine rennen ohne profis denkbar aber nicht ohne jederm nner
2201335 gerade den cyclassics sei man seit der ersten veranstaltung 196 dauerhaft verbunden
2201336 bernie ecclestone will get sick of melbournes refusal to host a night race
2201337 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2201338 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2201339 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2201340 tatchi maybe its time to get out your uzi and blast this asshole back where he belongs

2201344 the passion will be lighted on the night of aug 8 offering the hundreds of thousands of spectators in the national stadium as well as hundreds of millions of people outside a spectacular performance
2201345 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2201346 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2201347 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2201348 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2201349 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2201350 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2201351 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
2201352 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
2201353 ich probierte meinen ersten smoothie und dachte so was m sste es auch in deutschland geben
2201354 wir waren beide auf den geschmack gekommen und wollten etwas eigenes machen
2201355 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2201356 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint
2201357 that introduced huge amounts of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere and subsequently us
2201358 as a new resident in forbes myself i am looking forward to attending country week and letting others know about the terrific benefits being a part of this community provides
2201359 the lifestyle on offer in forbes is superior to that of the city forbes has allowed partner chris and i the chance to buy a home of much better quality than we could have afforded in the city and it allows us to commute to work in a short period of time it really is such an easy transition from the city to forbes
2201360 through our own information and testimonials from new and established forbes employers we are going to demonstrate that forbes offers a lot of benefits to businesses considering a move including lower land and labour costs great location and freight availability as well as the support of the community and council
2201361 we are also providing those visitors who we quality as really being interested in a move with a package of great offers and incentives to bring their family for a visit to forbes
2201362 wir mussten acht personen aus dem wasser retten einer von ihnen kam mit dem verdacht auf einen herzinfarkt ins krankenhaus
2201363 vor allem an den wochenenden ist die au enalster mit hunderten von booten hoch frequentiert
2201364 die segler hatten den wind auf der alster untersch tzt
2201365 wegen der uferbebauung mit stra en relativ hohen h usern und br cken k nnen so genannte windkan le entstehen
2201366 auch am vergangenen mittwoch habe ich sie gewarnt zum gl ck waren alle rechtzeitig wieder im hafen zur ck
2201367 gef hrlich sind vielmehr die durch die lage der au enalster pl tzlich auftretenden b en bei windst rke 6 k nnen sie dann an bestimmen stellen acht beaufort erreichen und den skipper vor besondere herausforderungen stellen

2201369 a membership with gcr is truly a wholesale travel opportunity for families that up until now has been unavailable to them
2201370 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
2201371 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
2201372 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
2201373 the first thing i want to know about it is what the foundations can tell us about the architecture
2201374 how big was it how does it compare with the rose how does it compare with the globe how similar are they
2201375 the size of the theater will have an impact on the way the play is written
2201376 being so often surrounded by a sea of international flags languages and cultures was something that the students will remember for many years to come
2201377 even when services were spoken in other languages everyone basically knew what was going on and of course a smile is always a universal sign of friendship
2201378 even local sydney people not directly involved in world youth day were very hospitable towards the pilgrims
2201379 many times office workers and commuters would smile pat the pilgrims on the back welcome them to sydney and wish them well for the week
2201380 there was very little evidence of the negativity that was being reported in the weeks leading up to the event
2201381 would the students recommend world youth day to others most certainly
2201382 de onderhandelingen zijn al meer dan een jaar aan de gang en een akkoord was nabij
2201383 wij zullen niet dan 100 euro netto per maand opslag vragen voor elke werknemer

2201385 in tegenstelling tot het wi fi netwerk dat de wall of sheep kamer in de gaten houdt wordt het gesloten local area network van de perskamer als een veiligheidszone op het evenement beschouwd
2201386 deze aanval laadt elk object op elke locatie met elke permissie dan is het compleet game over
2201387 het is als een mes in een groot deel van de beveiliging van windows vista als je over het feit nadenkt dat net dll bestanden in de browser laadt en microsoft aanneemt dat ze veilig zijn omdat het net objecten zijn weet je dat microsoft er niet aan gedacht heeft dat dit een mogelijkheid zou kunnen zijn voor andere aanvallen dit is gewoon een echte tour de force
2201388 dit is niet supertechnisch deze twee onderzoekers zijn in staat om zeer low level technische aanvallen uit te voeren plus het is simpel en herbruikbaar
2201389 anytime youre getting supporters activated into online communities or taking other actions to spread the word thats a win
2201390 now that social media have expanded citizen comment opportunities far beyond the old letter to the editor and talk show call in campaigns should take advantage
2201391 im mike cornfield and im part of the mccain action team
2201392 talking points are fine but a comment should refer specifically to something that was said or written previously in the thread where it is intended to appear
2201393 people in politics arent motivated by points thats not what gets people to act theyre motivated by genuinely caring about the issues

2201397 back then i would get my paycheck and just pass it to arlene
2201398 i didnt think twice about what was coming in or going out
2201399 about 10 years ago you interviewed me for an article lately my publishers been on my back for not having internet access not doing online promotion not doing any promotion really so i thought id hit you up for some more free publicity
2201400 if you could slip a mention of the academy somewhere in the register i would greatly appreciate it
2201401 if not well at least you got a free book
2201402 dean koontz was signing books so i went and brought my crummy paperbacks for him to sign
2201403 turns out both of us had stories in the horror show and he recognized my name
2201404 he said give me your phone number ill call you and help you get an agent
2201405 i was out in the alley working on my car covered in grease my mom came running out and said dean koontz is on the phone he dictated a letter said say this and mention my name
2201406 i did and ive been with that agent ever since
2201407 id probably still be at some boring normal job if i hadnt met dean
2201408 and then you remember his accident where he almost was killed
2201409 he said oh nice to meet you and then his editor came in and said that its time to go
2201410 i sort of take summer off and christmas off whatever vacations my son has
2201411 i just live a regular life in a regular house
2201412 thats one of my greatest fears because many times ive seen these pathetic guys at the mall with a stack of books waiting for someone to show up
2201413 i guess because its my job its very hard for me to get scared
2201414 and i love to get scared thats why i got into this
2201415 i think close to 3 billion people are gonna be watching that game
2201416 the atmosphere is gonna be crazy were playing against the home team to open up the olympics and im pretty sure its gonna be crazy and energetic in there everybody in that building is gonna be jumping its the biggest game on the biggest stage in the world
2201417 i will have to take a breath at the beginning of this game
2201418 it is the start of the first olympic games to be played in china it is the event that my country and i have been looking to for seven years since beijing was awarded the games i am so happy that i have been able to recover from my foot injury to be ready to play against the usa team will be great challenge and a great honor
2201419 you can take a game 7 and times it by seven its gonna be something that nobodys experienced before i dont know if anybodys had a president come to a game to watch them play before
2201420 if you can just imagine and try to wrap your minds around the opening tip with dwight howard and yao ming as soon as that ball goes up every camera in the building is gonna be flashing
2201421 people are saying this is supposed to be the most watched event in basketball history for us to be a part of that for our kids our grandkids is something that will be something to look back on when were older honestly thats amazing
2201422 just thinking about this first game now you get goosebumps
2201423 its something well be able to tell our kids and our grandkids that we took part in the largest sporting event ever and you know theres been a lot of sporting events
2201424 state council will then make recommendations to the minister for primary industries on these issues for his consideration
2201425 the fine tuning of external boundaries is one of the most pressing and state council will consider the 25 submissions made by boards very carefully
2201426 board opinion financial viability common regional and agricultural interests and practicalities such as travelling distances will all be taken into account
2201427 state council will also discuss the selection and appointment process of an advisory committee made up of five directors and five staff members from local boards to provide advice on implementation issues
2201428 there have been some concerns aired regarding timeframes however its important we take advantage of the momentum built since the annual rlpb state conference in coffs harbour to deliver improvements to services sooner
2201429 state council is committed to having as much of the administrative and structural reform as possible in place by 1 january 2009 which will then pave the way to implement improvements to animal health and pest animal services from mid to late 2009
2201430 we hold a practical and open mind about the timeframes should circumstances change or there are factors outside our influence
2201431 we would also like reassure landholders that there will be no closures of shop fronts and no reduction in local field staff delivering animal health and pest animal services
2201432 local knowledge and experience will be retained and landholders can still visit their local board office to collect fox baits order stock identification tags or seek help in completing drought assistance forms
2201433 were looking at it as two games with balanced repetitions
2201434 he threw some nfl balls in there he did a nice job
2201435 its very very important for myself and my development for the team
2201436 that is the most important thing i think we had some good plays and a few solid drives but we have to continue to work on not turning the ball over
2201437 there are a couple of plays he wants back but i felt he did a good job moving our offense
2201438 he was in control and was sharp at times hell be fine and he knows better than anyone that we have to protect the ball
2201439 i guess fabian washington was worth that fourth rounder ozzie newsome general manager gave up
2201440 coach from men to a real man this is for you
2201441 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2201442 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2201443 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2201444 i cant put so much pressure on myself that i have to be perfect every play i hope i am but if something goes wrong its not the end of the world
2201445 you want to execute and you want to do well how i play in these games is going to determine who is going to be the starter all of these games are important
2201446 le monde est une com die pour ceux qui ont une t te une trag die pour ceux qui ont du coeur
2201447 nostalgia for the old colts is still very heavy but this is more than just a baltimore event
2201448 its to be a universal celebration of the game that really put pro football on the map and made it what it is today
2201449 the guys were blocking really well and they opened up some big holes
2201450 i was just glad i could hit them fast enough to get through making plays like that will really help our offense im glad we were able to put them in good positions to score
2201451 you only get one chance to make a first impression
2201452 so i felt like i had to go out and make an impact
2201453 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2201454 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2201455 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2201456 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2201457 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2201458 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer
2201459 im not a traitor never will be its business its the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give i hope the jets fans see the same thing
2201460 but i was the head coach so i made it a defensive timeout
2201461 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like
2201462 you talk about the rookies and how theyre going to respond im interested in how im going to respond

2201499 i believe everything happens for a reason and im in a great situation right here and im just ready to take advantage of it
2201500 what weve seen so far with jevan snead and some of the receivers weve got to rely on those folks and hope along the way we develop a strong running game to go with that

2201539 the person or persons responsible for the covert recording of conversations of senior mps at the national partys pre conference cocktail party may live to regret it

2201562 it is my understanding that this book like other university publications was intended to support our marketing initiatives by informing various constituencies of our accomplishments
2201563 if it was to market the university they should have marketed the university not one individual they just dont get it

2201570 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
2201571 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
2201572 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me

2201580 as we adjust our sports budgets in response to the rapidly increasing costs associated with operating our 19 sport program it became essential that we increase revenue from mens basketball ticket sales it is crucial that we generate the additional resources needed for our more than 450 student athletes to compete and succeed in the southeastern conference and nationally

2201603 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2201604 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back

2201629 zionists believe israel should not be defended from war criminals who bomb jewish communities indiscriminately to murder children with millions of landmines
2201630 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
2201631 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
2201632 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
2201633 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens
2201634 i grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me as the bullets began to fly the blood sprayed from between her eyes and then i laughed maniacally
2201635 the mass murdered unarmed innocent neighbors back door was open
2201636 it amounts to collective punishment and is contrary to international humanitarian law
2201637 more than 250 torture victims come forward to sue caci
2201638 our government has no power except that granted it by the people
2201639 the pentagon is seeking executions of innocent torture victims who allege they did every last terrorist act of the last 50 years

2201647 lance corporal tatum entered a home and participated in the killing of iraqis who were not legitimate targets then entered a second home and participated in the murder of more innocent women and children

2201649 it is not george bush it is not the neocons
2201650 these are the people who have overthrown elected governments all over the world and he richard perle comes on your program to prattle about democracy
2201651 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves
2201652 those who negotiate in the name of the taliban will be killed

2201659 dance music has always been seen as a second class citizen in the music world here
2201660 the biggest prob lem is theres no real support for dance music on the radio or in the media like there is in europe especially in england

2201662 youve got a lot of embassy kids who are here because of the nature of the government work
2201663 its a more cosmopolitan international mix of people theyre coming with an exposure to dance music and an expectation of a club experience thats different than we normally have in baltimore
2201664 even i had followed louisville and saw how coach petrino had running backs catching a lot of passes out of the backfield i was worried in the back of my mind
2201665 but when coach petrino got here and showed us the offense he told us its going to take everybody to get the job done its not the quarterbacks show its not the receivers show it takes everybody
2201666 our first two years at louisville we averaged 200 yards per game rushing
2201667 we had four running backs eric shelton lionel gates michael bush and kolby smith go on to the nfl
2201668 bobby petrino fits his plays to the talents of that player
2201669 he makes sure our big back does big back things he makes sure our small back does small back things he plays to the strengths of everyone
2201670 everybody is being evaluated including me to see how each of us can help us win
2201671 we understand for our running game to be good it will take all of us as a unit
2201672 at first i thought in your honor should be an acoustic album and that we should start exploring that side of the band and that dynamic and go out and do something different
2201673 there wasnt a shortage of material for the acoustic record it was actually the rock record that posed the biggest challenge
2201674 look lets get these hard rock tunes out of the way the same way weve always done em then we can move on to these sweet songs i have here

2201691 this year is going to feel like when i used to go to my dads games stand on the sidelines and watch him coach
2201692 i just have to stand there and cheer but its going to be tough to stand there and be a cheerleader
2201693 we threw ryan in there monday and he looked really good
2201694 he improved his footwork and release he threw the ball real accurate
2201695 he has to make sure he has a real good redshirt year ryans personality is such hell do whatever you ask him to do hell see some time on the scout team this year when we play a team with a dropback thrower and we need a picture of that
2201696 i had my fingers crossed but it didnt happen and i was disappointed
2201697 but being in the system a full year before i play will help me develop along with these young receivers and offensive line
2201698 the game seems to come really easy to him we have a gap at linebacker to fill so hell get a lot of reps
2201699 hes come in here with an attitude to be a starter on this team when you have that attitude youre not going to take a play off youre going to play hard every play
2201700 i felt that hunger when i saw the fans at the rebel clubs throughout mississippi this summer
2201701 i felt their enthusiasm and it has filtered down to our players i can see the hunger in their eyes and how much they want to win
2201702 houston nutts body of work is out there for everyone to see
2201703 its been great to be back but its been that way because of houston nutt
2201704 there is a lot more of it around here now coach nutt knows a lot about the sec and how to win in this league
2201705 there is a huge difference a lot of little things
2201706 we may have had seven or eight of those types of days
2201707 but with coach nutt its different they teach us in the morning and then in the afternoon well have the one full pad practice i think that will save the toll on our body
2201708 we got away from two a days for the past three or four years it doesnt do you any good to do it if you have 11 guys in bed with ivs
2201709 i feel like we have a great classroom setting here with this indoor facility we want to be able to teach our concepts in the morning and then take it to the field with full energy in the afternoon i think it will keep them fresh
2201710 thats our biggest hurdle did you win a game in the sec last year no
2201711 its all about getting the components to fit it starts with the seniors and then you identify your playmakers who are the guys who can make plays i think weve found one in our quarterback jevan snead i trust his decision making
2201712 this will be as good an incentive as ive offered if not better in most cases
2201713 its to help stabilize the area especially the west side of johnson street where weve been hit the hardest by foreclosures
2201714 if its a popular program well try to allocate more funding
2201715 at the turn of the century that was what was popular
2201716 what we ended up really liking and ended up doing was putting on a tempur pedic mattress on it so you get a lot of support to me it feels better than having a box spring
2201717 when people think of a contemporary look they think of platform beds

2201720 oracle retails experience with retail organizations across the world and its industry specific best practices will help arvind brands achieve its desired customer centricity and profitability while allowing them to compete more effectively in the rapidly growing indian market
2201721 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2201722 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2201723 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2201724 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2201725 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
2201726 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2201727 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2201728 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions

2201731 every election there is a deluge of complaints of alleged registered voters who are not able to vote for various reasons while some claims could be meritorious some could also be a ploy designed to discredit the election process

2201738 though theyre still members of their professional group a lot of agents are now bailing out of the business at least for the time being some have taken salaried jobs or retired others have cut back to part time
2201739 buyers are so powerful and they know it if they get scared or unhappy they may try to back out of the deal before it closes so it falls to the listing agent to keep the deal from falling apart
2201740 lenders are really skittish now the agents involved in the transaction have to make sure everything in the buyers file is perfect or the lenders wont let the loan go through
2201741 a shallow interview with just one person is not enough you need to approach this as a serious business transaction interview several agents ask in depth questions and listen intently to their replies
2201742 why dont we rip up the backyard and plant a meadow
2201743 its relatively difficult for these invasives to get established once the meadow is dense and thick
2201744 but until then the seeds can be in the ground already and when theyre disturbed they start taking off
2201745 we had to cut it off at 200 this year
2201746 the savings in water fertilizing and mowing is usually an ancillary thing
2201747 occasionally we hear people say i hate yellow or i want pink
2201748 a diaspora of different plants and times and places a sort of knit together group of plants to make sure all the bases in the meadow are covered and there isnt any room for weed seeds to germinate
2201749 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
2201750 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
2201751 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it

2201755 we create a series of golf challenges that they compete in and each show someone gets eliminated

2201757 i dont know why they printed that because we certainly havent confirmed locations yet
2201758 were not even allowed to talk about it until after the show has been filmed
2201759 we installed slackware on this old computer i had in my office that was my introduction to open source a student id work with knew about linux and he helped set it up i learned how to admin the box then he graduated and went off so i was the person holding the bag it was a great experience to find out theres this easier and cheaper way an organization could get online
2201760 i had been doing c programming for some research folks when i graduated i was either going to become a programmer or go to graduate school
2201761 i work with my clients to help them figure out the best way to implement technology i help them write bid requests hire web design vendors do project management
2201762 i work with clients who are using various types of open source software
2201763 it was quite serendipitous some colleagues of mine had mentioned me as a possible person to help them out
2201764 i got into open source primarily because i saw it as a way to level the playing field
2201765 i had been working with nonprofit organizations for a very long time and one of the things thats been a real issue for me is that many of these organizations dont have a lot of resources and they want to spend their resources on helping people as opposed to spending them on it its been troubling that in order to get good software theyre forced to spend a lot of money that should be spent on helping people so for me its a lot about putting software in the hands of everybody
2201766 for me thats the primary benefit of open source i dont have anything against proprietary software its fine if you want to pay for it but for me its a crime that organizations that really need good software and do amazing work in the world are often constrained in their ability to get it i value very much the other ideals of open source that you can get at the code and modify and change it if you want to but the way in for me was the level the playing field thing
2201767 this is true over the long term and for all types of different software
2201768 it ebbs and flows i was using drupal and it was atrocious and now its great wordpress was really hard to use and now its like amazing all of this stuff goes through those phases the linux desktop i end up always giving up theres a lot of reasons why that happens but its gotten much better compared to what it was even three years ago
2201769 i would like to see more people of various types and varied levels of expertise involved id like it to be less totally geek driven and more reflective of the wide range of people in the world im not sure how that would happen its not necessarily the open source communitys fault but i think that there would be a lot of interesting benefits if there were more people like designers involved and users who could actually find ways to contribute that are not programming
2201770 i really value the open source community i value the linux community and the incredible amount of work that has gone into making it it takes a lot to make an operating system and to make all the tools in the end when things all shake out down the road i think that linux and other open source operating systems in general will actually triumph i remember that huge pile of floppies in 1995 and how much work it took to get slackware up and now it takes five minutes to get a server up its sort of trivial having watched that its been really amazing even though ive had my own struggles with it i still understand how amazing it has been in the end its going to be linux and thats really cool to me
2201771 i see you you are beautiful and your belly is a glorious amazing gift
2201772 but now thanks to you i am expecting one thing and thats to go to the gym on monday

2201810 but in some of the traditional countries like mexico theyre used indoors as beds space is tight and you can take them down quickly also people use them because of their comfort and to be off the ground and away from the bugs rodents and things

2201818 i know that when i graduate from there a lot of doors will be opened for me that wouldnt have been opened if i had chosen to go somewhere else for football it is a great place but it is a lot more than that and all of that weighed into my decision
2201819 i have been up there to south bend twice and when was up there it was just a sense that all the coaches were so down to earth they were all like father figures and they were all in charge but they understood that they had to let the players have their own personalities some it was the perfect fit
2201820 every program has its ups and downs and some could say that notre dame has been down but if you look at the people the program has coming in they are going to be back on top very soon a big part of me going there is that i wanted to be there for when notre dame is back on top and i think that will happen in my time there

2201839 we achieved highly encouraging second quarter organic sales growth despite a difficult economic environment still characterized by significantly increasing raw material costs and a weak us dollar

2201897 traditionally over the last 30 or 40 years some treatments have crept into our repertoire without being robustly tested
2201898 what we found rather surprisingly is these treatments did not produce a greater chance of pregnancy leading to live birth compared to no treatment
2201899 we have a ways to go but we are very excited about the talent we have on this team the entire squad has a good attitude
2201900 for the first time everyone finished their fitness test and thats a sep in the right direction this year we have a lot more people on the team and having a lot of numbers helps with depth
2201901 we are going to have different battles for playing time this year
2201902 all three of our goalkeepers came in mentally ready to play they need to improve their fitness that being said if we can get consistency in goal this year we will be a better team because it will build the confidence of the rest of the team
2201903 we could also play so many combinations in our line up competition will be good all around at the forward sots we will see who battles it out we have a lot of quality players that play up top
2201904 she had a good summer playing with her club team im very pleased with her performance on the field im sure she had a little case of nerves but it was positive not only for her but also for her team shes a good player who should help us this season
2201905 now we have more than doubled our numbers we have to work hard on the field but we also are making sure that we open up and embrace the newcomers we want them to understand that we all have the same goals and we are in for a great season
2201906 this year we are excited about the upcoming season and about having half a new team
2201907 we have high expectations as a team we want to do really well and make sure that we are cohesive if we work together and have the same goal it could be a special season

2201911 at lunchtime on the day i was both confident and nervous but when it came to the fight i had one of the coaches as my corner man he just calmed me down and i was not cool but not really nervous either
2201912 ive not really made my mind up if im going to go back it requires such dedication and if you cannot give it 100 per cent then dont do it

2201917 the mist in the air that we see is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
2201918 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
2201919 but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
2201920 respiratory and heart diseases related to air pollution are the leading cause of death in china

2201924 a mere one percent of people living with hiv aids are reported to have been screened for tb
2201925 one of the great tragedies of this epidemic is that people who are living with hiv after hard fought battles for access to antiretroviral treatment go on to die needlessly from tb
2201926 persons living with hiv aids are 50 times more likely to develop tuberculosis than those who are hiv negative

2201929 if you talk about big surprises in baltimore media this would be one of them
2201930 after years of sometimes being at odds with the paper its an astonishing thing
2201931 it strengthens the newspaper to have a broad spectrum of perspectives
2201932 a vibrant commentary page features a variety of voices weve often relied solely on the syndicated columnists to provide that mix when we have strong independent voices right here in baltimore
2201933 will create even more discussion and debate on the issues
2201934 hell have a wide license to tackle issues he wants to tackle there may even be some occasions when he will be critical of the newspaper
2201935 if what tim franklin is asking for is a conservative voice

2201939 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2201940 the department proposes to define abortion as any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2201941 most prophylactic preventive measures need to be given early after the injury
2201942 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute their readings

2201946 patients should talk to their physicians about setting goals together for reducing blood pressure and cholesterol and making a plan to achieve the goals
2201947 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity

2201963 with struggles being waged by black people in the areas of education housing employment and many others it was only a matter of time before afro american athletes shed their fantasies and delusions and asserted their manhood and faced the facts of their existence
2201964 a lot of the black athletes thought that winning olympic medals would supersede or protect them from racism but even if you won a medal it aint going to save your momma from the effects of racism it aint going to save your sister
2201965 because i have lost lots of money and still am

2201972 the new brand store serves as a great platform to engage our consumers in a unique way by experiencing the under armour brand first hand
2201973 the stores are designed to build deeper relationships with our consumers and to tell the under armour brand story
2201974 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities
2201975 consumers will be very tight fisted in the coming months
2201976 nothing shuts down the consumer and the economy like the loss of a job
2201977 the job market isnt strong right now as we work through the downturn in housing and high energy prices we would like to see more job creation
2201978 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2201979 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2201980 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2201981 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
2201982 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2201983 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
2201984 we lost a good group of seniors from last years team but well have a very talented group of players in camp this year will be a little more special with the new turf at sherman field

2202003 two weeks before a lot of people got elected in 94 nobody even knew who they were it can happen
2202004 clearly registration in a lot of districts is moving away from republicans

2202017 petitioner has failed to explain why the term eliminates is inherently argumentative while the term limit is not
2202018 the attorney general is not required to make any such distinction and even if he were petitioner has not shown that a meaningful distinction exists between the purpose and effects of this particular initiative
2202019 theres really no surprise that a court would find that the primary purpose of this is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
2202020 unequivocally no ill have thanksgiving dinner on the first floor of the capitol with the governor before ill borrow
2202021 as the governor said he will not sign any legislation until a budget is passed
2202022 the governors message was clear focus on the budget and the budget only
2202023 clearly the governor wants everybody to focus on the budget
2202024 in this case hes reviewed this bill already and im hoping that will make a difference
2202025 the governor himself told a national television audience that flip flopping is a great thing that it is a wonderful thing when someone has made a mistake and is able to be honest about it and change his mind
2202026 i will continue to fight for the 5 million to 6 million california workers who fear getting sick and losing their job
2202027 in an already troubled economy california should be seeking ways to stimulate job growth and avoid forcing costly mandates on employers
2202028 the tactical team is finished and its a closed deal but remember that weve been through this before and every time we close a deal its reopened
2202029 weve seen all the status of forces agreements with other countries
2202030 i mean is this going to be something we cant even interpret through polling we can talk about the bradley effect because of what happened to tom bradley when he ran for governor of california and won in the polls twice and lost the governorship twice on election day ive seen theories about this that unless the african american candidate is able to get the election number he needs he wont get it that day he has to get it in the polling and barack hasnt cracked about 45 percent
2202031 pollsters look for the bradley effect the idea that some white voters are reluctant to say they support a white candidate over a black candidate the phrase refers to californias 1982 gubernatorial election when the late tom bradley a black democratic mayor of los angeles led in exit polls against white republican george deukmejian mr bradley lost the election the conclusion some voters hid their true choice from pollsters
2202032 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed

2202035 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
2202036 one of the things that makes us unique is we dont sentence based on passion we sentence based on law
2202037 this relatively light sentence could not possibly have been what the prosecution was hoping for especially after all of the time money and resources expended
2202038 i wish you godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2202039 and i hope that you are able to be a father and a provider and a husband in the best sense of the word
2202040 an indianapolis companys long delayed plan to build a 430 million racetrack casino in lawrence county has gotten some dire financial news and could be on life support a financial news service called debtwire said yesterday that lenders for centaur inc
2202041 pushed centaur into a corner and as a result its proposed valley view downs racetrack casino west of new castle may become a victim of roiled financial markets
2202042 one person who might have seen the writing on the wall and is rooting for the collapse of the centaur deal is gettysburg motorcycle dealer david levan who two years ago wanted to build a controversial stand alone casino just outside gettysburg and now thinks the centaur failure may provide him another opening this doesnt come as a surprise to me its one of the reasons i went public a couple of weeks ago he said yesterday he said he wanted to send a message to the harness racing commission and the gaming board letting both know there are other options
2202043 indiana based centaur inc might have to step aside as sole owner of a proposed horse track and slots casino in lawrence county and look for financial help from a private investment group a county official said thursday lawrence county commissioners chairman steve craig responding to reports that the 425 million valley view downs project is experiencing serious financial trouble said he still thinks the facility will be built it just might not be built exclusively by centaur he said

2202048 once an elite horse racing state that dominated the mid atlantic maryland has been brought down by a competitive imbalance with tracks in neighboring states that grew powerful after slot machines were legalized and began fueling race purses the maryland industry hopes a slots referendum going before voters nov 4 will level the playing field but for now it struggles small however sees more to it the mtha for years has set as its ideal year round racing in the state but small believes there is a glut of racing in the mid atlantic and trainers should not expect stall space to be subsidized when the tracks are out of season

2202070 the economy in euro land is not sinking but its moving closer to the zero line than one would have expected only several weeks ago
2202071 got to factor in the economy i would expect at some point in the next six to 12 months for the ecb to even lower interest rates the recession in the us has been factored in and the weakness in the euro land is just beginning to be factored in
2202072 since our account has been seized weve been in a very tough situation
2202073 we cant pay salaries or holiday pay to the papers 12 staff members because of the investigators actions the interrogations and the tense atmosphere surrounding de facto staff have been forced to go on leave until august 20
2202074 an initial investigation shows that the points set out in the statement moldoevas letter are incorrect in other words that they are deliberate falsehoods designed to accuse dalbaev of serious crimes
2202075 recently we lost a court case brought by president kurmanbek bakievs nephew for one million soms 27 000 us dollars and now we have this police search and the criminal case which have left de facto with no computers
2202076 the authorities have decided not to confine themselves to a million soms they want to shut down the only opposition newspaper
2202077 an unidentified male voice warned me that id face serious problems if i didnt leave the newspaper the previous time they used obscene language and asked me why i wouldnt shut up
2202078 the decision to bring a criminal prosecution against the newspaper instead of a civil suit the freezing of its accounts the threats received by its editor and the speed with which the judicial authorities acted are all disproportionate and suggest that the real aim is to force de facto to close
2202079 the launch of criminal proceedings is political persecution that has undoubtedly been sanctioned in order to destroy the free press and intimidate journalists
2202080 no one is planning to eliminate the newspaper at all
2202081 i read this newspaper myself and im aware it has many thousands of readers no one is going to close it
2202082 the newspaper should have published material that was not erroneous and that strove for the truth ive told the newspaper about this and now it is for the law enforcement agencies to resolve the matter
2202083 it is wrong to open a criminal case and persecute the newspaper for such reasons anyone who disagrees with an article can go to court and resolve matters by that route without punitive action
2202084 the fact that they took away equipment opened a criminal case and seized the newspapers account is a very grave violation of the law and an encroachment on freedom of speech
2202085 i believe it was wrong to launch a criminal case under the deliberately false accusation clause its also dangerous as it could set a bad precedent for a broader trend
2202086 despite the threats and problems the newspapers staff have taken these developments stoically

2202132 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2202133 but theyre all over me its like there is a campaign to demean me
2202134 we are delighted with the arrival of renaud dutreil at lvmh
2202135 his experience and skills will contribute to the growth of lvmhs businesses in the united states
2202136 france owes a lot to bernard arnault his is also frances success its a country of artisans creators winemakers designers guardians of tradition that have made lvmh the world leader of beauty
2202137 i think the defensive end of the court is what weve worked on the most
2202138 we feel actually its a strength our guys are playing hard they play together they have each others back i think in order for us to win our defense has got to be the key
2202139 each position each guy understands how to play defense at a high level
2202140 its no different really than on the lakers its just on the lakers i have to do a lot more i dont have lebron james and chris paul and all those guys with me so here i get to focus in a lot more on playing defense i dont have to exert so much energy on offense
2202141 we can all go back to our respective teams and be offensive juggernauts or whatever we may be
2202142 but for right now we all understand if we dont play defense we wont win we have to play smart intelligent team defense
2202143 were not a big team and we have to take advantage of our speed and our athletic ability so were going to attack
2202144 with our guys we have extended our defense thats a style that we feel is necessary and weve tried to put a team together thats capable of doing that
2202145 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2202146 how cool how good is it that were going to play in a game that might be the most viewed game in the history of sport come on
2202147 i remember growing up inner city of chicago shooting at a basket in a schoolyard hoping that one person would watch me and now im going to have a chance to coach my countrys team in front of a billion people are you kidding
2202148 the energy the one thing about these games is that they are shorter games than nba games teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2202149 i love the chinese people and i love the fans here so hopefully they wont hate us too long
2202150 when he got hurt i was more concerned with him being healthy than anything because i know how big and how important playing in front of his country is to him
2202151 hes not going to score 100 points and we hope to come close to scoring 100 points
2202152 i think you have to make sure that he doesnt dominate the game
2202153 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2202154 that means that were watched by a lot of people
2202155 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available

2202160 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life
2202161 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
2202162 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
2202163 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2202164 typically when you have strong activity during july thats also a very strong indicator the remainder of the season will be above normal
2202165 a fascinating journey of real life stories a solid theoretical overview and practical tools and take us deep into the setup of different cultures how they function sources of potential collisions and how best to benefit from this wonderful diversity that todays globalization provides
2202166 effective multicultural teams theory and practice is a profound powerful and fascinating text for graduate students who want to have a better understanding of the basics of multicultural teams this book is the result of several years of teaching consulting and researching by the authors on various relevant issues of multicultural teams the breadth and depth of coverage of this book are extraordinary and its educational importance cannot be over estimated it offers a comprehensive approach for creating an effective bridge between theory and practice in todays globalized market economy both profit and non profit sectors are emphasizing performance improvement at all levels of their activities and this cannot be achieved without maximizing the benefits of cultural diversity on many aspects this publication goes beyond the simple quick fixes of high performing multicultural teams by adding life experiences which are inspirational and practical
2202167 this book offers something that few other textbooks do an accessible and understandable approach to discern the implications of complicated research i was most impressed with the use of research from so many different cultures too often we take a western or even a u s perspective and assume that our way is the best way without understanding the cultural contexts this material certainly avoids that trap
2202168 parents who have not had their children vaccinated with the mmr vaccine should do so now
2202169 the evidence on mmr is absolutely clear there is no link between the vaccine and autism
2202170 the mmr vaccine coverage is not high enough to remove the threat of recurrence of measles outbreaks measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal delaying immunisation puts children at risk
2202171 we cannot stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the mmr vaccine overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe
2202172 nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
2202173 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
2202174 this decision once again raises questions about whether nices system of appraisal is appropriate for all types of drugs
2202175 although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion
2202176 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
2202177 how many places have things in the yard that can eat you not just bite or sting you but actually take you as prey
2202178 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players
2202179 the luxury tax in the nba has put a crimp on what teams can spend so players are looking for alternatives
2202180 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
2202181 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
2202182 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that caliber
2202183 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
2202184 it just shows you what a global game basketball is that there are good leagues and leagues that are willing to pay for high caliber talent
2202185 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment
2202186 without there being a players association and a collective bargaining agreement in europe theres nothing behind the contract to enforce them other than to go to court
2202187 for europe to truly get to the point where they can compete with the nba for all kinds of players theyre going to have to implement a system where theres a lot more comfort that the contracts are truly guaranteed once that happens then i think youll truly see great competition for players
2202188 we could have came to an agreement last year so i think thats the window of opportunity for a lot of teams
2202189 he brings added veteran leadership and playoff experience to our backcourt
2202190 a terrific ball handler with great passing ability and court vision
2202191 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2202192 we unreservedly apologize both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2202193 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
2202194 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumors that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
2202195 until a few years ago there was no privacy law in this country and each case tried to stretch it a bit further
2202196 the mosley case was the one that stretched it that bit further still with the judge quite clear in his reasoning its forced editors to be more careful certainly in a case of this nature where its a very high profile royal
2202197 if a newspaper gets a story about a footballer having a sex orgy with a
2202198 as a free over the air broadcaster that depends on advertising revenue for income and over the decade weve owned the station weve not had the level of support we had projected
2202199 and as expenses increase advertising revenues had to increase commensurately
2202200 the sole effect of the artificial snow is on the tribes subjective spiritual experience
2202201 a government action that decreases the spirituality the fervor or the satisfaction with which a believer practices his religion is not what congress has labeled a substantial burden on the free exercise of religious freedom
2202202 in a nation that prides itself on religious freedom and rights for all it should be intolerable that it is good for everyone except native americans
2202203 what we have is generally a bunch of non natives becoming arbiters of indian religion which is not the role of the court

2202207 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
2202208 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2202209 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

2202215 rather than thinking about what a customer needs marketers have to think long and hard about the words they use what a waste of time
2202216 this reminds me of the carpet we used to have in our yukon house

2202226 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2202227 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2202228 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2202229 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2202230 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2202231 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2202232 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2202233 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2202234 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2202235 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2202236 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2202237 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2202238 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2202239 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the license we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up

2202243 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos

2202245 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2202246 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2202247 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking

2202260 a year and a half after the debut of facebooks web site it was built by copying the look feel and features of facebook com
2202261 facebook is concerned that because studivz looks like facebook and incorporates similar features and functionality to facebook users will incorrectly believe that studivz is associated with facebook
2202262 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions

2202267 he always had this little mischievous grin on him and a little twinkle in his eyes that always made you wonder what he was up to
2202268 he was a very curious energetic young man he was very athletic and i would say that he was a little more of a risk taker especially on the playground
2202269 he looked like an athlete even at that age he didnt have to do any extra laps for shenanigans
2202270 he stood out as a kid that had a lot of potential
2202271 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2202272 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2202273 i had people coming up to me in the street shouting at me
2202274 i want to thank everyone for their support throughout this whole situation
2202275 and i want to thank my legal team for all their hard work mr banasko has put in such a lot of hard work
2202276 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2202277 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2202278 this goes to show the people of japan and the government of japan that they can be reassured that the united states navy will be forthright in disclosing details about any inadvertent release of radioactivity even when it is extremely small
2202279 surreptitiously authored and endorsed a document which sought to whittle down niger delta and nddc powers to disburse funds and make them more accountable to the people of the region
2202280 we take strong exception to import of the remarks in the story which seem to suggest that the vice president indicted the governors and nddc for

2202282 as part of the investigation assistance was requested and provided by the ontario provincial police behavioural sciences section
2202283 it was determined during an interview of the complainant on july 6th that the abduction did not occur
2202284 the espanola police service is no longer looking for the two native males or a red truck
2202285 it is important to get this message out to the community and surrounding areas that the allegation made at this time appears to be false
2202286 a 13 year veteran of the police service told him he had never seen such a vicious assault in all hit time on the force
2202287 numerous tips had been received both directly from citizens and also through crime stoppers this information and assistance was greatly appreciated

2202290 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2202291 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2202292 trinity was an innocent and random victim of identity theft apparently so were four or five other county residents whose names and addresses were stolen and used as addresses on drug packages
2202293 however trinity and our family have not been treated as victims of a crime instead our home was invaded our two beloved labrador retrievers are dead my mother in law and i were tied up for nearly two hours
2202294 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2202295 we could have gotten the mayor to put the dogs away and consent to a search
2202296 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2202297 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2202298 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2202299 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2202300 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
2202301 there is a fundamental rethink in the alignment between the major currencies with the u s dollar coming out on top despite ongoing turmoil in the financial sector
2202302 people are not going to trust annapolis if decisions are made in back rooms in secret
2202303 i respect the traditions of the office but im following the advice of my lawyers
2202304 so long as thats not happening they have no issue with it
2202305 i think that its discourteous and a waste of resources
2202306 its still somewhat of a mystery to me how they ended up with the contract
2202307 it is important that we continue to send the strong message that small minority and women owned firms that have historically been shut out of far too many business opportunities will receive a fair chance to compete
2202308 i think the thing about her thats kind of cool is that mary ellen had a broad range of experience that often makes for a better judicial selection
2202309 the confirmed reserve of this field is 1 billion barrels and we believe that it will be doubled after this exploration mission
2202310 it is a new move that aims at boosting the oil sector after the improvement in the security situation
2202311 there was a perception that if you violated export law you could just pay a small fine and go on down the road
2202312 it can be very overwhelming to a small company that wants to export their little widget they dont realize what theyve created could be on the department of commerces list
2202313 it does create an uneven playing field because the company that doesnt know about it doesnt wait for the license
2202314 of course it can be more expensive if people pay fines
2202315 were looking at using this lander for all we can get out of it
2202316 we want to come up with the best we can do between now and the end of september thats our expectation
2202317 we are not at the point to slap each others backs and offer congratulations but we will be at that point by the end of the mission
2202318 i think it will go down as a great mission but we still have our jobs to do before that happens
2202319 the extended mission is very important for understanding the seasonal changes
2202320 its going to be very helpful to have more time to complete the analysis with the idea of using all eight tega ovens
2202321 were trying to become one of the top 10 research universities in the country and so you have a mission like this that is getting international attention people realize what is going on and say that this is the place to come and do scientific research
2202322 i think this is going to be a huge boon for tucson and the university
2202323 in return were trying to get another project so we can keep the ball rolling
2202324 there are other opportunities coming in the future as always at the moment the next available mission to mars in 2016
2202325 once the sun sets the amount of energy the solar panels produce obviously goes down the temperatures go down when the sun goes down so the energy we have to use of that restricted resource goes up to keep the temperatures high enough so we dont freeze
2202326 so all these things combine to the point that we believe by the time we get to the end of september we are going to be down to about 350 watt hours per sol so we wont be able to aggressively do what we have been doing
2202327 it doesnt mean we wont be able to continue to operate
2202328 it just means we will have to slow down a bit on what we are doing on a sol to sol basis
2202329 i dont know what the repercussions are in terms of 2014
2202330 we have to reconfigure and move forward how i dont know yet
2202331 our real focus is on whats in front of us this moment
2202332 were working on getting a formal development agreement and then using city resources to allow us to get an architect design team and construction manager on board
2202333 neither of these companies have properly provisioned for what were heading into
2202334 this thing is going to get worse and last longer and deeper than they originally thought
2202335 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2202336 in addition credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience in july we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves
2202337 the one advantage that fannie has it that it did raise capital when the window was open to them
2202338 fannie mae will be marginally profitable in the back half of this year and in 2009
2202339 its encouraging on the inflation front we are seeing good cost control from businesses its good news for the fed
2202340 historically productivity growth has tended to suffer during periods of energy price shocks
2202341 the current year over year growth rate of just a shade under 3 percent demonstrates an impressive degree of resilience
2202342 our actions to improve operational efficiency get our regional companies back on track and reduce overhead costs have been effective
2202343 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
2202344 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
2202345 its a start i suppose im glad they did it but i think for most investors its not the solution they need
2202346 its not satisfactory from our point of view in terms of the timelines of redemption therefore clearly well pursue our complaint
2202347 theyre all very critical elements of the settlement and i think the framework of what regulators are looking for the future as well
2202348 strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americas farming communities
2202349 the idea that they have some bureaucratic definition that constitutes severe economic harm is really nonsense to me
2202350 they need to look at reality we got people that are hurting
2202351 i think this is the early stages of the destruction of the texas livestock industry
2202352 one of the biggest mistakes weve seen by the u s government in the last 20 years
2202353 you can know one thing im going to be standing up with them and keep fighting for them
2202354 im sure there are going to be challenges from other areas in the future
2202355 if we were not a more diversified economy today we would have done better
2202356 i dont see any sector other than information with a decline
2202357 were talking of growth in those sectors of less than 1 percent
2202358 id seriously doubt wed see these kind of numbers next year for houston
2202359 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2202360 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2202361 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2202362 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2202363 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2202364 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2202365 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2202366 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2202367 the disparity between an economy seat and a business seat is too great to be offset just by miles
2202368 we have many loyal customers and we hope they remain loyal

2202373 it is in good taste i say if you have it flaunt it
2202374 you are an athlete representing your country stick to what you do
2202375 should show just a little decency in respecting their rules
2202376 american society has become entrapped in this filthy market and it is destroying our families
2202377 leaves for another day the question of how and to whom the award should be distributed
2202378 abn amro integration looks ahead of schedule which gives them a bit of credibility back and capital looks a bit better
2202379 there is business getting done it doesnt feel like we are getting back to the good old days
2202380 we are now in a position where we will only consider the sale of assets where the valuations are attractive
2202381 at this point we believe that aig is too big and too complicated for anyone to fully understand and it should be broken up
2202382 our goal is straightforward to define aigs vision and determine the optimal portfolio of businesses based on where our true competitive advantages lie
2202383 firms that dont settle are going to be frowned upon by investors
2202384 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities
2202385 every day that its down we lose about 1 million barrels of oil that otherwise would be available to the global market
2202386 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2202387 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2202388 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2202389 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
2202390 the unified platform will provide clear signals to everybody there will be content of over 100 250 channels with clear signals all over the country
2202391 the joint venture between the two parties is a profitable one because dth and paid tv is quite different from what we use to have so majority of nigerians especially those in the rural areas will access all these channels
2202392 nigcomsat will operate from the up steam while digitch operates from the down stream nigeria is about to unleash its own culture on other continents in terms of broadcasting services this is a dream that has come to reality
2202393 one of the key issue is the commonality of decoders one decoder can access more than 100 250 tv stations for those villages that have not received signals they will start to receive it soon for broadcasters it will be cleaner signals but for paid tv they will use one decoder
2202394 we are starting with 9 states give us 18 months and we will cover the whole country we will re train the engineers we have at the state in broadcasting services we will also engage the service of over 30 engineers from nigeria
2202395 the solution based joint venture between nigcomsat and digitech takes cognisance of the fact that service of this magnitude will both be costly infrastructureally and elaborate in the real intention of all nigerian broadcasters to take advantage of this service
2202396 the intent of this joint venture is also to redress the long term damage to nigerian broadcasting environment created by years of technological dumping and inconsistent approach to signal and content distribution by practitioners
2202397 both nigcomsat and digitech have long recognized the importance of changing the lives of ordinary people by getting information to them getting information from them about them resulting in both organizations actively looking for ways of actualising this
2202398 appropriate instruments to ensure optimal conditions for the collection safekeeping dissemination and scientific exploitation of the ancient manuscripts
2202399 various kinds of writing materials and subjects are covered revealing a multifaceted past of sophisticated reading and writing in west africa and reflecting a tradition of prodigious intellectual production
2202400 islams abiding solid influence owed more to its cultural achievements than to the sword
2202401 thriving urban centred communities peopled by merchants by guilds of artisans and craftsmen by scholars by jurists by poets by writers
2202402 this is one of zimbabwes wonders alongside victoria falls and great zimbabwe
2202403 when i approached blomfield looking for work at his farm he gave me a boulder and asked me to make anything out of it it was a surprising task but i accepted and began to work it took me a few days to come up with my first stone sculpture
2202404 these people wanted a gambian artist to perform for them in sweden and i was eventually recommended that is how the trip came about i left the gambia and had my first stage performance in malmo
2202405 though only a few gambians attended due to other commitments as it was on weekends when most gambians are at work
2202406 the trip was really a fruitful one because it moved my music to another level also standing in front of thousands of people helped me a lot to develop my stage performances though i sang in the local language i made sure before or after singing i translated the message i wanted to put across or the piece the particular track talks about
2202407 i want all my fans to expect big things from me anytime am currently working on my second album which is to be released anytime
2202408 i know that my fans are really hungry for my new releases but let them be patient as i have new stuffs for them in the pipeline to be released very soon all i need is their support because its because of them am out singing so i really need their support
2202409 if you talk about big surprises in baltimore media this would be one of them
2202410 after years of sometimes being at odds with the paper its an astonishing thing
2202411 it strengthens the newspaper to have a broad spectrum of perspectives
2202412 a vibrant commentary page features a variety of voices weve often relied solely on the syndicated columnists to provide that mix when we have strong independent voices right here in baltimore
2202413 will create even more discussion and debate on the issues
2202414 hell have a wide license to tackle issues he wants to tackle there may even be some occasions when he will be critical of the newspaper
2202415 if what tim franklin is asking for is a conservative voice
2202416 our museums have moved from being old and outdated bastions representing past racist ideologies to being part of a new non racial non sexist society
2202417 our heritage sector is working in much more dynamic and creative ways in our new south african context yet learning and interacting with international trends and innovations
2202418 the seriousness with which we take our museums and heritage sector
2202419 many museums may seem to be inert beautiful old buildings holding the old silver of the ruling dynasties of the past and the art of the old masters
2202420 but there are other ways of conceiving of museums for they are in fact spaces of tremendous potential for democratic reflection and civic education they are spaces open for continuing change and interpretation of the past present and future
2202421 the libraries of timbuktu force us to think anew about the very notion of a library and an archive
2202422 not at all in the end they will have to sit on others laps
2202423 why do some students have preference some parents paid a week after the deadline yet their children will attend the party
2202424 i see this as discrimination they are being victimised and their dignity is affected
2202425 we are long past the colour issue a child for me is just a child there is no difference at all
2202426 in my 40 years i have known only two presidents two wars and two sanctions
2202427 it is always important to include songs and the ones we are using are carefully chosen
2202428 if its prey escapes it follows even to far away distances
2202429 it is sad that the whole country has recently been engulfed in political violence we all witnessed this
2202430 some of the artistes are doing extremely well while others have failed to live up to expectations others have completely left the arts to join other professions
2202431 i do not see the broadcasting policy changing forget it just forget it the space can only come after a new political dispensation in the country as it stands now artistes have to find ways to reach their targets
2202432 the little space we create for ourselves is being closed as police demand to edit our work the media is closed to us and now they want to close all the other open spaces
2202433 we have to find ways to market our products and we would like to involve the media in our marketing
2202434 during the liberation struggle i witnessed repression and now we are going back to those days when artists were forced to restrain to keep under
2202435 artistes speak against power and demand a change of governments
2202436 festivals are important in that artists can showcase some of the works which hardly get promoted in the mainstream media
2202437 the apple really doesnt fall far from the tree does it
2202438 we do not know whether this mechanism is active or what exactly it does
2202439 there is no exhibit in any museum in the world that has the entire timeline of ethiopias rich and newly discovered fossils now on display
2202440 who were instrumental in realizing this special millennium exhibit from its concept inception up to its installation
2202441 the discoveries have proved that ethiopia is indeed the origin of man kind
2202442 the remains of humans that first walked on planet earth
2202443 take a look if it has you boiling with rage too i think youll see my point
2202444 his death was supremely unemotional you got god shaking in rage there is no emotional component he was a rebel against god he was taught to be a rebel by his parents he came from a rebel country they brought this wrath upon his head and it sucks to be him and it sucks to be them
2202445 said the initiative would give the city time to craft measures to lure sit down restaurants serving healthier food to a part of the city that desperately wants more of them

2202449 weve received about two months of good rainfall in the region which has meant run off into the dam has been consistent and the levels have risen significantly
2202450 quickup dam only reached 37 per cent of capacity last year and with more rain on the way we are confident of a good start to summer this year
2202451 we commenced a trial for a couple of weeks in july which was successful and will commence operations later in august
2202452 there is no point in sending people to prison if they come out with the same or even bigger hurdles to face
2202453 by giving them the chance to improve their skills and job prospects while they are serving their sentences the state government gives offenders a greater chance of living a crime free life after their release
2202454 we are up to the planning stage preparing preliminary plans for the building
2202455 id received no prior warning and ive seen no reporting in the media about it
2202456 no one else i know in the motor industry knew it was coming either
2202457 if you think of all the mobile repairers car dealerships spray painters exhaust centres and so on theres got to be over 9 000 in perth alone
2202458 the government will rake in millions for information they already have
2202459 at the end of the day it is a vehicle which allows me to get to and from jobs i dont work inside it
2202460 i said i dont think youll be able stop the backyarder from taking my business and he said i dont think that will be much of your problem which contradicts their stance already
2202461 i think theyre grooming him to be the next starting safety for the chicago bears
2202462 it seems like hes starting to get more confident with the defensive calls weve been making you can see his athletic ability coming to the forefront ill be eager to see how he does this preseason
2202463 i know some people find that hard to believe but you cant play this game with any doubt and i have no doubt
2202464 im planning on playing the whole season now ive said that for all my career and it hasnt happened like that but ive been hurt before and i think when ive come out and played i dont think youve seen any drop off in my intensity or in the way that i play and its not going to be any different this year
2202465 just his goal line strength hes given us problems at the goal line by him having a nose for the end zone
2202466 and his breakaway speed i dont think anybody knows how extremely fast this man is i dont think anybody is going to catch him from behind hopefully that will bring us a lot of big plays this year
2202467 hes looked really good since he walked in the building as far as otas minicamps and in training camp hes looked good
2202468 i think were all anxious to see him when its live
2202469 there are injuries that happen on the team all the time so you have to cope with that and do your best
2202470 ive got to show the coaches what i can do in full contact
2202471 ive got to prove i can run outside the tackles inside the tackles all of that
2202472 we see this is the just the beginning of much bigger things to happen on the youth theatre scene however our organisation can now rightfully claim to be the de facto national educational youth theatre promoter after all the hard work that had gone into the tedious but very creatively stimulating process this despite the lots of negative criticism envy and professional jealousy from certain quarters in the fragmented and divided theatre fraternity in the country
2202473 actually i can write a play on just my experiences alone with the youth of the country and that of the 17 cities and towns i have been working in for the past three years yes there were hard times bad times nice times and even sad times but because of the inspiration from leaders and educational vision of namibian youth theatre i forged ahead
2202474 i think i have been honoured to be selected and allowed to work on this project that demanded the highest degree of integrity honesty discipline creativity and respect for raw writers and actors talents others would have given their left foot just to have been part of it
2202475 we achieved what was initially seen as mission impossible today i take off my hat to the leadership of far sightedness but at the same time express my disappointment about the lackluster attitude of educational authorities for not doing enough for theatre in our beloved country
2202476 people were given their money in normal white envelopes that do not even bear any official stamp there was also no place or form given to the recipients of the money to sign as a means of verifying that they indeed got the money
2202477 it makes us wonder whether such money is indeed accounted for is there someone on top cross checking if the money has really been spent for the right purpose how do they do it
2202478 artists especially those from walvis bay had to sleep on the floor in swakopmund where the expo took place during this cold winter month simply because there was apparently no means of transport for them to allow them to travel between the two towns
2202479 the games will be a success and make china better
2202480 everyone talks about his potential but how long do you keep talking about potential
2202481 jay has had the big flashy cars and needs some stability in his career he has moved about a lot but needs to settle down and play some football
2202482 ive seen the headlines and i want to prove people wrong by scoring goals consistently
2202483 i feel like im ready to settle down get my head down and do my talking on the pitch
2202484 we know he is a big strong quick player with some silky touches who can score goals but not as often as he should do
2202485 maybe hell find a home here at cardiff somewhere he can settle but we can only give him a stage the rest is up to him
2202486 i believe i have my strongest squad since i arrived here at cardiff three years ago
2202487 weve have good starts and good spells in season but have never had the depth to compete over a season
2202488 this year were more stable as a club weve strength in depth and we havent got to move people out to keep ourselves afloat
2202489 the championship gets harder every season because there are 17 or 18 clubs genuinely vying for the ultimate prize
2202490 but i feel if our squad perform to their potential we can be up there with the best of them
2202491 every club is pretty much the same in the championship this season except the six clubs in who are still getting parachute payments from the premier league they have an obvious financial advantage
2202492 its a very important game for us they really knock it around well they do things quick they can hurt you we need to be on our guard
2202493 i think it will be a great game hopefully well come out victors
2202494 i think the only players that probably wont be available are svetoslav todorov darren ambrose and izale mcleod who are all suffering from operations
2202495 charlton will be a huge test and its clear that if you switch off you are going to get heavily punished
2202496 the valley is a very tough place to go but in a way its perfect because we are going to be pushed to our maximum
2202497 this is a chance for earnie to put a disappointing two years behind him because he has gone backwards he knows my feelings on it
2202498 he knows there are under 21 strikers ready to jump over his head
2202499 he knows about the threat of the under 21 lads because we are looking to push ched evans and sam vokes up into the first team shortly
2202500 when i first became wales manager i only had john hartson bellamy and earnshaw up front but now theres competition
2202501 paul needed a bit of time to sort out his personal problems which we understood
2202502 now were pleased to have him back in the wales squad because he can play in a number of positions
2202503 and we felt that using a bellamy and parry partnership away from home with their pace would have been interesting due to the way we set up our team
2202504 whenever steve has been with us he has done very well
2202505 his attitude has been first class i cant fault him for wales
2202506 the centre back partnership is a big concern for me at the moment
2202507 wed like to get it done as soon as possible
2202508 but we have to let it play out and im anxious to see round one
2202509 running the offense making good decisions getting rid of the ball quickly being accurate all the things a quarterback needs to do
2202510 managing the game making the big plays when theyre there taking advantage of opportunities just playing good solid consistent football
2202511 its not that much of a problem because we know if the quarterbacks are making the right reads and if theyre throwing the ball where theyre supposed to
2202512 the ball may be thrown and people in the stands may see it hit the ground or go over a guys head and say it was a terrible pass but the receiver may not have been where hes supposed to be
2202513 its actually good because you get a chance to see whos going to maintain their composure and not get frustrated if there is a breakdown not get frustrated if somebody has a mental error or whatever and just say hey im going to stay focused
2202514 the rookie year is always the toughest because youre dealing not only with football being new but youre in a new place and youve got all these different things that are coming at you from different directions
2202515 the first game is tough for rookies because theyre going to be asked to do a lot
2202516 its probably going to be the most tired theyve ever been in their life every rookie has gone through it weve told them to be prepared to play a lot
2202517 this is when you find out who rises to the occasion when the lights are on and who goes into hiding
2202518 it happens every year some guys are great in practice but for some reason when its game time they dont perform and some people are the opposite they dont perform in practice but when its game time they perform if you ask anyone they want the gamers so this is an opportunity to see whos a gamer and whos not
2202519 up to now i am convinced that this is the best piece of fine work i have ever performed in
2202520 the sole broadcaster has no funds set aside to support actors even in the form of royalties
2202521 no payments have been made premieres were conducted we invited the governor of mashonaland east province cde ray kaukonde and a number of prominent businessmen we are hopeful that donations will come our way to support this initiative
2202522 we are trying to sell the film to foreign broadcasters hopefully from south africa and botswana because we need to cover production costs

2202530 we used to understand the biblical language better and our language was closer to it
2202531 now what can we do to keep up the continuity
2202532 they managed to tie the ancient language with the modern world in all its depth
2202533 from our point of view while this is a fallow seasonal period of the year now
2202534 china remains a very strong source of growth for commodities
2202535 in spite of the current risks we believe that the fundamentals of the mineral and metals markets have not changed remaining very robust
2202536 another sector beating performance and in line with our view that the market fears of cost inflation killing margins are overdone this reporting season
2202537 the stark revelations of the last few days have reminded us yet again that we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
2202538 we must therefore never relax our vigilance against these extremists
2202539 let me assure kenyans that this government will do everything possible to prevent us from ever again being attacked
2202540 i do not know why i survived i do not know what god wants me to do
2202541 reinforces the need to confront the terrorists to work with our allies to bring them to justice and to prevent such attacks from happening again
2202542 we see them as they were as the opening of a new twilight struggle between hope and fear peace and hatred freedom and tyranny a struggle that has now finally fully been joined
2202543 and on that day we saw in response from our diplomats and development workers our soldiers and our citizens our friends and our allies what is best in humankind and why we shared why our shared values will prevail
2202544 we are looking at big ticket items we would never normally get
2202545 its an honour for us to be dealing with patients and their families in these difficult times
2202546 we didnt set out to write the ultimate war history
2202547 the aim is for the readers to relate with the personalities and the issues that surrounded them
2202548 a lot of them were interested with the horse side and a lot of the girls wanted to ride with us
2202549 my mother is the reason im doing this and we attack it in a different way
2202550 the resulting delusions of being ecologically invulnerable beyond animality and outside nature leads to the failure to understand our ecological identities and dependencies on nature
2202551 resist and challenge the assumptions underlying our control and consumption extravaganza we so naively identify with the good civilised life and move to a sustainable form of human culture
2202552 in our future planning both organisations recognised the need to grow in size coverage and range of services to be sustainable
2202553 we recognised the need to provide an integrated range of services of excellence in regional rural and remote australia run by people who live and work in those communities
2202554 the new organisation and name integratedliving was important to signify a true merger and a new beginning

2202556 no action or inaction on the part of the medical staff contributed to the patients deaths
2202557 in 20 years i have never heard of so many deficiencies for one hospital they got hammered
2202558 they have a huge huge task in front of them
2202559 to be honest with you we all knew this would be the outcome four years ago
2202560 we knew she wouldnt just walk away weve been grieving for four years
2202561 contrary to blog speculation people did not photo shop vivienne marcheline smile one can only guess that she is smiling because her parents are angelina jolie and brad pitt
2202562 the convenient thing about grad school is that i have summers off
2202563 it sounded like fun and a nice break from school
2202564 getting used to that much wear and tear on my arms was difficult at first and having to portage wasnt easy
2202565 we were excited to be done with the saranac and whimsically decided to cross it we finished about midnight

2202567 its to do your best with the appropriate courtesy and etiquette you should never gloat when you win and even if you lose you feel thankful to your opponent for what you can learn from him

2202569 standing with people who didnt have a voice who didnt have a process in the vineyards that is thinking and reflecting our way to a position
2202570 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2202571 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2202572 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard
2202573 we find that theres really either open hostility or passive resistance to unions
2202574 the gap between general principles and practices at the local level
2202575 embarrass and harass the sisters to knuckle down into an agreement
2202576 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
2202577 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water
2202578 ill go ahead and take the state and national level i know some people on the city council here
2202579 turf or acceptable dry climate ground cover is allowed in the frontyard
2202580 what they fail to mention is that they charged the same 700 license fee for the linux based photoshop that they charge for the windows build the difference between existing competitive products and photoshop did not warrant the difference in costs photoshop did not provide 700 worth of advantages to justify the license cost
2202581 behes fans say that hes a nice guy and that the evolutionists are
2202582 behe exudes an arrogant contempt for the scientific community exemplified by his neglect of peer review
2202583 i find many of behes responses to his critics to be suspiciously misleading and i believe this provides a clue as to why he does not allow comments on his blog or participate in professional discussion of his proposals
2202584 hey guys give it up i just figgered the whole thing out

2202589 if you dont do anything if you didnt reattach or transfer some of them hed have difficulty pulling his foot up
2202590 what we want to try to do is give him a real good functioning foot that he can walk on
2202591 when youre trying to figure out what level youre going to end up with its important to try to preserve as much of the length as much of the normal foot as you can but at the same time you want to give him a really good foot that he can walk on
2202592 he has dealt with it his whole life its not something like a broken arm that heals and nobody can see
2202593 he just walked in and said its been a long time since ive seen you
2202594 i cant help but think it makes you maybe a little more understanding maybe to have gone through something like this
2202595 my entire life i really havent thought about being anything other than a doctor
2202596 i dont know if i wouldnt have had the accident if id have any interest in medicine at all
2202597 whenever you live through something like that you get an appreciation for the level of complexity and the level of effort and the level of care it really takes and i know if its impacted my life that much id love to be able to do something like for someone else
2202598 we noticed that we had such an influx of people from other parts of the south
2202599 we wanted to make it a little more accessible for people that are on the west coast or in the midwest houston is kind of a nice middle ground
2202600 when you look at the way the music industry is today and how much its struggling when you go to somewhere like houston the scene is still thriving
2202601 its definitely a great market for ozone because we have a similar independent mentality
2202602 expressed personal views and been outspoken about controversial topics in and outside of music
2202603 we wanted to add the trillest artist award and everybody was nominating pimp c
2202604 we just decided that instead of him being nominated with the show being in houston we would just create a category with his name we wanted to definitely remember him through the show
2202605 he wasnt somebody that was going to be politically correct sometimes you have to just respect people like that
2202606 it lets us know that we are really here and are being recognized for all the hard work we put in
2202607 i think its definitely a testament to if you start with an idea and work hard youre definitely able to achieve things you probably didnt think were possible
2202608 i think the bet awards needs some competition and i think that ozone is in a good position to do that
2202609 i wasnt really so much worried about who was acknowledging the magazine and who was acknowledging the show
2202610 we definitely came up in the ranks i just wanted to create something for my audience that i felt was lacking
2202611 any label anybody wants to put on them we say just go for it because getting attention to little tiny movies made for 10 thousand to 15 000 dollars is great
2202612 oh man i really dont know whats going on here

2202627 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2202628 i like when you focus on making movies you make movies and people go to see them
2202629 but theres this whole other industry thats been created which the world hasnt quite adjusted to or caught up to or figured out its the same thing with copyright and all kinds of other things where things are going around that im sure at some point will become more civilized im just waiting like brad pitt and angelina jolie ill go out and adopt twins if theyll pay me 14 million to do it

2202642 expressed personal views and been outspoken about controversial topics in and outside of music
2202643 as somebody who has family living overseas who myself have lived overseas for a time i would be able to i think the world would see me as a different kind of president somebody who could see the world through their eyes if i convened a meeting with muslim leaders around the world to discuss how they can align themselves in our battle against terrorism but also put our the relationship between the west and the islamic world on a more productive footing i do so with the credibility of somebody who actually lived in a muslim country for a number of years

2202660 the meeting was to send a message to reassure the four consortia that the government want a strong bid and for it metro north to go ahead
2202661 if we keep the four consortia interested we get the best price but as was always the case it has to come back to the cabinet for final sign off it was always envisaged that this would be the case

2202664 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2202665 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2202666 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2202669 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2202670 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2202671 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2202672 john edwards repeatedly lied during his presidential campaign about an extramarital affair with a novice filmmaker the former senator admitted to abc news today in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her edwards also denied he was the father of hunters baby girl frances quinn although the one time democratic presidential candidate said he has not taken a paternity test edwards said he knew he was not the father based on timing of the babys birth on february 27 2008 he said his affair ended too soon for him to have been the father

2202675 it the building proposal contains nothing contrary to the published conclusions of the blasket forum and the area plan debated worldwide the only persons to object are four individuals who clearly from their own evidence have vested interests in delaying or preventing the development
2202676 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2202677 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2202685 the most important development of the entire campaign this week
2202686 he was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine
2202687 john mccain can become an emblem for people about what is wrong with washington he released an ad this week about how washington is broken and how he will strive to fix it he didnt mention that he has been enmeshed in a broken washington culture for 26 years or that his campaign is run by the most powerful now former lobbyist in washington

2202708 demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools
2202709 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california home school their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
2202710 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2202711 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2202712 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2202713 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2202714 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2202715 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2202716 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2202717 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
2202718 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2202719 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2202720 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2202721 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2202722 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2202723 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2202724 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2202725 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2202726 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2202727 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2202728 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2202729 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2202730 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2202731 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2202732 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2202733 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2202734 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2202735 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2202736 we do not understand why and we do not understand what changed
2202737 people are just cruel this is bad karma for him
2202738 i think anderson cooper is an opinionated hypocritical idiot who should be an adult and keep his opinion to himself he is the last person to judge anyone when he and his own family have their own issues
2202739 you must go back downstairs and leave your bags with the cloakroom
2202740 overseeing the universitys programmatic and physical growth in the arts an initiative that will make the arts central to university life
2202741 the golf tournament business is primarily fueled by economic support
2202742 we did everything in our power to generate the sponsorship necessary to continue with the ginn tribute but given the current market and corresponding cuts in corporate spending it was an uphill battle
2202743 we also appreciate all of the fan support that the lpga received in charleston and from throughout south carolina and look forward to returning to the south carolina market in the future
2202744 we have seen a lot of neighbors who have called to complain about this
2202745 you end up having communities that are shipping their kids all over the place
2202746 its unfortunate that carmen chu didnt come to the school board with the resolution or at least show it to us before going to the supervisors
2202747 we as a society and as a city in particular have failed in that endeavor
2202748 i dont think san francisco parents for a number of reasons want real diversity in the classroom in any great measure im very disappointed but thats the reality
2202749 i do not feel really up to snuff in terms of entering into this arena right now
2202750 i hit some good shots on those holes and made birdie
2202751 after my third birdie the next four holes were pretty much into the wind right there and i was just trying to make par on those holes
2202752 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2202753 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2202754 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2202755 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2202756 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2202757 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2202758 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2202759 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2202760 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2202761 its premature to say what the aspiration goals and time horizons are going to be
2202762 i was standing near my cart when i heard a big explosion and i felt as if hell was in front of me
2202763 the next thing i knew i was in the hospital receiving treatment
2202764 the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the election law
2202765 the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2202766 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2202767 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2202768 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2202769 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2202770 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2202771 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2202772 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2202773 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2202774 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2202775 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2202776 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2202777 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2202778 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2202779 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2202780 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2202781 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2202782 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2202783 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2202784 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2202785 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2202786 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2202787 to refuse to come here would be to give in to hate and prejudice
2202788 the agenda of the gay caucus runs contrary to the pro family pro life agenda
2202789 i will find it difficult to endorse any candidate who seeks the gay caucus endorsement
2202790 for the 25 000 voters who get the caucus slate card they are not going to be on it
2202791 and there will probably be some conservative slate cards that will leave them off
2202792 this the first time in 14 years of filing over 35 reports that anyone has sought to complain to the commission
2202793 this does not diminish or take away from the fact that several mistakes were made by me
2202794 there is still a very strong contingent of hillary delegates in the texas delegation
2202795 there are still delegates that want her to be nominated and want to vote for her
2202796 i know that there have been a lot of questions on this subject senator barack obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2202797 quite frankly both candidates made it a historic year and created a change in the dynamic of campaigns that i think people will never forget
2202798 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2202799 this may be the sadder observation that it may not even be relevant
2202800 the way i read the law the new company that buys a contaminated property inherits the responsibility for cleaning it up
2202801 the first day you were before me i thought i made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything
2202802 i do understand that youre under pressure but i have to look at how the system should be run and perceived by the public
2202803 at the beginning of this case you were given every privilege that could be given to you with regard to travel
2202804 at that time i made it perfectly clear dont come back
2202805 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2202806 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2202807 we are trying work all this through with the democratic national committee and with the obama campaign
2202808 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2202809 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2202810 its important that her supporters have a voice in some way
2202811 she is a duly registered candidate who got a lot of votes and she is going to do what she wants to do
2202812 you dont have to be a delegate or party insider to witness this historic moment firsthand
2202813 to showcase the gains the party has made in the west
2202814 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2202815 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2202816 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2202817 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2202818 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2202819 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2202820 youve got to remember this guy has never even been out of the first round
2202821 if the fight does go on and he gets into deep water who knows how hes going to react when he gets tired when his hands start dropping
2202822 hes never even really been hit in a fight before ive dropped somebody in every one of my fights so well see how he reacts when he gets caught with a couple of shots
2202823 ive fought some of the best on the planet mark kerr tom erikson when everybody thought he was unbeatable so im not really looking at anything in lesnars skill set isnt really anything i havent seen before
2202824 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2202825 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2202826 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products

2202832 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2202833 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2202834 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2202843 i was in the dining room doing paperwork and having a cigarette
2202844 it was closed as a hotel at the time and was therefore my private home there were no guests i only had a friend staying
2202845 the officer came across as vicious and a person with attitude
2202846 the defendant returned from the kitchen with a cigarette which she continued to smoke in the bar area she confirmed it was a smoke free hotel but said it was her home and she was free to smoke
2202847 instead of enlisting only rich uncles to help bring in the cash from our community obama picked a much younger group and that younger group in turn thinks young desi celebs may be the way to bring in the cash for their candidate
2202848 i believe the way this model works is that a typical second generation voter will see that some of his her favourite brown celebrities support obama and will thus follow suit
2202849 we will not let singh is kinng run in any of the theater in punjab they film makers have made fun of sikhs in the movie how can they show a sikh who is a follower of guru dancing and romancing semi nude women in the film it is not acceptable to us they have portrayed a sikh as a comedian and have ridiculed the sikhs we cannot tolerate it
2202850 the protesters came very quietly but as soon as they started protesting we arrested them
2202851 it is wrong that the film ran into a controversy it is a nice movie and very well made
2202852 the performance of the indian athletes will spring a surprise at the olympics
2202853 i finally told him about a month before the election
2202854 but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2202855 its a provocative thing to get people to read our crime prevention information
2202856 when i bought it aussie she was swimming normally but six months later she was swimming about upside down weve had her checked out and shes in good health i suppose she just likes to see the world from that point of view
2202857 parents feel if they have air conditioners at home why should the child sweat
2202858 the parents are given a planned menu of what will be served to their children each month computers are used as a teaching aid
2202859 these schools offer so many facilities but the price is also high it comes to rs
2202860 in march 1926 the swaraj party decided to walk out in a body from the assembly and some members expected me to participate in the walk out on the ground that having been returned to the assembly on the swaraj party ticket i was bound by the mandate of the party at the risk of being misunderstood i declined to join the party in their action and for the first time established a convention that the speaker is above all party politics and therefore not bound to accept the mandate of the party to which he belonged before he was elevated to the chair
2202861 since the resolution of the lahore congress many friends are anxious to know how i propose to act on this occasion i am making this statement today to set at rest all speculation on the question and to re affirm and emphasise the principle that the president is above all parties and he would be unworthy of the confidence reposed in him if he were to allow his conduct to be influenced by any party in or outside this house i venture to think that this principle must and will hold good under any form of government in these circumstances i feel i would be nullifying and indeed destroying all the work it is claimed i have done during the last four years and more were i to tender my resignation in obedience to the mandate of the congress
2202862 to continue to serve the house and the country as best as i can from this chair for the present
2202863 violation of the party constitution and decisions of the party as well as any other action and behaviour unworthy of a member of the communist party shall constitute a breach of party discipline and is liable to disciplinary action
2202864 expulsion from the party is the severest of all disciplinary measures and this shall be applied with utmost caution deliberation and judgement
2202865 in exceptional circumstances party committees in their discretion may resort to summary procedure in expelling members for grave anti party activities
2202866 provision for summary expulsion in exceptional circumstances is meant for grave anti party activities that means only under extremely serious circumstances such as when a member is found to be a spy or enemy agent or when a members activities seriously compromise the partys position should it be invoked
2202867 to expel somnath chatterjee from the membership of the party with immediate effect
2202868 were still waiting on a vin number or license plate or some identification of the bus
2202869 igualas bus could be under angel tours with a lease agreement
2202870 very responsible bus operator who would not take shortcuts in required maintenance
2202871 they said no problem you can send somebody by to pick them up and then we get another call and its whoops we dont have them
2202872 there is apparently no court order authorizing destruction of the property or any record of what happened to the property
2202873 there does need to be a court order for the destruction of any property
2202874 if i go over to your house and spend the night there and leave my shoes can i expect my shoes to be there three years later
2202875 what is the police department going to do with a bunch of sex toys keep them

2202879 i just smiled and told the desk agent that it was gods favor
2202880 without victoria im boring without me victoria would be in prison
2202881 in purely statistical terms do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
2202882 did so thinking it was cleared for such use but as you have so subtly pointed out i was mistaken
2202883 then when did you decide to play the race card
2202884 dont you call race and get upset about me being loud
2202885 stop and think about it before you call someone a racist
2202886 they were protecting the passengers they were protecting the crew they were protecting the plane
2202887 this is nothing more than attempted extortion dressed up in a lawsuit
2202888 this is a case not necessarily about criminal responsibility but this is about civil responsibility
2202889 we have information that ms trozzo and the school had complaints about the coach and his behavior with boys
2202890 they failed to properly investigate those complaints and remedy them
2202891 it was terribly chaotic to have that many injured and dead at one scene said lt bob fair of the sherman police department
2202892 wed like somebody to come down and say poof this is what happened but unfortunately it is going to take awhile
2202893 he said he heard a boom and didnt know anything until he woke up and was pulled out a window by rescuers
2202894 it happened because of the condition of the bus or the tire or the road just like the apollo or challenger
2202895 our values are going up and our enrollments decreasing so its accelerating everything
2202896 this is an egregious invasion of peoples privacy but the history of privacy violations in the united states is that theres all kinds of smoke but very little enforcement of privacy laws
2202897 being used to review data as part of hchds ongoing compliance and monitoring process
2202898 very important to the district and needs to be found as soon as possible
2202899 however you choose to return them we will keep your name confidential unless you want to celebrate finding them which i am willing to do
2202900 i think some violations are so severe that you dont have any choice
2202901 we are not ruling out that the lock has been tampered with
2202902 they have gone above the ceiling to explore all possibilities
2202903 they havent found a snake and they havent found a breach
2202904 we concur with the findings of the reconstruction unit and agree with the decision of the harris county district attorneys office and the court to dismiss mr vieyras charges
2202905 he has a very big heart and a kind and gentle soul
2202906 hes been in a very difficult situation he has had a lot to deal with in reporting to bondsmen while trying to continue his life while out on bond for a serious offense now that this is over he will be seeking counseling
2202907 we wanted to send a message that this should not happen again the violation of first amendment rights and the false arrest
2202908 the battle is not over yet because of the appellate process
2202909 but im glad the jury sent a message to the community that if you oppress someones rights society will not stand for it
2202910 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2202911 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2202912 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2202913 a good and a positive step in the right direction
2202914 the biggest shiite threat to both the iraqi government and the u s led coalition
2202915 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement
2202916 we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2202917 there has been some dissent among militiamen when the news first broke about the momahidoun army
2202918 but what muqtada says always turns out at the end to be good
2202919 the coalition decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings
2202920 the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
2202921 if you ask the ordinary person what they are upset about in the country today is not the presence of the elected president
2202922 the incompetence and failure of his policies has thrown the country into the worst power shortage in its history and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2202923 to me it speaks of the importance of our relations with china
2202924 well continue to be candid that all people should be free to say what they think as worship as they choose
2202925 as a confidence building measure as a gesture of good will
2202926 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2202927 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2202928 there is no greater offense than a crime that goes unpunished and it is even more outrageous when the kidnappers the criminals are police officers or protected by police
2202929 ir adonde t vayas vivir d nde t vivas tu pueblo ser mi pueblo y tu dios ser mi dios d nde t mueras ah morir y
2202930 lo naco no se quita con liposucci n ni lo pendejo con maquillaje

2202932 ir adonde t vayas vivir d nde t vivas tu pueblo ser mi pueblo y tu dios ser mi dios d nde t mueras ah morir y
2202933 dont you want to check and see if what your pastor reads to you is really in the bible and not just being made up
2202934 the idea of smoke and mirrors tends to suggest suppression and the idea that you dont want people to know about who you really are but i think it was nice to have a bit of a smoke screen in a way
2202935 we want john edwards to take an independent dna test
2202936 we still believe he is the father of the child we believed their is a money trail that goes back to rielle hunter
2202937 had sexual contact with the 14 year old boy on at least 10 separate occasions and that during several of these encounters tara allison hodges also smoked marijuana with the boy
2202938 from the districts standpoint when we learned of the investigation we were shocked extremely upset
2202939 the sole effect of the artificial snow is on the tribes subjective spiritual experience
2202940 a government action that decreases the spirituality the fervor or the satisfaction with which a believer practices his religion is not what congress has labeled a substantial burden on the free exercise of religious freedom
2202941 in a nation that prides itself on religious freedom and rights for all it should be intolerable that it is good for everyone except native americans
2202942 what we have is generally a bunch of non natives becoming arbiters of indian religion which is not the role of the court
2202943 genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks
2202944 a lot of circumstantial evidence painting ivins as a schizophrenic psychopathic person it was very very compelling stuff its just weird stuff i pretty much have no doubt in my mind he did it now
2202945 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2202946 we can do what ever we want we have the power and you voters are to stupid to react
2202947 when you come in with a fighter jet at 500 to 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2202948 now you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2202949 if we can have an effect there where we can take people out thats a real plus in terms of saving american lives
2202950 our folks look at it as theyre in the fight theyre saving lives they dont feel too bad about that
2202951 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2202952 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2202953 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground
2202954 the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2202955 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2202956 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
2202957 youre not just voting for america youre voting for the world
2202958 i gotta take my shoes off you know what let me get these earrings off too
2202959 this dancing thing this rhythm thing this moving thing it comes from my ancestors i just cant seem to help myself
2202960 weve been doing a lot of sewing these past few months preparing for this show
2202961 you saw radiohead last night they were great but they didnt look like theyd done any sewing
2202962 we spun the cloth to make these things we churned some butter while we were at it
2202963 how you doin chicago ive never said that before in my life it feels good how you doin chicago
2202964 we have time to operate through this its important we not panic or lose confidence in our assets
2202965 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
2202966 signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts
2202967 we feel that we are such a major player in the aviation industry that we will have enough traffic to drive the sales
2202968 this was the necessary domino falling for all the other dominoes to fall
2202969 it provides cover to the other firms to be able to say to their boards of directors gee look what citigroup did
2202970 it gives you hope that it sends a message to other firms that they should do something before an attorney general comes after them
2202971 our most important focus continues to be on helping our clients
2202972 our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis
2202973 we are solving it by giving them the option of selling their positions to us
2202974 the parting of ways with pacific life was mutual and strategic
2202975 were currently very active in the marketplace and getting some very strong interest
2202976 to paraphrase mark twain the demise of blockbuster has been greatly exaggerated
2202977 at the height of the housing boom the home builders were increasingly relying on predatory and risky mortgage products in order to qualify customers for houses which were sold at what are now clearly inflated prices
2202978 none of the proceeds went to marvel or were used for marvels benefit
2202979 the trustees believe that it would be irresponsible for them to reject the 80 million settlement offer
2202980 defendants continue to deny any wrongdoing and wish to settle the action solely to avoid the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2202981 none of the proceeds went to marvel or were used for marvels benefit
2202982 toyota sought the reward of going after high profits in trucks now theyre facing the risk of having gone after a collapsing market
2202983 the financial results for the quarter were severe due to our rapidly changing business environment
2202984 i look at this as more of a speed bump in the road for toyota
2202985 though it will face challenges in mature markets like the u s and western europe theyll make up for it in emerging markets
2202986 they still get to be part of a market they hadnt been in and theyll be a big part of it when commercial buyers return
2202987 questions have arisen regarding the advisability of this matter and how it may be perceived
2202988 we wish to be sensitive to these concerns and responsive to them and have therefore decided to withdraw this request for retirement benefits altogether
2202989 they remember that their transactions need to hold up under the light of day
2202990 when taxpayer dollars are allocated behind closed doors there is a reason and usually its not a good one
2202991 were pleased that the mayor shares our perspective that these contracts dont pass the smell test
2202992 act in the departments interests when they may conflict with his own agenda
2202993 the dealers i talk to were shocked by the demand
2202994 i myself feel the severe condition of the economy the slowdown is becoming apparent
2202995 i think the bond market is showing global concern about the economic situation
2202996 if you want to go about committing slander and libel you can safely assume he would tell it to you in person if he was going to write it you had better have your facts and evidence together for the record he had much to say it was not a 17 minute
2202997 he still makes fun of me like he did when i was a little kid
2202998 he would pick me up and toss me in the chalk bucket and throw me in the foam pit but its fun to reminisce about old times and think wow were on an olympic team
2202999 is almost like my little brother i never would have imagined that two guys from the same club gym could end up on the same olympic team together but here we are
2203000 the world has given its love and trust to china and today china will give the world a big warm hug
2203001 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream comes true
2203002 beijing you are a host to the present and a gateway to the future
2203003 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
2203004 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
2203005 and then you wonder why the wind blows the way it does
2203006 one hundred fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia
2203007 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2203008 i must also tell you that georgian forces have downed two russian jet fighters over georgias territory
2203009 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2203010 i have a job to do im determined to do it and i will keep doing it
2203011 and i will lead the opposition through to the next election
2203012 i have a job to do im determined to do it and i will keep doing it news com au is not responsible for the content of external sites the nerve
2203013 if you leave me ill die you love me right
2203014 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2203015 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2203016 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2203017 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2203018 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2203019 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2203020 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2203021 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2203022 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 km h
2203023 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2203024 this is what mommy and daddy used to do all day long when we lived on the aircraft carrier
2203025 an international train from krakow to prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails in the area of the town of studenka
2203026 there are some dead but we do not have precise numbers because our people are devoting time to rescue those alive
2203027 all staff have been called to service and we have freed a number of beds to make room for the injured
2203028 an international train from krakow to prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails in the area of the town of studenka
2203029 its horrible its a disaster according to information to hand there are at least 10 dead she said
2203030 it probably hit part of a motorway bridge under construction which fell onto the track said the spokesman jan kucera
2203031 its horrible its a disaster according to information to hand there are at least 10 dead she said
2203032 im the only one that thinks he has a weird shaped nose
2203033 no i think he does too but i like it it fits him somehow
2203034 um hes right here he can hear you you know
2203035 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
2203036 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2203037 i wrote the book in response to people asking me what it was like to go from housewife to house speaker and for advice as to how young people especially women could balance family and career
2203038 as well i will bet the math is quite different then
2203039 to oil companies than do most other countries combined while they are using federal property just to clarify a few things it mentions in the article that exxon will pay more in taxes
2203040 as well i will bet the math is quite different then
2203041 one more thought sitting in mcdonalds this morning watching the chinese watch the torch relay on cctv while waving their
2203042 the israeli police intervened and we are assisting them with their investigation of the incident
2203043 increasing tension between peace groups and settlers who live in the central historic part of the town
2203044 the peace groups say theyre trying to show the negative impact of the israeli occupation on local palestinian residents
2203045 for the settlers hebron and its ancient sites is inherently jewish and is somewhere they have vowed to remain
2203046 sure just one more round of blinds and ill be there
2203047 l y e ce ster since this insider secret is only known to the british they are looking forward to having a mild mannered chuckle over their warm beers at the expense of all those mis guided foreign chaps
2203048 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2203049 an army that treats the shooting of a bound detainee from zero range as inappropriate conduct is disgracing the values it claims to hold
2203050 it is my duty as president of the jury to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months
2203051 i would like to apologise one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2203052 i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2203053 he will serve out the rest of his sentence at that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant
2203054 but he will be eligible for review by an administrative review board
2203055 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2203056 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
2203057 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
2203058 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2203059 after you have served your sentence i dont know what happens
2203060 i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2203061 hell still be retained as an enemy combatant after he serves his sentence
2203062 but as an enemy combatant he then becomes at that time eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether hes eligible for release or transfer
2203063 this sends a long shot across the bow to the political ideologues who hoped that the military would serve as their pawns
2203064 a vindication of the military not of the military commissions
2203065 if anything its a vindication of the system it proves that this system is very fair and impartial and capable of prosecuting war criminals
2203066 they chose to make this a test case for future cases to be tried in guantanamo but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2203067 the economic situation has been bad for a long time no food no money no jobs
2203068 now we need the military to organise a very very clear election
2203069 we earn most of our money from foreign tourists what will happen if they dont come here now
2203070 but when the situation is very very critical something has to be done
2203071 thats the case in mauritania in the name of democracy someone could squander the wealth of the government and see the country fall apart
2203072 we have to see if the agreement will set a timetable for pulling out us troops from iraq
2203073 when a deal is reached we will act accordingly resisting the occupation remains a legitimate right however we will not resist the occupation until the completion of the agreement
2203074 is going to transition in to a civilian movement dealing with religious social and cultural affairs
2203075 resisting the occupation will be the responsibility of a limited number of mehdi army members
2203076 they will be named secretly by religious leaders in the mehdi army
2203077 worrisome because the restructuring mirrors the structure of iranian sponsored hezbollah in lebanon
2203078 eu j servi p tria amada e todo mundo cobra minha luz
2203079 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers
2203080 a really exciting chance for a new blogger to make steady income
2203081 money magnet attract money or repel money need your opinions
2203082 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2203083 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2203084 paying attention to your credit is going to be paramount for people
2203085 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2203086 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2203087 while we expect that 2008 will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant in 2009
2203088 none of the plans that weve advanced contemplate access to any treasury line weve not asked them and they have not offered
2203089 i dont think its by any means inevitable that they will go insolvent but after the legislation we dont know what the capital will be
2203090 we are no longer investors in fannie mae and freddie mac
2203091 i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by
2203092 whether you think you can or whether you think you cant youre right
2203093 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
2203094 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
2203095 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is
2203096 the visionary lies to himself the liar only to others
2203097 war does not determine who is right only who is left
2203098 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008

2203101 be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
2203102 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2203103 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2203104 youd need an awful lot of growth or some awfully large spending cuts to close that gap
2203105 its time to restore balance and fairness to our economy so it works for all americans
2203106 with each policy weve laid out what well do and how well pay for it
2203107 but its a lot harder to do when you get down to specifics
2203108 the truth is no one really knows how much cost savings such moves can generate
2203109 those rates are gone for taxpayers making over 250 000 come 2011 unless congress restores them and congress is simply not going to do that
2203110 a bill thats less business friendly than the one that stalled in june would be even less viable
2203111 our second quarter results were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment
2203112 we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be
2203113 we are examining every business as well as the assumptions underlying how we do business in the markets where we have a presence
2203114 what would be important is to know is this an up to date and full reflection of what they know to be their exposures
2203115 severe rapid declines in fair values of certain residential mortgage backed securities and other structured securities in the second quarter
2203116 it looks like the new ceo took what i call a kitchen sink quarter
2203117 the thesis remains the same that these portfolios will ultimately be marked up
2203118 it could be they felt they could afford to use their credit cards in june because of the tax rebate checks
2203119 we will be watching the credit numbers in the next month or two to see if that is what they were doing
2203120 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
2203121 without the lifeline many fear the two government sponsored enterprises lacked the capital to absorb losses associated with further deterioration in the housing market
2203122 we have a responsibility to the taxpayer and to the overall financial system to thoroughly analyze and understand these authorities should circumstances ever warrant their use
2203123 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
2203124 the message is clear that tackling inflation is the number one priority
2203125 these hikes are a clear signal to the market to constrain growth of credit as well as to hike lending rates
2203126 the two pronged approach of the rbi to hike interest rates and simultaneously sterilize liquidity may be considered strong measures to meet the policy objectives
2203127 clearly inflation control remains the top priority and both crr and repo rate hikes seek to curb credit growth and correct the short term debt yield curve
2203128 however gdp growth will suffer as a consequence of this monetary tightening
2203129 the rbi believes that demand has not yet slowed down enough and monetary tightening to curb aggregate demand is still necessary the policy has focused on getting money supply growth under control which implies that credit growth will be brought down
2203130 we can now expect the hike of 50 bps in the repo rate to be passed on to borrowers impacting the profitability of the top 100 companies to the extent of 70 to 80 bps on average the key question is whether in order to achieve the inflation target this may curb growth beyond what is prudent
2203131 the 50 bps hike is the second successive one of that magnitude following the out of schedule hike last month and seems to have surprised even the realists
2203132 at a time when all indications point to significant tightening of liquidity and a visible pass through of higher interest rates to borrowers across the board perhaps a 25 bps hike would have been enough to convey the message and have the desired impact the larger than expected hike in the repo rate now raises concerns about whether the already moderating growth momentum will be affected even further
2203133 this is below 8 5 but compared to the drop in growth rates all over the world or our standards it will be a very very marginal moderation
2203134 this is a conservative estimate as the annual reports of another 500 odd firms are still not available these 500 firms had a cash balance of 36 billion in 2006 07
2203135 likely to affect growth with a one year lag i would say if we do not take stern measures now it is going to fuel inflationary expectations and disrupt the growth path and might even threaten stability
2203136 we are certainly not talking about 9 growth anymore but more in terms of 7 to 7 5
2203137 that is causing a lot of concern in many circles but then there are many countries that would love to have 7 to 7 5 growth rates it is quite possible that our system got a bit overheated over the past two to three years and then this oil shock came in so maybe a little bit of a restraint right now would be a wise move
2203138 we tend to say that as soon as you raise interest rates you are going to sacrifice growth but that is a very short term phenomenon
2203139 maybe for a quarter or two growth rates may come down because of the tightening but in the medium to long run stability and lack of inflation are probably the biggest insurers of sustained growth
2203140 voters tend to revolt when inflation exceeds their tolerance level which today is probably no more than 5
2203141 high inflation means that the congress led upa united progressive alliance government is in serious danger of losing the next general election
2203142 i think the step that the rbi has taken now is quite appropriate under the circumstances and rather inevitable
2203143 i understand that the political masters are more edgy because of the coming elections but even if the rbi had concerns about the political cycle it would still be the right decision to cool things down and make sure that inflation stays in single digits and then see how things work out
2203144 the root cause of inflation currently is the oil and commodity price rise
2203145 over the past few years demand in the economy has also gone up significantly
2203146 one of the reasons that the rbi has delayed raising interest rates is that the u s has been lowering them
2203147 for a long time the thought has been that if we raise interest rates and the differential between the u s and indian interest rates become too high it will attract a huge amount of capital inflows but capital inflows are probably not one of our big problems right now the global markets are not optimistic about anything and capital flows are mostly in the opposite direction rather than coming in so the threat of a huge wall of foreign money coming into the country has receded a bit in the short run at least
2203148 with an all out focus on taming inflation another rate increase can be expected towards the end of august
2203149 expect 75 bps crr and 50 bps repo rate hike by the rbi in the second half of 2008 09
2203150 given the broad based nature of inflation we expect double digit inflation to continue in the coming months with both the rbi and the ministry of finance on the same page on the inflation front we expect the rbi to maintain its tightening stance using a combination of repo and crr hikes
2203151 our internal analysis indicates that barring any further shocks particularly globally headline inflation for the next few months will be around current levels from the second half of the third quarter it will start moderating and by the fourth quarter we are confident we will bring it down to 7

2203155 management either seems unaware or unwilling to admit the full level of the companys exposure to risky assets
2203156 things are still deteriorating for aigs assets so its really hard to call a bottom at this point
2203157 our second quarter results were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment
2203158 these results do not reflect the earnings power and potential of aigs businesses and it is clear that we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be

2203167 by virtue of the theory of political correctness it is right now a fact that any number of ethnic groups are above investigation
2203168 i believe it should be obvious to those who currently support the notion of political correctness which by any other name is nothing more than censorship sans the vote that sooner or later someone or some entity is going to come knocking on their door to inform them that they too now fall under these prohibitions and something whatever it might be that they have always felt was beyond reproach is now included in the list of subjects proscribed from public discourse
2203169 there is a perfect and apocryphal parallel with the german jews who during the 1930s paid scant attention to the fact that some of their neighbors down the block were dragged away in the night by hitlers brownshirts at first blush how their neighbors were faring was not their concern but the day came when there was a knock at their door and they were the ones who were dragged away a chilling prospect certainly and for thinking people it should be a clear wake up call as well

2203246 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2203247 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2203248 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2203249 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2203250 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia

2203264 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2203265 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2203266 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2203267 the simplest explanation is that the hot trade has left the sector
2203268 the bulls are enduring a repositioning of money in the market and the pure speculative bets on the price have shifted away from being nearly universally bullish to bearish in a period of weeks
2203269 the commodity risk against risk play is coming off in a big way
2203270 oil might easily have gone to 200 or 250 but that would not have altered the fundamental fact that it was and remains unaffordable to many consumers and businesses
2203271 in my view oil would be properly priced at 70 90 per barrel and thats where i expect it to trade
2203272 the main driving force behind oils decline is the stronger dollar the dollar strengthens driving oil prices down that means a better balance of trade which adds strength to the dollar
2203273 never get caught in the trap of saying that a small dollar bounce is the reason for the oil price moving though because the dollar is still in a downtrending channel until that channel move is broken i dont see the dollar significantly impacting a supply demand story like the oil market
2203274 the dollar trade is certainly affecting the precious and industrial metals markets significantly today
2203275 a major retracement or correction in a long term secular bull market or the beginning of a bear market with energy leading the way down just as it began the bull market 10 years ago
2203276 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year
2203277 we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
2203278 i dont know which one is better they both feel really good
2203279 the first goal was to make the playoffs the second was to be the no 1 seed and our last was winning the state championship now our next goal is to go down to the northeast regional and see what we can do there
2203280 i remember one meeting we had and we said this is what we wanted to do
2203281 we knew we were a good ball club coming into the tournament i thought we had a great shot to get to this point
2203282 the next day they started and never stopped its been a grind
2203283 in the month of july i figured between traveling and everything we worked 42 hours a week its tough but its rewarding
2203284 but we were very vulnerable to counter attacks in the second half because we got tired
2203285 timmy welch will start game one brad monroe will start game two timmys as good a pitcher as ive seen
2203286 our goal every year is to win a state tournament
2203287 we do have a number of college players on our team and it seems to be a different guy for us every night its been happening that way all year
2203288 well go down there and hope to squeak out a win on thursday
2203289 anything we get at this point is really a bonus
2203290 they melted down a little bit and i just kept going under par
2203291 i just tried to stay solid for the whole round because of my score i was in the third to last group and didnt know how i stood against the leaders but i knew i was in the hunt and they would have to shoot a pretty good number
2203292 i play competitively in florida but when im back here im working and dont play that much
2203293 i do a lot of teaching as well i practice 10 to 15 minutes here and there just to keep my game sharp but i havent played too many competitive rounds so it was somewhat of a surprise to play like this
2203294 getting away and going to a different venue was nice
2203295 we have had a busy four weeks at abenaqui so it was nice to get away for a while
2203296 there are only 21 legion teams all of that talent is being funneled into the 21 legion teams in the state all the talent is used theres no more mediocrity no dead spots in the lineup
2203297 before the season the coach told me i wouldnt be playing much but i got more time than i expected i got to catch five games when the starting catcher was out of town i played first for two games second for a game and dh for a game
2203298 the pitching is a lot faster and the hitting is a lot better were graduating only three people so it will be tough again next year
2203299 we have college players and class l all state players on this team
2203300 how does anyone crack this lineup but fords versatility was invaluable to us this year hes is a great kid we love having team players like him
2203301 his eye was swollen shut and it was his left eye which is his lead eye he stayed in the dugout for seven or eight innings he refused to leave he wanted to stay and make sure we were going to win
2203302 that solidified his standing i didnt expect to see him for a couple of days but he showed up next day in uniform knowing he couldnt play that night
2203303 you could see the stitches from the ball where it hit him around his eye socket he couldnt play because his vision wasnt back he was a great teammate and helped wherever he was needed
2203304 at the beginning of the season i was having back problems so i sat like half the regular season i didnt play first base all that much because we already had the best first baseman trevor park so i mostly pitched
2203305 it was hard coming back from the injury so i had a few rocky starts but i felt like i did well
2203306 i got at least 30 or 40 at bats this season during playoffs it was double elimination and unfortunately we lost the first two games so i hope we do better next year
2203307 the level of play was different for me than playing high school
2203308 a lot of the kids are really good so that brought out the best in me to play my hardest
2203309 and the coaches were great they taught me a few things about my pitching that i should work on
2203310 the experience was great being able to play against players of the same level
2203311 but im upset that we didnt go any further than we did losing two straight in the playoffs but im really excited about next year and playing with the senior team
2203312 he came here as a reliever a two inning specialist but through hard work and with us helping him find the right form he became quite a pitcher he went through a lot of pain to get there
2203313 hes dedicated he wanted to be there and he listened
2203314 i guess it was a kind of a midlife thing
2203315 i did three triathlons last year and one this year i wanted to be in better shape in my 40s than i was in my 20s
2203316 each individual event can get boring but i like the challenge of three different activities
2203317 i swim a mile or two a week bike twice with one longer one about 30 miles on saturday and i run a couple of times a week four miles each time
2203318 i did my first one in marblehead in april last year
2203319 the swim was in a pool because in april the water is too cold it felt great to do that one i got addicted after the first one
2203320 now the more i do the more i try to figure out how to use my energy so i dont run out of gas
2203321 i did the sprint at the timberman at lake winnipesaukee last year but i was too late to enter this year
2203322 last year the wind was howling there were three to four foot swells it was like swimming in the ocean
2203323 i just wanted to see if i could finish an olympic length triathlon and still feel good and i did
2203324 is there a culture of compliance with the law or one of fraud and deception
2203325 i felt like i couldve gone faster but not knowing the course is tough but it all went well
2203326 i ran the race last year and it was 90 degrees so it was nice to come back and run in this weather
2203327 i like the course and its nice going downhill that last half mile of it
2203328 i hadnt run a 5k since last cross country season so its been a while
2203329 cory was running with me and he was telling me what was going on
2203330 i like the whole atmosphere around this race there are people at every corner cheering you on and there is a big barbecue after you cant beat it
2203331 training is going well but its just not time for racing yet
2203332 even though my season didnt go so well i still ran well at the beginning of the year now im just looking forward to the upcoming season
2203333 shes probably one of the most determined people ive ever met
2203334 i certainly wouldnt have been able to walk 14 years without his help
2203335 he is definitely the best orthopedic doctor hes so current in his field
2203336 the biggest thing is he totally understands the athletes mind he worked with me as if i was already an olympian
2203337 its fun working with high level athletes it gives you a tremendous about of gratitude
2203338 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2203339 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2203340 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2203341 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2203342 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2203343 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2203344 i hope i can play at the level that ive always played at
2203345 theres no guarantees there have never been any guarantees for me its football and anything can happen
2203346 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer
2203347 im not a traitor never will be its business its the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give i hope the jets fans see the same thing
2203348 i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy but i know how tough the city can be and i know how great it can be
2203349 it can be as good as you want to make it
2203350 shes probably one of the most determined people ive ever met
2203351 i certainly wouldnt have been able to walk 14 years without his help
2203352 he is definitely the best orthopaedic doctor hes so current in his field
2203353 the biggest thing is he totally understands the athletes mind he worked with me as if i was already an olympian
2203354 its fun working with high level athletes it gives you a tremendous about of gratitude
2203355 we only had two teammates for yesterday and today so we knew we were short handed
2203356 yesterdays break didnt work out but at the end of today the efforts were all worth it for the win and the champagne
2203357 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
2203358 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth it was unnecessary were a small knit group the fact that this was a brand new policy and we werent as aware of it as we should have been they should have had a rules meeting to make us more aware
2203359 we all went around the table a couple of times and said what we thought it ended with us not agreeing with it
2203360 all i was thinking about was that one stroke penalty and it could affect the outcome of the tournament that putt seemed to turn my focus a little bit
2203361 sometimes when you get down in golf its very difficult to rebound
2203362 and megan on the other hand while i was losing my focus she was gaining more focus
2203363 i wish wed been able to play 54 holes its kind of a bummer
2203364 i went out too fast i was trying to stay with the pack
2203365 she went down there and did the best she could do its very difficult when youre running against the best in north america it was exciting to see her compete at that level
2203366 none of us knew if it was going to be called off or not so we had to play as hard as we could we all were hoping it would be called off though because it was literally impossible to play the greens were completely under water
2203367 there was nothing the nhwga could do about it today
2203368 between the gusty winds and heavy rain it wasnt possible i dont think anybody would enjoy playing in that weather
2203369 em geral o segundo semestre sempre um pouquinho mais forte poss vel que a demanda ultrapasse os r 80 bilh es j temos recursos equacionados para os r 80 bilh es e vamos negociar recursos com o tesouro nacional ou captar mais para ultrapassarmos o teto
2203370 at the end of the day it is about how many smiles can you put on kids faces
2203371 this program demonstrates how much fun hockey is for those that would otherwise not experience it
2203372 this free camp happens because of the support of the rinks at exeter and its donation of free ice as well as support from bauer philbricks sports and the seacoast lightning girls hockey program it offers a way for large numbers of girls to try hockey build friendships and get introduced to the basic skills of the game
2203373 this is one of a number of fresh and exciting initiatives that the rinks at exeter is offering since bill and karen linehan re established operational control of the rink
2203374 i felt like i couldve gone faster but not knowing the course is tough but it all went well
2203375 i ran the race last year and it was 90 degrees so it was nice to come back and run in this weather
2203376 i like the course and its nice going downhill that last half mile of it
2203377 i hadnt run a 5k since last cross country season so its been a while
2203378 cory was running with me and he was telling me what was going on
2203379 i like the whole atmosphere around this race there are people at every corner cheering you on and there is a big barbecue after you cant beat it
2203380 training is going well but its just not time for racing yet
2203381 even though my season didnt go so well i still ran well at the beginning of the year now im just looking forward to the upcoming season
2203382 my goal is to be a head coach at the division i level
2203383 working under mike pressler has been an outstanding opportunity my role as the defensive and recruiting coordinator will certainly allow me to learn how to be successful at the highest level to prepare myself to make that move when the right opportunity comes along there is no question that the move to division i puts bryant mens lacrosse on the map nationally being a part of the transition that is happening right now is as good an opportunity a young coach could ask for combine that with working under arguably one of the most respected and accomplished coaches in the sport of lacrosse is an unreal opportunity
2203384 none of us knew if it was going to be called off or not so we had to play as hard as we could we all were hoping it would be called off though because it was literally impossible to play the greens were completely under water
2203385 there was nothing the nhwga could do about it today
2203386 between the gusty winds and heavy rain it wasnt possible i dont think anybody would enjoy playing in that weather
2203387 we wanted to paint a picture of the human trying to survive in an increasingly digital world
2203388 i hardly go into record shops any more i buy from itunes
2203389 owned the music yet the music was used without permission in a mary j blige release recording
2203390 we all used to smoke weed together in my cell
2203391 i think he saw me as a father figure and he confided in me
2203392 it sounded like a wild time and i think everybody who heard his story was pretty jealous
2203393 as a way of saying thank you to me for looking after him in prison he offered me the chance to write it
2203394 ive got a big family and it was like a nest egg for me when i came out
2203395 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2203396 thats not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or stewarts or andys
2203397 pat myers and i were best friends in high school and still are
2203398 pat and i talk two to three times a week nick who just took over at ohio state has been instrumental in me getting into coaching and i talk with him weekly i was in his wedding two summers ago if that helps to define how close we all are its nuts that three guys from little kennebunk have all made it to this level of division i athletics go figure
2203399 so much credit is owed to our high school coaches mine specifically being joe rafferty for football don hill and dustin black for hockey and charlie burch for lacrosse its very rare to see kids from one town who have experiences under these coaches to make it to the intercollegiate coaching level and there are a bunch more other than the myers brothers and myself it goes to show how good of a job they do preparing the student athletes for the next level and that is tough to come by these days which i have learned the past few years in the recruiting process they deserve a lot of credit for that and kennebunk is fortunate to have great coaches across the board in most sports
2203400 were confident that if it proves to be true the culture of our programs are solid these are isolated events based on individual decisions
2203401 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2203402 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2203403 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2203404 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2203405 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2203406 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2203407 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2203408 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2203409 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2203410 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
2203411 as for new hampshire we wanted to return open wheel racing to the new england market
2203412 with the substantial upgrades weve planned for that track and the opportunity for the irl to get a footprint in a top 10 market such as boston we thought the time was right for new englanders to again enjoy indycar as well as nascar however the irl made it clear that new hampshire was not in its business plans moving forward
2203413 im extremely disappointed for our fans who have given us very positive feedback about the possible return of indycar racing to new hampshire motor speedway
2203414 in fact in a recent poll on our web site nhms com nearly 80 percent of our fans said they wanted to see this exciting form of motorsports return thats a strong endorsement and i dont understand the decision not to include our facility on next years schedule
2203415 i think its a slap in the face to bruton smith our chairman and to our company who have both been very supportive of the indy racing league since its inception from a historical perspective bob bahre the former owner of new hampshire motor speedway was one of the first to agree to go with the indy racing league irl when they split from championship auto racing teams cart in 1995
2203416 i dont know which one is better they both feel really good
2203417 the first goal was to make the playoffs the second was to be the no 1 seed and our last was winning the state championship now our next goal is to go down to the northeast regional and see what we can do there
2203418 i remember one meeting we had and we said this is what we wanted to do
2203419 we knew we were a good ball club coming into the tournament i thought we had a great shot to get to this point
2203420 the next day they started and never stopped its been a grind
2203421 in the month of july i figured between traveling and everything we worked 42 hours a week its tough but its rewarding
2203422 none of us knew if it was going to be called off or not so we had to play as hard as we could we all were hoping it would be called off though because it was literally impossible to play the greens were completely under water
2203423 there was nothing the nhwga could do about it today
2203424 between the gusty winds and heavy rain it wasnt possible i dont think anybody would enjoy playing in that weather
2203425 out of all the races i have ever done this one was the nicest
2203426 temple has one of the best womens fencing teams in the nation
2203427 theyre coached by nikki franke a two time olympian ive thought about the olympics of course i love fencing and have such a fun time doing it if that takes me to the olympics id love to go but thats not why i fence
2203428 ive met so many amazing people and learned so much that translates out of the sport and into everyday life
2203429 its a part of my life i dont think will go away any time in the future i want to see what happens and see how college fencing goes
2203430 right now i have no plans except to enjoy myself and learn
2203431 santa called on the phone i told him i wanted fencing lessons he said i was too young and it was too dangerous i cried to my parents
2203432 nobody i knew fenced i never saw it on tv i have no idea why i wanted them but when i was 9 i got lessons
2203433 last year as 10 year olds these kids finished the season as state runner ups
2203434 even though we finished in the same position this year i thought the contrast in the level of play from last year to this year was not even close despite the fact that 10 of the 13 kids returned from last years team
2203435 next year all of the players will be eligible for the williamsport team
2203436 the competition will be tougher however i think the experience that these kids have gained over the past two seasons will contribute greatly to the teams success next year
2203437 i want to thank all of the parents and fans for their tremendous support they have provided us since the start of practices back on june 22nd
2203438 you get a small trophy for being the runner up i want to get my name on the big trophy
2203439 i think i missed six putts under four feet that really hurt me
2203440 i just hoped to hit the ball well and have fun
2203441 as a young guy it is a big honour for me to play at the opening ceremony and to represent a new generation of chinese people to the world
2203442 im part of a new generation in china enjoying a very different way of life from our parents we love american culture and classical music but we also have strong chinese traditions
2203443 i fell in love with music and never looked back
2203444 i prefer to live in new york because no matter who you are there you wont be mobbed in china now everybody knows me
2203445 marty brings a great deal of enthusiasm and energy to our program
2203446 she has a wonderful background in field hockey were looking forward to the continuation of the development in our program with significant participation a successful experience for our students and the opportunity to contend on the regional and state level
2203447 i havent been around field hockey for a while and i really miss it i think i can bring enthusiasm to the job im just excited to be around it again coaching lacrosse last year at wells got me back into it
2203448 a lot of my ability came from my high school coach linda boudette at saugus
2203449 if you look at my stats i didnt have a lot of points i was more defensive minded
2203450 i was not the most skilled player but i had desire and my coach brought that out i want to bring that out in my players and i want to see the girls have as much fun with it as i did
2203451 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2203452 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
2203453 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
2203454 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
2203455 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
2203456 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
2203457 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
2203458 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over
2203459 i think for the most part the locker room would have liked to see him back here but like i say once youre on another team
2203460 its only because of the dedication and commitment of all the volunteers in this event that it continues to grow
2203461 we are very excited with the results this year and are looking forward to next year
2203462 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
2203463 somebody should have told him im a f g rock star
2203464 today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you
2203465 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop
2203466 if you take that position you will end up taking this one
2203467 my mom is teaching you how to make cookies you dont know how to make cookies
2203468 que seja este o nosso destino amar viver e come ar cada dia juntos

2203471 my parents wanted resolution they were told by the agencies that they had no property rights on the federal lands they pursued this case so that this 60 year conflict between ranchers and agencies could be settled and future generations of ranchers would have the security of their property rights they succeeded
2203472 this decision is important to every american because it reaffirms our basic right to own property whether you live in a major u s city or rural america
2203473 we review de novo the district courts grant of summary judgment to schreiber summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
2203474 i would like to clarify my position on the article that appeared in the chronicle herald this week it was stated that i felt that people over the age of sixty were too old to be in politics that is not my position my statement was intended to apply only to greg kerr
2203475 one thousand ways you hope your breasts will never end up looking
2203476 i was coming home from kindergarten well they told me it was kindergarten i found out later i had been working at a factory for ten years its good for a kid to know how to make gloves
2203477 stuffed dear heads on walls are bad enough but its worse when they are wearing dark glasses and have streamers in their antlers because then you know they were enjoying themselves at a party when they were shot
2203478 estamos muy entusiasmados con el lanzamiento de la versi n de grand theft auto iv para pc

2203480 leo frank a northern jew was lynched in 1915 from
2203481 im playing nothing but toby keith trace adkins and charlie daniels on the way home tonight
2203482 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
2203483 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
2203484 my government blew through my doors and killed my dogs
2203485 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
2203486 were not in the habit of going to homes and shooting peoples dogs
2203487 if we were there would be a lot more dead dogs around the county
2203488 i understand they have a job to do but it didnt have to go like that
2203489 ive never done drugs in my life anyone who knows me knows that i am so adamantly opposed to them
2203490 you cant tell me the chief of police of a municipality wouldnt have been able to knock on the door of the mayor of that municipality gain his confidence and enter the residence
2203491 it would not have been a necessity to shoot and kill this mans dogs
2203492 theres nothing in the four corners of the warrant saying anything about the calvos being a threat to law enforcement
2203493 there is a possibility that it was not meant for the mayor
2203494 il francese con questa prof si riduce a una lunga serie di esercizi meccanici sia di grammatica che di analisi testuale
2203495 ma a cosa serve la grammatica ha chiesto achille la professoressa ha fatto un lungo sospiro tipo sono costretta a sorbirmi delle domande stupide e ha risposto serve a parlare e a scrivere bene sostenere davanti a degli adolescenti che sanno gi parlare e scrivere che questa lutilit della grammatica come dire a qualcuno che per fare bene la cacca e la pip bisogna leggersi la storia del water attraverso i secoli non ha senso io credo che la grammatica sia una via daccesso alla bellezza quando si fa grammatica si accede a unaltra dimensione della bellezza della lingua fare grammatica serve a sezionarla guardare com fatta vederla nuda in un certo senso ed una cosa meravigliosa perch pensiamo ma guarda che roba guarda com fatta bene quanto solida ingegnosa acuta
2203496 that bitch wants to charge me 27 cents who does she think she is
2203497 hey ma i picked these dandelions for you we better put em in water
2203498 hey ma i made this coaster at camp for you yes im sure its a coaster
2203499 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2203500 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2203501 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2203502 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
2203503 anchio so bene che il t non una bevanda qualunque quando diventa rituale rappresenta tutta la capacit di vedere la grandezza nelle piccole cose dove si trova la bellezza nelle grandi cose che come le altre sono destinate a morire oppure nelle piccole che senza nessuna pretesa sanno incastonare nellanimo una gemma di infinito il rituale del t quindi ha la straordinaria virt di aprire una breccia di serena armonia nellassurdit delle nostre vite
2203504 to put it more bluntly india just cant keep inventing locally when it comes to massive socio economic problems such as illiteracy the energy crunch wobbly infrastructure and its dismal healthcare system

2203509 nobody calls me lebowski you got the wrong guy im the dude man
2203510 why did i lose 8lbs the first week i started drinking a gallon of water per day
2203511 just a shake of the hips and people literally fall on their face trying to chase this guy down
2203512 i think the clincher here will be when you tell her you actually own bibles and simply just dont rent them girls tend to like a man of means
2203513 it is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves one is evil he is anger envy sorrow regret greed arrogance self pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false pride superiority and ego
2203514 the other is good he is joy peace love hope serenity humility kindness benevolence empathy generosity truth compassion and faith the same fight is going on inside you and inside every other person too

2203540 no action or inaction on the part of the medical staff contributed to the patients deaths
2203541 in 20 years i have never heard of so many deficiencies for one hospital they got hammered
2203542 they have a huge huge task in front of them
2203543 theyve always been on the right side of social justice
2203544 standing with people who didnt have a voice who didnt have a process in the vineyards that is thinking and reflecting our way to a position
2203545 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2203546 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2203547 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard
2203548 we find that theres really either open hostility or passive resistance to unions
2203549 the gap between general principles and practices at the local level
2203550 embarrass and harass the sisters to knuckle down into an agreement
2203551 theyre very tiny the size of a period on a typical printed page
2203552 we got a lot of comments like oh well we already know that the moon is dry weve known this for 20 years
2203553 its hard to imagine a scenario in which a giant impact melts completely the moon and at the same time allows it to hold onto its water
2203554 its obviously a very new result to say that the moon might have had a significant amount of water right after it formed
2203555 there is a chance that there might be some very old water of the type that they discuss in the paper
2203556 this is really the next generation of phones and we are confident we can take on the competition
2203557 we believe our users want a keyboard and that they are going to be very happy with the bold for business and personal use
2203558 we do not know whether this mechanism is active or what exactly it does
2203559 for all we know it could trigger world war iii or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes

2203566 given this poor performance we fear that the quality of patient care may suffer at anaheim memorial under phcs ownership
2203567 we think that anaheim memorial should stay a nonprofit hospital and serve the community
2203568 we are concerned the level of care will deteriorate if the hospital is bought
2203569 we plan to continue the legacy of outstanding medical care that anaheim memorial medical center is so well known for
2203570 we are aware anaheim general is correcting several safety issues and the attorney general is taking them into serious deliberation
2203571 comment on trouve une solution si on ne dialogue pas comment on essaie de se comprendre si on ne se parle pas

2203583 my mother says i do stuff no one else dares to try
2203584 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
2203585 this is an incentive for people to make the right dietary choices
2203586 all three of these policies are forms of second guessing consumers
2203587 if there was an overwhelming demand for conspicuous calorie counts then businesses would respond to that the fact that you dont see it indicates that they are not really clamoring to have that information thrust in their faces
2203588 our clients are pretty sophisticated they want to have this information
2203589 our food is pretty clean to begin with our nutritional analyses will prove to be very good
2203590 its not intuitive thats why we have to give people this information my hope is that it will help them change their food choices people are still going to eat out but hopefully they will make good choices

2203602 this regular use of mobile phones for entertainment does not imply that consumers will pay for it

2203604 censorship in china is a symptom of a surveillance state that has been technologically supported by western corporations for years

2203615 at the end of the day we all have wants and desires and fantasies
2203616 some may be deeper than others when youre in entertainment you have more freedom to express your sexuality and your fantasies political people are a bit different they often have to be a certain way and if theyre not in reality its more shocking

2203624 candlelight has been very successful working with bands that defy convention
2203625 their discography is filled with milestones their legacy undoubtably speaks for itself and were thrilled to be part of their future

2203633 if you look at the political landscape today you see leaders everywhere consciously building a story around themselves
2203634 it was based on churchills own slightly mystic view of the british as this island race
2203635 this view of britain that many were uncomfortable with nevertheless became a useful stylized picture in convincing the country to fight on when all appeared lost
2203636 it crept up on her it was an evolved narrative that she was ultimately quite comfortable with
2203637 universal mind control the dancers donned futuristic skin tight costumes and wore face paint the number was edgy hard hitting and very entertaining sadly i missed cat deeley announcing the name of the choreographer
2203638 love is hard work but its the best thing that youll ever work for
2203639 oh it was so cute you look adorable those costumes are beautiful
2203640 its this much between the pair of you for me i think youre both brilliant
2203641 i was expecting you to be good because that is russian street dancing

2203644 holy moley you were really moving those feet had no idea how the pull through the legs worked and thats aprt of the magic of dancing
2203645 the jive is one of the fastest and hardest dances
2203646 you dont have to be in love with someone to have good chemistry with them
2203647 taken it on lived it and fought for everything along the way
2203648 i could watch your solos all night the humor appeals to him just so wonderful at what you do a great entertainer is better than a great dancer
2203649 im going to cherish so many of the numbers youve done on this stage
2203650 i love the way you finish your moves i love the way you complete the task that the choreographer has given you
2203651 even when im hurting and dead almost i would rather be here dead than at home

2203655 well one things for sure mia did not hold back
2203656 who would have dreamt that wed have two untrained dancers in the final four
2203657 mia i didnt understand the routine it was a bit like the scottish olympic team
2203658 when people buy tickets they dont give a damn how tired you are absolutely no one would complain at that performance all four of you well done
2203659 im very happy to get a chance to return to the nhl with the flyers
2203660 a year ago going back down to the phantoms to be head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and to show that i could be a head coach now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too

2203664 whos that guy i havent seen him in a sewing room catfight
2203665 in recent years the churchs view towards gay and lesbian people has changed and church leaders now recognize that being gay is a biological characteristic
2203666 the items that we had planned to discuss all focus on education and on toning down some of the rhetoric nothing that we will be proposing requires any change in doctrine
2203667 we are concerned at the churchs decision to not attend the meeting on august 11 the deaths the homelessness and the grief that occur because of well intentioned but misguided practices are real and they must all stop now
2203668 this quarter we continued our solid financial and operational performance while making tangible progress that enhances our multi year growth outlook
2203669 our pipeline group secured two major new projects the ruby pipeline and the tgp line 300 expansion which increase our committed backlog to 8 billion a level that is more than two times larger than any time in our 80 year history in e amp p our peoples acquisition is delivering promising new drilling opportunities in the texas gulf coast and the arklatex including the haynesville shale in brazil our bia camarupim project is accelerating with first production now expected in the first quarter of 2009 and our pinauna project remains on schedule with first production expected in late 2009 in short the outlook for our businesses has never been better
2203670 with the benefit of the very strong commodity prices that we experienced during the quarter our pre hedge revenue was near our all time record further we are pleased that we have been able to keep our costs in check with the combination of our second quarter loe and g amp a expense having declined by 8 sequentially and 8 versus that in the prior years quarter
2203671 people of the room let down your guard i stand only for one purpose and that alone it is time it is time for me to flip the closed sign on my eyelids and shut this response factory down for the evening i go not as a person who has had their fill of daily breathtaking but a seeker of comfort and stability we can all take and give so much in life but these things i must find for my own but when i look back on this night and the moments we shared im at a loss for having to give it up and for memories but just because i wont remember doesnt mean that it wont always be nuzzled somewhere it my heart for all time
2203672 we put a little bit of roadster in everything we do
2203673 we drilled 52 new development wells and re fraced twelve more existing wells on our fuhrman mascho properties we now have four drilling rigs operating at the fuhrman mascho and are drilling our 386th new well since april 2005 in june we completed an equity offering which has allowed us to eliminate our long term debt bring in the fourth drilling rig at the fuhrman mascho close a 10 2 million acquisition in lea county new mexico and increase our 2008 capital expenditure budget to 248 million for the first six months operations excluding any acquisitions were cash flow positive with the increased budget we dont anticipate that to continue in the second half of 2008 as we accelerate the development of all our assets having as many as eight to ten drilling rigs operating and drilling approximately 200 new wells company wide we continue to pressure check existing abandoned well bores in preparation of the arrival of the new yates gas pipeline which is expected in the second quarter of 2009 right of ways are being secured and pipe has been ordered we continue to look at acquisition opportunities concentrating on those that complement our existing properties
2203674 the high commodity price environment and strong operational results of the second quarter lifted swift energy to record revenues earnings and cash flow from continuing operations activity levels remained high and important work was completed across all of our operating areas in our lake washington field weve experienced certain operational delays which have impacted our production plans for the remainder of this year due to these challenges we are lowering our full year 2008 production guidance to a range of 10 8 11 2 mmboe although this is disappointing in the short term we are confident that the work plans we have initiated will allow us to meet or exceed our strategic production growth targets for 2009
2203675 dear insufferable moron do you know how to use lexis nexis google how to read the english language
2203676 in fact casey was denied a speaking slot because he had refused to endorse the clinton gore ticket
2203677 bill clinton to speak at democratic convention speaking role offered by obama campaign to end tensions nbc reports
2203678 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2203679 his knowledge of and experience with many of our young players will be invaluable
2203680 any time you lose a guy with that experience its hard to replace
2203681 but if it happens im extremely happy and excited for murray i think he deserves another chance to be a head coach in the nhl
2203682 a year ago going back down to the phantoms as head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and show i could be a head coach
2203683 now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2203684 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing
2203685 obama created a situation where he cant and wont brag on whats good about democrats and all that leaves is the stuff that does him and democrats no good

2203713 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2203714 and could i mention that sen obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
2203715 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s
2203716 the production offset is likely to approach 800 000 barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to outer continental shelf output

2203730 a consistent line of decisions by this court in cases involving attempts to deny or restrict the right of suffrage has made this indelibly clear it has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote and to have their votes counted in mosley the court stated that it is as equally unquestionable that the right to have ones vote counted is as open to protection as the right to put a ballot in a box the right to vote can neither be denied outright nor destroyed by alteration of ballots nor diluted by ballot box stuffing as the court stated in classic obviously included within the right to choose secured by the constitution is the right of qualified voters within a state to cast their ballots and have them counted

2203804 this equivalent of typical acid rain reduced methane emissions from flooded paddies by up to 25 per cent
2203805 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
2203806 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
2203807 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
2203808 the data collected through this project will assist designers and engineers in developing more sophisticated assistive aids for individuals suffering from various neuromuscular diseases and musculoskeletal injuries
2203809 better orthotic technologies could ultimately help people suffering from this disease greatly enhance the quality of their life
2203810 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined the nature of the audience has only scarcely been investigated so far but it is clearly vital social identity theory holds that when people act as group members their world view changes
2203811 we will investigate what happens when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status
2203812 in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune rather than empathy
2203813 if you trip over in the street you feel very embarrassed of course people in your own group who witness this your friends or those close to you feel empathic embarrassment and try to alleviate the situation and make you feel better
2203814 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2203815 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
2203816 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2203817 its abundant oil and gas resources are now being put to work to accomplish what nuclear weapons and 50 years of the cold war were unable to

2203819 ryan was tebows main guy when you watch his highlight tape in high school he catches the ball and made some unbelievable runs when you catch the ball from tebow who everybody in the country is recruiting at the time you are going to get noticed
2203820 i will call him once or twice he is doing his own thing and i am doing mine
2203821 tebow was a great quarterback it was good for me
2203822 it got me ready for the next level he got all of our receivers ready the caliber of quarterback was second to none
2203823 im sitting on an airplane talking to a guy and he brought up that there was a guy who wanted to transfer from southern mississippi

2203827 we were having dinner in omaha the night before i left
2203828 frank called my parents then my parents told me at first i just laughed i couldnt believe it i just kind of had goose bumps at first it didnt really hit me until the training camp in stanford suddenly i was training for the relay and an individual event
2203829 theres just no question that every race every heat will be very fast
2203830 frank has these nicknames he brings up in practice i dont know how it happened but it stuck
2203831 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2203832 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2203833 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2203834 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2203835 you cant help wondering if hes been captured by some kind of drilling cult
2203836 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2203837 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2203838 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2203839 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment

2203842 what spitz did was the greatest olympic performance of all time
2203843 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
2203844 i would say that he has a great chance of doing it
2203845 maybe even a better chance than four years ago lets put it that way
2203846 ive had facial hair leading into a few of my events over the last year or so
2203847 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2203848 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2203849 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2203850 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2203851 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2203852 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2203853 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2203854 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country
2203855 i need to send the message as an athlete from sudan im worried about the kids who are dying in darfur
2203856 im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics as i was watching the sydney olympics
2203857 me coming here im here to compete for my country the olympics are supposed to bring people together to peacefully blend and im looking forward to that and stepping on the track and wearing my colors and representing my country
2203858 hes supposed to be here hes an olympian its supposed to tell people about the situation that happened
2203859 chinese people have been great putting all these things together its great being here
2203860 we hope that these beijing olympic games can enhance friendship between different countries and regions and enhance friendship between athletes
2203861 im very honored to be here and im very honored to lead the u s team into the stadium tonight im very excited
2203862 eventually time runs out if you dont start winning games
2203863 we have to finish strong hopefully we can play better
2203864 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
2203865 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2203866 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2203867 he is starting to get more and more confident and playing like he understands i love the way earl is playing
2203868 he is starting to find his way at that position
2203869 i got away with some pitches tonight but overall i thought i threw well
2203870 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
2203871 its real pleasing to see the progress hes made his last two starts
2203872 hes going to have his ups and downs but he was consistent tonight
2203873 once we got them on we were able to get them in
2203874 he got the barrel out front and hit the homer but it wasnt that bad a pitch
2203875 they got the lead to six nothing and its hard coming back the last two innings
2203876 i felt like our at bats were even better early on today
2203877 we hit some line drives at some infielders throughout the game
2203878 nobody likes to hear it because its dull but the reason you win or lose is darn near always the same pitching
2203879 there are some other teams out there with starting rotations that are good and plenty deep
2203880 but id put our guys whether its one two or one two three against anybody in the league
2203881 all i know is weve got a real good pitching staff this year starting with webby getting haren in an off season trade from oakland and the way randys been pitching lately
2203882 weve got them and other guys behind them that can take us somewhere pretty special
2203883 knowing youve got that in front of you it makes things so much easier for the rest of us
2203884 feeling like youve already got a lead before they even take the mound
2203885 and when we get to october hopefully knowing youve got to face those guys in four games and then you mix that in with randy and dougie doug davis its one hell of a good feeling
2203886 we are playing these games to win them all and the first half felt good
2203887 he looked smooth in the pocket and his footwork was good i was impressed
2203888 type a doesnt quite do it she might be triple a actually
2203889 were all waiting for about 15 minutes this morning for the van waiting for the men to roll out
2203890 i dont think its as sooty or dirty as it was when we were here a year ago
2203891 we might play on that attrition if its really humid thats good for us christine and the others can climb hard and fast
2203892 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have an eye aggravating me at the same time
2203893 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2203894 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2203895 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2203896 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2203897 i will sing and make music with all my soul
2203898 its a damn shame thats all there is to it
2203899 we know were missing out on a quality experience for the student athletes but its too big a load to bear
2203900 all the benefits inherent with the conference situation were not enough for us to forget about the travel costs
2203901 there is no room for divorce we cant get into priuses or onto buses and solve our problems
2203902 airlines dont have marketing people now so were dealing with some 800 number or getting some group desk
2203903 you hope to get a deal but its something that is never going away
2203904 we have coaches online just about every day trying to book flights at reasonable rates and theyre nowhere close to where they were before
2203905 its a guessing game you dont know whether to lock in a rate you just hope you get lucky
2203906 in sports where you wish to be competitive youre still going to have to find a way to do it
2203907 theres going to be more pressure on selling tickets more pressure on fundraising
2203908 i just want to go out there for those 40something year olds and show them age is just a number
2203909 ill still go to the closet and look for a certain shirt and realize that was pre katrina i dont have that anymore
2203910 we lived on the water and there were 440 homes two have been rebuilt my wife and i dont even like to go down there too many bad memories
2203911 but getting to the olympics was a dream that was unfulfilled the opening ceremony is going to be one of the greatest moments of my life
2203912 i remember very well how i did but besides that not much
2203913 most of my colleagues from then are already dead the only one still alive is me
2203914 it looks like my age makes me a little bit known to the people which is not too bad
2203915 i think so i hope so everybody says so i will continue to ride until my physical condition makes it impossible you never know you can get old something
2203916 ive been able to put the actual stadium in my mind
2203917 mainly what ive been doing for here is a lot of imagery me winning the games me winning the gold medal me being calm like how i want to feel here because your mind cant tell the difference between something thats visually imagined and something that actually happens
2203918 hes seen from a lot of different athletes what theyre going to do if theyre going to fall under pressure if theyre going to rise
2203919 if he sees something he needs to fix hell go ahead and fix it without you even really knowing it
2203920 hes an amazing athlete thats the cool part about the olympics not only do you get to play against the best you get to see these great amazing athletes you see only on tv to me thats the best part by far
2203921 weve kind of grown up in the farm system of usa basketball
2203922 for us to both be here means a lot to us were very close friends and this is an experience well have for our life
2203923 i consider her one of my closest friends i definitely enjoy being around her and have somebody that is familiar with everything i wouldnt want another person other than her to learn from
2203924 he brings added veteran leadership and playoff experience to our backcourt
2203925 a terrific ball handler with great passing ability and court vision
2203926 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2203927 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2203928 its not like were not running well because we are
2203929 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2203930 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good
2203931 and as we go through the preseason we will start a different quarterback in a different game
2203932 thats the plan right now were going to make sure that all of our guys have an opportunity to play with the first unit its an open competition for those guys and this will be the first opportunity for them
2203933 i think itll be a good test for our offense right now we just need to go out and compete i dont think it means anything weve got four quarterbacks here so you just go out and compete and see what happens
2203934 ryan had the big body and the team had a short yardage package in for him
2203935 the rest of us are going to have to step it up
2203936 the dod and the army lacked a coherent plan to translate the rapid narrow front attack on baghdad into strategic success soldiers and commanders at nearly every level did not know what was expected of them once saddam hussein was deposed and his military forces destroyed
2203937 evoked the aphorism if you dont know where you are going any road will get you there
2203938 did not see postwar iraq as his long term responsibility
2203939 franks message to the dod and the joint chiefs was you pay attention to the day after and ill pay attention to the day of
2203940 the transition to a new campaign was not well thought out
2203941 one could easily state that the u s army essentially reinvented itself during this 18 month period
2203942 those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2203943 over the long term we cannot kill or capture our way to victory
2203944 what the pentagon calls kinetic operations should be subordinate to measures to promote participation in government economic programs to spur development and efforts to address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
2203945 a widening rift between camps within the governing elite as well as popular support for compromise
2203946 there was a day when the passage of a u s warship offshore could change governments thats how much people feared the united states
2203947 today america has 150 000 troops in iraq and it is unable to provide security for iraqis or even for its own forces
2203948 the chance that the israeli government will attack the region again is almost nil
2203949 realize the importance of such an idea and are ready to receive the candidates and organize the event
2203950 while these issues are exactly the sort that ought to be dealt with seriously and comprehensively in the course of this campaign we think it preferable and most appropriate that they be discussed in front of an american audience
2203951 to address our energy needs and help alleviate one of the infrastructure bottlenecks of growth we intend to construct a hydro electric power plant at nyabarongo
2203952 the project will also enable us to replace the currently used diesel burning electricity generation with a cheaper alternative
2203953 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2203954 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2203955 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2203956 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2203957 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2203958 the 60 percent protective effect against hiv acquisition over the first 24 months of the study we now find to be sustained and possibly strengthened to approximately 65 percent over three and a half years of follow up
2203959 these results further support the addition of male circumcision to our limited armamentarium of hiv prevention
2203960 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective
2203961 it is the first time all of this has been brought together in this way
2203962 obese men are more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease
2203963 our assumption is that these men have more blood volume so psa gets diluted he said
2203964 by the time obese men get to elevated levels the cancer is more advanced
2203965 im not sure that we should check obese men more often
2203966 but we should have a higher psa index of suspicion of what is not normal 3 4 rather than 4 for really obese men 3 2
2203967 the prostate is a narrow thing to operate on and when there is a big wad of fat in your way if the abdominal wall is thick it becomes a technical issue
2203968 the only thing we can think of is that when you operate on obese people you have to be more careful
2203969 we cant forget that when we use the term we are not just talking about very large men
2203970 a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
2203971 we are not screening these obese men effectively and are not doing as good a job surgically as could be done
2203972 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2203973 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2203974 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2203975 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2203976 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2203977 generations of iraqis have gone to school learning how they rid themselves of british imperialism
2203978 they are the constituency to which maliki must bend you dont want to go down in history as the man who sold iraq back to the foreigners
2203979 to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of great britain
2203980 this statement baffled those iraqis who heard it did it mean that they were about to be independent did it mean that they were becoming a colony did it really mean anything no iraqis could tell
2203981 however well meaning the mandate was always regarded by iraqs statesmen as inconsistent with their national self respect and it was correspondingly unpopular
2203982 99 percent of what we were producing overseas nobody was reading
2203983 out in the field you can see one intelligence community the kids operate together analysts and collectors military and civilian
2203984 this is a dangerous world we dont fully understand and we need the tools of intelligence a page is about to turn
2203985 it changes the way we think and act about sustainable growth in california
2203986 get his paycheck and just pass it to arlene without thinking twice about what was coming in or going out
2203987 letters aug 7 obama has now proven himself by his frequent flip flops and inane comments to be a typical opportunist politician
2203988 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2203989 when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2203990 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute their readings
2203991 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2203992 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2203993 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2203994 he told me he wants to be eclectic in terms of who he hears from as he makes up his mind about economic issues
2203995 it is very embarrassing but this is the first i have heard of it they didnt even take a train to another terminal there was a bus waiting for them and they got straight on to it
2203996 we know that internationally you enter at terminal three but the chinese authorities classified our flight as a charter because we had 135 passengers in a 150 seater plane so we were diverted through to another terminal
2203997 we werent informed about the changes before takeoff so we were surprised not to see our project team at the airport
2203998 id like to have a baby on sept 9 2009
2203999 the tenure issue is probably going to be the determining factor
2204000 i dont want teachers going back to school with this concept hanging over their heads
2204001 were confident things will be resolved by the beginning of school
2204002 we believe that teachers really do see the advantages of this
2204003 they know what rights they do and dont have they really believe this is going to be in the best interests of students and teachers in the long run
2204004 the washington teachers union negotiations team is very aware that our members are extremely concerned about their seniority and tenure rights and will not reach a tentative agreement that is unfair and leaves members vulnerable to arbitrary terminations and no due process rights
2204005 we kept thinking that as long as we paid him the rent we would be all right
2204006 this last landlord he didnt even seem like the type who would do that to somebody but what is the type
2204007 early on the focus was all on the homeowners problems
2204008 its only now that the renters dilemma is bubbling up to the top
2204009 cannot be afraid of openly discussing the needs of religious communities
2204010 we were also aware of the subjective nature of how some supervisors have interpreted the countys comprehensive plan
2204011 we understood we were taking a risk but it was calculated
2204012 the racketeering charge has really been key to our attack on ms 13 because weve been able to charge a large number of members from the leadership down to the to the low level members
2204013 please dont ask me why the bear crossed the road
2204014 its kind of unique to see two atvs traveling along 301 in the middle of the night
2204015 at that time it was a traffic violation and the supervisor determined that it was appropriate to discontinue the chase
2204016 i think when things start to slow down people like to stick with what theyre comfortable with
2204017 a lot of the entry level buyers have just disappeared
2204018 were finding that if youre in the right price range there are a lot of families that are finding this is a really great neighborhood to move into
2204019 any other neighborhood where i like the home its 600 000 or 700 000
2204020 ill buy what i can a smaller home now while prices are low
2204021 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness
2204022 acting with an abundance of caution we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause we wish to express our sympathy to those taken ill and we are working diligently to correct the situation
2204023 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2204024 i am severing my relationships with the consultants in question and apologize for my part in the spectacle
2204025 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information
2204026 i had never heard of any of this before his previous supervisor had never heard of any of this before his current supervisor had never heard of any of this before
2204027 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and reevaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
2204028 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2204029 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2204030 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2204031 you dont have to be blind to see that the writing is on the wall
2204032 a child escapes from poland during world war ii and first heads to greece before coming of age in canada
2204033 me and my mother watched it it didnt really have an affect on me because i know what i can do and what im going through
2204034 it doesnt really change my mind at all i still like penn state and im still with it
2204035 im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option
2204036 i kind of moved on from tech and uva when i broke my offers down to five schools
2204037 the government has injected a lot of money in naads and now saccos are in place but you are here in town doing a lot of nothing instead of going to the villages where there is so much money
2204038 i advise you to go back to villages and dig lest you l die of poverty
2204039 if you think coming to town is an answer to your biting poverty then you are mistaken
2204040 when i saw the tree i just thought save my kids
2204041 the insulation started lifting off the roof and twirling in the air
2204042 it looked like the top part of a funnel in the clouds with a trail of debris behind it
2204043 if one is objective one would see china is enjoying human rights like never before
2204044 one world one dream building a better future for humanity
2204045 but politics and security trump economics especially during the olympics we just hope that after the olympics things will change
2204046 we were told to trust nobody we were warned that there is going to be a huge spy presence in beijing and that we should expect to be followed wherever we go
2204047 a gold mine for intelligence gathering blackmail and commercial secrets
2204048 no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
2204049 in order to ensure the smooth opening of the olympics in beijing it is required that your company install and run the security management system
2204050 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2204051 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in in older persons
2204052 was born an exhibition that tries to take the ideas and non visual observations of blind people as a source for discovering the invisible in us and all around us
2204053 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2204054 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2204055 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2204056 he was caught between two cars making it impossible for him to escape
2204057 he was just one of the nicest persons you could imagine dealing with
2204058 that guy was really interesting where was he all night
2204059 challenges in providing basic education in nigeria the role of private schools in adamawa state
2204060 in ensuring that children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic monitories have access to basic education we urged states in the federation to identify peculiar problems responsible for decline in public enrolment in schools with a view to addressing them properly
2204061 through 2 per cent consolidation revenue intervention as well as the provision of child friendly environment devoid of hardship that will encourage quality teaching and learning as is being pursed by the government through the commission in all states and local governments in the country which is aimed at ensuring that the nigerian child studies in a conducive environment
2204062 powerful online tool built exclusively for our supporters across the country to plan events to help spread john mccains message
2204063 hey i like that id use that in my house
2204064 i am a war affected person and iearn has made all the difference if i lose a hand i can only make it up if i learn to read and write carpentry electrical i cant do it it is better to come to iearn than to sit at home idle you can be a disabled but you can still do something positive in the community we have to link with these marginalized youth take them out of the streets and back into the community
2204065 staying at home or on the streets is not good outside can be offensive here we provide a family safety here there is a future for them amputees feel left behind ex child combatants feel left behind at iearn we are one there is no discrimination here
2204066 before i was on the street iearn helped a lot we find the kids on the street wandering victimized by the war we are all brothers and sisters no matter the condition there is still hope for them
2204067 getting computers is often not the big problem its the shipping costs
2204068 we want to make sure that those who want computers are serious some might say i want 10 computers when i only need two the fee is based on the quality and the speed of the computer
2204069 sustainability must be built into the recipient organizations funding for the provision of services must be secured before the donation
2204070 these children have very few choices in life especially practical needs we are engaged in helping youth live a better life not just with football but looking at the whole issue of youth poverty as a governance issue
2204071 donors are equally very eager to fund the establishments of these homes without consulting with the relevant ministry
2204072 financial and material poverty alone or conditions directly linked to such poverty should never be justification for removing a child from parental care or preventing his or her reintegration with the family but must be seen as a sign for the need to provide appropriate support to the families
2204073 we value their opinions and although the childrens petition was not used by council as the official reason for not approving the application but rather the objections from the adults it is great to see the kids exercising their rights
2204074 we believe we have the right to feel safe in our living environment with a shebeen around safety will be a major issue like drunken driving violence and indecent language
2204075 we also have a lot of toddlers around the neighbourhood who will be exposed to drunk and careless adults who can hurt rape or murder them as the norm these days
2204076 we also have the right not to be exposed to the temptation of what a shebeen will provide and present to us as impressionable teenagers
2204077 the objections raised by some neighbours were very serious and are consistent with problems experienced by many residents in neighbourhoods
2204078 youve got open space and youre putting buildings on it
2204079 an indoor pool i dont know how that would quite fit
2204080 frankly we think a lot of these kinds of facilities are very important to parkgoers and recreation users around the state
2204081 its a long standing practice our interpretation is that indoor facilities are supportive of outdoor recreation
2204082 there is some basis in law for the departments longstanding interpretation
2204083 there is a tension that has developed throughout the years
2204084 i think this is something the legislature should look at
2204085 in a world of six billion people it only takes one to change your life in actor and filmmaker tom mccarthys follow up to his award winning directorial debut the station agent richard jenkins six feet under stars as walter vale a disillusioned connecticut economics professor whose life is transformed by a chance encounter in new york city through new found connections with virtual strangers walter is awakened to a new world and a new life

2204087 im going to insult someone over the internet because i can
2204088 arent all firefox extensions open source technically like im pretty sure if you just find the extension as an xpi you just rename it to zip and all the files will be inside
2204089 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2204090 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2204091 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2204092 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2204093 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2204094 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2204095 i feel at peace with it i feel good about what my goals are because i have a lot of events it takes the pressure off me being focused on one chance to win a gold medal
2204096 going into each race its not ok if it doesnt happen here its not going to happen it allows me to be a lot more relaxed and take each race one at a time
2204097 there are strokes and distances that katie hasnt fully explored yet i suspect shell continue to evolve beyond beijing thats an exciting prospect for the u s team
2204098 shes mentally tough and physically ready theres no comparison to the swimmer of 2004
2204099 im prepared im in a different place now i know what to expect

2204102 one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
2204103 in 1969 i was the president of the student body at new mexico state university and the radicals were going to burn down the administration building as they had done across the country
2204104 i took it on myself to go out and stand on the wall where a guy was actually wrapping the crowd into an enthusiasm to go burn the building because at that time i felt like these extremists had hijacked our policies and they were controlling our universities and were finding the same thing today the extremists have hijacked our policies so that we cant live

2204107 i didnt realise at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
2204108 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2204109 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
2204110 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
2204111 1 test the waters first if you are nervous about going back to school or not sure what you really want to do start by taking a few classes first many colleges universities and online programs allow you to take individual courses without registering as a full time student compare evening classes to online and distance education programs to see which best matches your needs also use this time to consider why you are returning to school will it advance your career are you finishing a degree what kind of degree would be best for you talk with school counselors about your goals 2 schedule your time continuing to work while attending classes on nights and weekends is a popular choice for adult students many large companies have programs available that reimburse employees for tuition costs however these programs often require that you study something related to your work earn good grades and pay for the courses on your own before being reimbursed with attending a public university costing an average of 3 500 a year these conditions may be well worth the benefits you should also talk to your employer about adjusting your schedule in order to accommodate your classes you may want to come to work earlier so you have time to take courses after work make sure that your employer is supportive of your decision to return to school working full time and being a part time student may not actually be the best move depending upon your situation you should also consider being a full time student or cutting back to a part time job while you are in school it will be faster to earn your degree if you are enrolled as a full time student 3 apply for financial aid depending upon your financial situation you may be able to qualify for assistance through a free application for federal student aid fafsa its a good idea to fill out the fafsa form even if you dont think you will qualify for federal assistance this form is also used to determine federal student loan qualification and is used by other non governmental aid programs there are numerous financial aid programs and scholarships available specifically for adult students if you do not research your financial aid options you are passing up free money that could help you get an education you can search for available scholarships online at fastweb com 4 work out a system with the assistance of lenders a colleges financial counselors and financial planners you should be able to work out a way to affordably go back to school while it is best to pay for college without going into debt dont be afraid to apply for a federal student loan student loans have very low interest rates that make them an affordable way to borrow money also dont forget to investigate possible tax benefits related to going back to school once you have all your scholarships and loans in place it time to start being a student continue to communicate closely with the colleges financial counselors and other financial planners to ensure you are on the right track you should also keep a detailed monthly budget to help you balance your regular monthly expenses with your student costs after each semester take a few minutes to re evaluate your financial standing and discuss your situation with a financial counselor
2204112 enroll their children in a public full time day school or a legally qualified private full time day school
2204113 during our free time we write our ideas on how to resolve conflicts in our school and the community
2204114 reading and writing on the peace corner was the channel we exchange ideas on how to resolve conflicts
2204115 it is a lovely area and we are upset about this
2204116 can you believe two occurrences in days this is illegal and its damaging for a very precious resource we have wed like to get to the bottom of it and find the culprits this is outrageous
2204117 you would think it would be done under the cover of darkness but its a secluded community so it wouldnt have to be
2204118 the allegation must therefore be accepted as true and correct in so far as they are not implausible
2204119 why do we have national guard running from illegals on the border
2204120 window dressing to say we are doing something about border security
2204121 my real true honest concern here is that we dont return fire until we have been fired upon and by then we have probably lost a life
2204122 it mainly encompasses how to treat your captors what to think about when you are in that position and what to do when you are being rescued
2204123 i didnt think they were going to get that bold
2204124 its kind of been chilling that somebody is going to be that crazy
2204125 are not supposed to get into a firefight its not the sunni triangle
2204126 anyone down there enforcing the laws is going to be caught up in the violence
2204127 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
2204128 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
2204129 why do we have national guard running from illegals on the border
2204130 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
2204131 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
2204132 provide affordable accessible and portable health care to all those new mexico families and children
2204133 the issue of health care is too important to trust darren white and his election year flip flops
2204134 obviously were glad that darren white received quality care and is back on the campaign trail but we cant help but ask how about new mexicos working families should they be able to receive the same quality of care which position is it darren
2204135 if laziness is craziness then ive lost my marbles and i dont feel like trying to find them
2204136 oxfords bring back the 3 5 l v12 engines to f1
2204137 transcend traditional barriers and make art more accessible to children
2204138 he was in control and was sharp at times hell be fine and he knows better than anyone that we have to protect the ball
2204139 the market is in the right direction underpinned by a downturn in the oil price but there is still a lot of nervousness
2204140 we are broadly speaking at the end of the half yearly results season for the banks which have not been particularly good in terms of the actual numbers but they have at least exceeded expectations
2204141 while there may be a feeling that the worst is behind the banking sector any meaningful push upwards by investors will surely need to build on this weeks positivity to finally burst the 5 500 barrier
2204142 is a massive large car that should be completely helpless in an autocross and its not
2204143 the steering works the brakes work the powers massive the throttles controllable
2204144 but i did turn on the a c on the last run to take some power away you have to be careful with the throttle and not use it as an on off switch
2204145 theyre touchy and theres a lot of front bias so when youre on the brakes hard youre going nowhere but exactly straight
2204146 i think theres more lag with this supercharger than there is with the turbo in the evo
2204147 a spectacular car in every way its my vote for the best handling car in the test
2204148 not quite as neutral as the corvette but really close and it never gets into a situation where its pushing like crazy
2204149 tend to split and crack and getting beaten up a lot
2204150 we had an incredible crop of say 60 varieties of tomatoes
2204151 at that time nobody was growing that kind of variety so it really caught the eye of restaurants and lot of customers i was really lucky if wed had a dry year like this year in that first year because i had no irrigation i wouldnt be here id be back in brooklyn thinking of my next scheme
2204152 if you want to be a restaurant that counts you got to have some filthy farmer walking in with something just picked
2204153 i will tell my parishioners we dont know what happened but we are not the owners of our lives trinh said
2204154 god created everything we have to trust in god accept everything that he has given us and pray for the victims those who died went to heaven and god will watch those in the hospitals and help them
2204155 she was a very nice person said le of the friend shes cherished for 20 years
2204156 before she left on the trip she came to my house and brought me cupcakes le a post office employee said the congregation at 10610 kingspoint road is like a family to her it was established in 1986 and has grown over the years to serve 700 households the exterior is simple red brick with a vietnamese mural decorating both doors in the sanctuary a beautiful swath of green material serves as a backdrop to a life size statue of jesus our lady of lavang 12311 old foltin road was established in 1985 and has grown to serve 730 families the church is named after a church in vietnam where the virgin mary is said to have appeared the conventional building was replaced in 2001 with a structure with multitiered pagodalike red roofs the dragons perched on the edges of the roof and the 27 foot painted window of the lady of lavang are reminders of the homeland that many parishioners abandoned to begin new lives in the united states that journey is celebrated in missouri at marian days kim vu anchor and program manager for radio saigon houston 900 am attended the celebration seven years ago and described it as a religious event and family reunion the important thing is that its a way for people to express their thanks to the virgin mary
2204157 we mourn for their families and the spiritual communities from which they came dinardo wrote
2204158 we pray for the intercession of our mother mary that she may grant the families peace in knowing that their loved ones are now with her son jesus
2204159 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2204160 the stagnant air in beijing has helped pollutants accumulate i really hope in the next couple weeks well have conditions that will help us clear up the sky
2204161 for 14 years the model hasnt worked so its time for a change
2204162 in the last fiscal year they reached a milestone in that the theaters would operate without a general fund subsidy
2204163 my background is in retail and i always say if you have what the people want they will get there
2204164 the arts center has never been funded right give it more money
2204165 in relation to the company bedder 6 bbc worldwide decided to enter into a commercial arrangement to better exploit the commercial potential of top gear predominantly internationally
2204166 this benefits the licence fee payer in the long run and means increased revenues are being invested back into programme making
2204167 this is putting jeremy at the heart of it before he had no real involvement in the other things going on around around the top gear brand
2204168 this gives the business a p amp l profit and loss in its own right this is about pulling together the fragmented pieces to run it top gear as a single brand it is rare that the bbc has run a brand on an end to end basis like this
2204169 this is a car program there will be no cushions there will be no rag rolling no one will sing and at the end of the series no one will have a recording contract this is our new base and this is our purpose built test track there are no traffic jams here well apart from this one and no bus lanes either this is top gear
2204170 we cannot step back and let this president escape accountability
2204171 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2204172 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2204173 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2204174 it is important because it can give us complete information about the flora and fauna or the era
2204175 the bank will say that downside risks to growth have materialised but the report will not tip the balance either way as the outlook for inflation is very uncertain
2204176 take the project seriously because it is helping you acquire conflict resolution skills
2204177 the peace charity walk which includes sharing with our neighbours brothers and sisters the little that we have enhances unity
2204178 the monetary policy committee will likely stand pat for the remainder of the year as the tug of war between slower growth and mounting price pressures continues
2204179 we expect rates to be lowered next year as inflation comes off its peak and the economy struggles to find its feet
2204180 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us
2204181 womencount staked out a specific goal to stop the silence about sexism in the media and throughout our society indeed it is not enough simply to identify examples of gender bias the democratic party needs to create a system of accountability the platform draft does this and concludes the language with responsibility lies with us all well take it
2204182 the bank is likely to keep the refi rate at 4 25 percent well into 2009
2204183 we consider that there is some materialisation of the risks that we have identified
2204184 but they were identified so it is not a surprise
2204185 growth figures for mid 2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year
2204186 look through the volatility in quarter on quarter growth figures and monthly indicators
2204187 i stick to what i said we have no bias
2204188 the ecb would stay where it is for quite a while
2204189 very strong concern that price and wage setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second round effects
2204190 very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets
2204191 the question is not whether social conservatives will hold their noses and vote for mccain its will they knock on doors and plant yard signs
2204192 we dont have any faith that he will be consistent on the moral issues we really care about
2204193 putting gov huckabee on your ticket will immediately excite mobilize and activate a key grass roots constituency that is essential to your success
2204194 my fear is that there would be a lot of women and any number is too many who would say i think i will stay home
2204195 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2204196 a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes
2204197 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
2204198 right now is such a key time in the capitol with hundreds of bills passing through
2204199 the public should be able to trust that lawmakers place an emphasis on deciding public policy and finalizing a budget
2204200 hosted lunches on carts hosted drinks on the course and hosted caddy per foursome
2204201 the speakers going to be coming after us and the implication is if you dont support democrats itll affect your status in the house
2204202 youll get whoever youre going to get wherever you have it but theres a big contingency out there were talking about golfers theyll go back and work harder to convince their clients that they should attend
2204203 the bottom line is the election is in 2010 and ill make a decision at the beginning of the year
2204204 i think shell definitely think long and hard about it
2204205 rick has the unified support of the entire board to a person
2204206 we are absolutely convinced we have the right team under rick wagoners leadership to get us through these difficult times and to a brighter future
2204207 when i was a lad we used to get our bad cars from wartburg polski fiat british leyland and other leftwing dictatorships
2204208 most people will actually feel climate change delivered to them by the postman
2204209 twenty years ago if i had told the people of ilulissat that it would rain at christmas 2007 they would have just laughed at me today it is a reality
2204210 the accumulated experience of older people is not as valuable as before
2204211 where others saw nothing we saw food we was like we can eat right here so we swooped in with the vultures wisdom and brought this music
2204212 its over its done with hip hop is of no use
2204213 were going to take the precautionary step of returning the contributions solicited by mr
2204214 i see no appearance of impropriety or anything that would require that the contribution be returned
2204215 harry sargeant has been a strong advocate for republican principles and has done well for the party
2204216 never before have so many people been abandoned at once
2204217 it is inconceivable to think about losing 10 000 jobs in the first wave and the estimates run in the 30 000 range as the wave continues
2204218 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to avert it
2204219 sir promises and trusts are things that have been sadly suspect
2204220 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2204221 please give us a reason to once again believe in promises and trust
2204222 i cant look you in the eye and say were going to avert this
2204223 if youre not getting the picture you want youre not close enough
2204224 looks like managing on is pretty easy hopefully easier than the hoops makes you jump through to manage
2204225 if youre not getting the picture you want youre not close enough
2204226 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
2204227 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
2204228 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well that people say well lets just not reinsulate the roof
2204229 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
2204230 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
2204231 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
2204232 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
2204233 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
2204234 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
2204235 what they are doing in marburg is good and progressive and we and other cities need to move forward with similar initiatives as well
2204236 the market is in the right direction underpinned by a downturn in the oil price but there is still a lot of nervousness
2204237 we are broadly speaking at the end of the half yearly results season for the banks which have not been particularly good in terms of the actual numbers but they have at least exceeded expectations
2204238 while there may be a feeling that the worst is behind the banking sector any meaningful push upwards by investors will surely need to build on this weeks positivity to finally burst the 5 500 barrier
2204239 what this omalley administration has identified is that we have tremendous facilities around the state of maryland
2204240 people say they have these great facilities why are they not at these trade shows promoting their assets ive seen them there but not as a consistent presence like ive seen from other states
2204241 work well if a conference comes to town you could do receptions dinners and have a good overview of the park
2204242 anytime theres a new facility theres always excitement around it because it has the new amenities and the new bells and whistles
2204243 youre seeing a lot of states forming what would be statewide sports commissions
2204244 if you have seven cities in the state sending fragmented messages you dilute your message my sense is youll see more of an evolution toward aggregated groups
2204245 najaf is now more important than baghdad there everything deteriorated because of the violence here we have stability
2204246 all of this is being done by an iraqi company and another one from the united arab emirates
2204247 this year weve opened a clinic for heart catheterization and today we started work on a center for neurological sciences
2204248 why not let residents build like crazy here with a shiite led government in charge in baghdad
2204249 najaf is now number one in iraq in terms of reconstruction projects and economic power
2204250 itll take another decade for us to be number one in the middle east
2204251 the electricity is still bad and we only have it for two hours after six hours of blackouts yassen says
2204252 the drinking water is a problem too some neighborhoods in najaf get no water and others get contaminated water
2204253 we look for development for najaf but at the same development for diwaniyah for samawa for hilla
2204254 we have not to forget other governments in the same style saddam has done he has concentrated all his efforts on baghdad tikrit and mosul for example so we ought not to make the same mistake
2204255 just until i can save up some money to get another place
2204256 as a result of these market trends gmac is taking steps to reduce the volume of new lease originations in the u s
2204257 as part of our annual august model year clearance we are leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer our customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting
2204258 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2204259 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2204260 did i ever think this scenario would present itself no am i excited about the opportunity yes i am
2204261 i had a great career in green bay it goes without saying the things that have happened here this offseason the last few days in my opinion are over and done with i wish them well ill use their term were moving forward
2204262 they dont know me i think when they get to know me theyll like me and like the way i play and figure out that ill do whatever it takes to win for you
2204263 its difficult with chad because chad kind of came in the same time i did
2204264 we owe chad pennington a lot of gratitude for his dedication and his dogged team oriented persistence but today were here to talk about what were doing going forward
2204265 we thought we were getting good play at the quarterback position but we felt this was an opportunity to improve upon that
2204266 green bay is a small market but is there a bigger team
2204267 you know ive been in front of a lot of media ive been in big games won big games ive had my share of criticism im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things im here to help the jets win and thats why they got me the sooner i can get to that the better
2204268 i never will be its a business thats the way it works i gave everything i possibly could give while i was there in green bay and i dont think people would question that and i hope that jets fans see the same thing
2204269 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2204270 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2204271 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2204272 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer
2204273 but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team
2204274 we appreciate the tremendous passion shown by our fans we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change moving forward we are dedicated to delivering a successful 2008 season for all packers fans
2204275 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do
2204276 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2204277 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2204278 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2204279 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2204280 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2204281 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2204282 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2204283 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
2204284 if the currency fluctuation doesnt go in its favor its going to be in even deeper trouble
2204285 we are praying for the swift recovery of all the victims and our hearts go out to their loved ones
2204286 my goal from the very beginning was replacing the internal combustion engine just getting that off the streets
2204287 the environment surrounding our business has taken a sharp turn for the worse leading to a very tough first quarter
2204288 it will be crucial for us to act quickly and flexibly to overcome this
2204289 toyota kept its guidance unchanged by factoring in a weaker than expected yen and thereby masking the impact of a deteriorating sales outlook
2204290 excluding the forex factor honda is in a better state than toyota
2204291 i dont think these numbers are going to put much pressure on the stock price
2204292 the fact that theyve not revised down their full year estimates is a big point i think the first quarter numbers are within expectations and beat low end estimates
2204293 aku memahami ketidakupayaanmu dan menerimanya sebagaimana kamu memerima aku seadanya isteriku
2204294 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2204295 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2204296 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2204297 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer
2204298 but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team
2204299 we appreciate the tremendous passion shown by our fans we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change moving forward we are dedicated to delivering a successful 2008 season for all packers fans
2204300 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2204301 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2204302 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2204303 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2204304 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2204305 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2204306 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
2204307 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
2204308 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for the next hour im decompressing im getting re engaged into what its like to be a civilian
2204309 if we can have an effect there where we can take people out thats a real plus in terms of saving american lives
2204310 our folks look at it as theyre in the fight theyre saving lives they dont feel too bad about that
2204311 designed to ensure that each person who has access to sensitive materials meets the highest standards of reliability
2204312 this is devastating not only to usamriid but pretty much all government research
2204313 the implication is that usamriid cant be trusted to police itself
2204314 as these labs expand and there are more workers less experienced workers the possibility of internal sabotage and people with nefarious intent simply grows
2204315 we dont have that capability here nor do we have the scientists who know how to do that
2204316 i cant give credibility to others who say they would have had to have been in our program
2204317 they believed in this country and they were trusted for a long long time
2204318 it may look bad for usamriid because of this case
2204319 but at the same time usamriid was at the forefont of saving a lot of lives
2204320 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2204321 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2204322 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2204323 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2204324 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2204325 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2204326 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2204327 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2204328 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2204329 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2204330 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2204331 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2204332 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2204333 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
2204334 last year it was a very bad situation in baghdad but now it is good
2204335 still there are bombings but we must adapt to this
2204336 as a result of the georgian artillery shelling there are fatalities among the peacekeepers
2204337 one of them dropped two bombs close to the police station in kareli
2204338 most of south ossetias territory is liberated and is controlled by georgia
2204339 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
2204340 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2204341 were urging moscow to press south ossetias de facto leaders to stop firing were urging tbilisi to maintain restraint
2204342 we fully control our capital the battle is continuing on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2204343 georgian su 25 planes are dropping bombs on innocent civilians in the republic of south ossetia
2204344 an su 25 has also hit the ossetian village of kvernet and a convoy of humanitarian aid which was travelling on the zarsky road from russian province north ossetia to tskhinvali
2204345 when i was 16 years old i won the world championships
2204346 i set three world records at the same age i won seven out of seven international medals that year so that year pretty much got me the recognition that i needed with these guys here they all respect me as a shooter they all respect me as a person because they know im here and im dedicated to my job and my mission
2204347 thats what every competitors dream is to make it to the olympics
2204348 thats been a dream of mine since i was 12 years old but im only one step toward that dream now ive made the team but ive got to fulfill it and ive got to win the olympics
2204349 that really made me mad so i started training a lot harder and a lot harder
2204350 i know that if im perfect when im competing there then no one can beat me
2204351 the pressure is gonna be much more because you have so many millions of people watching you
2204352 were gonna have like 20 000 people in the stands back behind us which is way more than weve ever had before because we dont have that big of a crowd sometimes we have tv coverage when were overseas and stuff like that but never this amount of crowd
2204353 theres gonna be a lot of people watching and a lot of people pulling for me and a lot of people going against me too
2204354 but being able to compete against the best in the world and knowing that theyre there for the same reason i am to win the gold medal its just gonna be an amazing feeling im really ready for it im ready to go over there and show them what i can do
2204355 was found in dr ivins lab and no one elses
2204356 has to have a parent somewhere which means their assertion that it was only in ivins lab doesnt make sense
2204357 so concentrated and so consistent and so clean that i would assert that bruce could not have done that part
2204358 just because youre off your rocker doesnt mean you can make something that no one else in the world can make with the kind of equipment thats available
2204359 its hard to understand if there was all this negative information out there on bruce why wasnt it picked up in the biosurety program or by law enforcement
2204360 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2204361 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2204362 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2204363 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2204364 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2204365 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2204366 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
2204367 a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
2204368 descansaz en paz pues el error jam s se repetir
2204369 robot waterboarding became a way of exploring the issue without doing any harm
2204370 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2204371 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2204372 few sacrifice more to serve their country than all of you
2204373 i know that too often it seems like youre doing it all on your own
2204374 mostly im here to listen and to do a lot of learning and then to transfer that information into the heart and mind of my husband
2204375 i cant eat i cant sleep my pressure is up
2204376 i am blessed that is what most americans most military spouses are saying
2204377 sometimes things just still arent right we should be able to talk about that
2204378 my primary focus will be making sure my girls are whole and healthy
2204379 but once we deal with our readjustment period i want to be productive and engaged as much as possible
2204380 i can understand the challenges of feeling like youre doing it all and your spouse isnt right there all the time
2204381 my experience pales in comparison to anything theyre going through
2204382 lo peor vino cuando sacaron a un tipo en camilla tapado con una s bana y muy r pidamente pensamos que hab a muerto alguien
2204383 i say i will run the c vanderbilt untried as she is against any boat afloat to any place they name where there is sufficient water to float her for any sum from 1 000 to 100 000 this challenge is open until saturday next when i propose trying my boat c vanderbilt
2204384 este es un fen meno natural que aunque se produce muy a menudo s lo lo vemos si se dan unas condiciones climatol gicas favorables como es el caso de esta noche
2204385 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
2204386 we of course have to prepare our sentence recommendation consistent with what the jury found
2204387 history and world opinion will judge whether the government proved the system to be fair
2204388 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2204389 if we increase the pace of training we are going to need more
2204390 i hope they release us tonight so we can go home
2204391 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
2204392 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
2204393 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
2204394 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
2204395 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
2204396 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
2204397 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
2204398 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
2204399 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
2204400 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
2204401 the courts run by the government are active around the country
2204402 jesus came to take away your sins not your brain
2204403 its going to be hectic next week unfortunately but if people would try and avoid the area that would help
2204404 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2204405 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2204406 i got there and i guess no one really knew i was coming
2204407 clubhouse manager charlie samuels didnt really get much notice i guess i dont know if he got the word or late or whatever so i just found my locker put my uniform on and went out there
2204408 were calling him buck mays nickname and he doesnt know why yet
2204409 he said they were starting to get some letters and calls from people who didnt like the fact i was sporting willie mays number
2204410 so they just gave me no 39 but shoot it didnt matter to me what number i wore i could have worn 1 8th or 2 4 i would have been totally happy i just wanted to be there
2204411 that was back when nobody went from japan to the united states
2204412 i remember watching this kid play and thinking what a shame because this kid could play in the big leagues the only thing he couldnt do was throw obviously his arm has gotten a lot better but you could tell he was special at 18
2204413 for the jets to bring a big name and key addition at quarterback i think it brings a bit of hope to this city that there can be a chance for playoff contention and beyond
2204414 i think that excitement is translating to people supporting their teams
2204415 i think well be one of the first people to get them theres definitely high interest
2204416 i think even green bay fans might be buying them just because its brett favre
2204417 id be shocked if it isnt just because of the novelty
2204418 hes worn packers green and gold for so long it going to be unusual when hes not
2204419 los oasis son el mejor ejemplo de gesti n del agua nacieron en lugares ridos o semi ridos donde hab a alguna surgencia de agua en los que se organizaron huertos alrededor de palmeras y se instalaron norias y acequias que son el primer r gimen de administraci n de agua
2204420 el turismo es muy importante para asegurar la supervivencia de los oasis algunos de ellos que han registrado una masiva presencia de turistas y un gasto de agua sin control est n sufriendo sus consecuencias pero si se hace bien la gesti n puede ser crucial para la preservaci n de muchos
2204421 son ecosistemas perfectos sostenibles en s mismos por eso que promovamos su conservaci n y hayamos montado este segundo congreso en el que habr importantes avances
2204422 en un espacio forestal como el espa ol donde la combustibilidad del monte es elevada es imprescindible que nuestros bosques sean resistentes a los grandes incendios y para ello necesitamos m s inversi n en gesti n forestal sostenible
2204423 en 1995 otro gif asol 3 000 ha en los mismos pinares de zuera trece a os despu s el pulm n de zaragoza vuelve a ser pasto de las llamas por esta raz n necesitamos crear espacios forestales resistentes a los grandes incendios fomentando la gesti n forestal de nuestros montes con instrumentos como la certificaci n fsc

2204428 not only does it cause a visual eyesore it can have major impacts on the environment including spreading weed species and the leaching of harmful products into waterways and soils
2204429 other forms of illegal dumping that are not so well known include putting household rubbish in public litter bins leaving items on the verge and placing items in other peoples skip bins
2204430 a handy hint prior to purchasing is to ask yourself the following in relation to the item can i avoid or reduce my use of it
2204431 forcing a by election at the state level was a very big part of my deliberations over the past couple of weeks
2204432 in the end it is a consequence of the actions but i dont like it forcing the by election at the state level
2204433 this is an opportunity that i am excited about that i hope the community is also excited about what i am doing
2204434 there was a whole raft of issues that were involved in this decision in the end this decision was made just like most people would do and was based on gut feeling
2204435 i have tried to consider this from a whole lot of different angles including talking with family and trusted friends but in the end it was my decision and based on my gut feeling
2204436 hopefully there are a few people in town who might enjoy the opportunity to send the iemma government a message about the current status of state politics
2204437 i look forward to a challenging four weeks of campaigning
2204438 the oakeshott independent team recognises we will be outspent by other campaigns by at least 20 1 and we recognise the seat of lyne has been a national party owned seat since it was first formed
2204439 lyne is the greatest part of australia and ive been proud to call this area my home for more than 20 years
2204440 ive also been privileged to work with our community in a range of roles over that time and with our local state nationals team and former member for lyne mark vaile to make this an even better place to live work raise a family and retire
2204441 i dont want to see all the good work our community has achieved put at risk
2204442 im also deeply concerned that the rudd government promised so much prior to the last election but is simply not delivering
2204443 you only have to talk to people in this area to know that theyre hurting from skyrocketing petrol prices rising grocery prices interest rates and living costs
2204444 and now local jobs are at risk from the collapse in business and consumer confidence under the rudd and iemma labor governments
2204445 this isnt just annoying its an assault on capitalism companies with the best prices and the best products are supposed to win in our darwinian economic system instead sneaky charges and tack on fees prop up poorly performing companies instead of rewarding the best performers we are rewarding the members of the gotcha hall of shame

2204453 you could divide one side into three tv soundstages and film movies on the other you could do multiple shoots at the same time
2204454 even though its been bumpy these last few weeks with all the he said she said we do still respect him this community doesnt always embrace change real well and this is a change but i want the best for the green bay packers and i want the best for him
2204455 but we are not angry with the person that has taken them
2204456 the salvation army try to help as many people in the community and for something like this to happen has disappointed us greatly
2204457 if the person that has taken the amplifier would like to return it they can do so at the salvation army store in wauchope and no questions will be asked
2204458 questions have arisen regarding the advisability of this matter and how it may be perceived
2204459 we wish to be sensitive to these concerns and responsive to them and have therefore decided to withdraw this request for retirement benefits altogether
2204460 they remember that their transactions need to hold up under the light of day
2204461 when taxpayer dollars are allocated behind closed doors there is a reason and usually its not a good one
2204462 were pleased that the mayor shares our perspective that these contracts dont pass the smell test
2204463 act in the departments interests when they may conflict with his own agenda

2204465 and we just like to provide a safe environment where they can enjoy each others company and learn some things and give back to the community a little bit
2204466 its such a key time in peoples lives where theyre either moving forward in a good direction or starting to get lost a little bit
2204467 im not in the greatest of physical shape right now so im hoping to lose a couple pounds doing it
2204468 im also trying to make a point too that even a normal person whos not an athlete or an extraordinary specimen of some kind can do something a little strenuous a little hard and put your mind to it hopefully that will be encouraging to other people

2204471 were a shrinking church like all the mainline protestant churches are and we lost funding for our youth minister and one of the things that came out of
2204472 and the congregation even in spite of all these cutbacks weve had we believe we need to serve not only our children but our children in the community basically this is a challenge to the church
2204473 we expected that walking on a treadmill which is more controlled would be better than biking in terms of low impact to the knee

2204478 kick it straight through the middle of the ball and follow through
2204479 sometimes for them sitting and watching the players its a little detached

2204486 so theres your windfall profits tax in a nutshell reduced domestic production increased dependence on foreign oil and pump prices either unchanged best case or higher worst case
2204487 environmental consciousness tends to come from wealthier college educated people
2204488 but as terms like global warming dependence on foreign oil and carbon footprint become more common more and more consumers at all income levels will factor in the environment in their vehicle purchase decision
2204489 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2204490 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

2204495 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2204496 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2204497 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2204498 this is about the quality of life and public safety

2204515 red white and blue just make it do what it do for me and you
2204516 i knew in the back of my mind that i might not have enough time to summit because i was starting so late
2204517 then when my hands just wouldnt warm up i decided to turn back and try again the next day k2 is already the hardest mountain to climb in the world you dont need any added difficulties
2204518 someone had just died on the route i was attempting to climb
2204519 clearly the ropes werent fixed correctly and i wasnt going to risk that
2204520 i knew i had to get down to base camp before i could allow myself to worry

2204524 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2204525 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2204526 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2204527 i like when you focus on making movies you make movies and people go to see them
2204528 but theres this whole other industry thats been created which the world hasnt quite adjusted to or caught up to or figured out

2204535 were selling as many as 2 000 or 3 000 units per week today of blu ray devices and that basically builds our customer base and our loyalty because once someone buys the blu ray device we think were the best location for them to return and either rent or buy their blu ray products
2204536 we are seeing more momentum behind blu ray as hdtv penetration continues to grow
2204537 it should be a strong holiday for the format theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output

2204541 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
2204542 this is an incentive for people to make the right dietary choices
2204543 all three of these policies are forms of second guessing consumers
2204544 if there was an overwhelming demand for conspicuous calorie counts then businesses would respond to that the fact that you dont see it indicates that they are not really clamoring to have that information thrust in their faces
2204545 our clients are pretty sophisticated they want to have this information
2204546 our food is pretty clean to begin with our nutritional analyses will prove to be very good
2204547 its not intuitive thats why we have to give people this information my hope is that it will help them change their food choices people are still going to eat out but hopefully they will make good choices
2204548 you sweet thing you didnt have to go to all that effort i was going to finish that sentence myself honest
2204549 okaaay theres one answer dexter what were you going to say
2204550 since his playing days at uaa regg has built quite a resume he has a wealth of experience in coaching and recruiting and has paid his dues to move up the ladder to earn this opportunity
2204551 most importantly hes an alum with a great work ethic who understands the pride of being a seawolf he loves alaska which will help us attract more of the blue chip talent we have in this state
2204552 its very gratifying when you are able to bring one of your former athletes back as a coach particularly one who is as uniquely qualified for this position as reggie simon
2204553 i think his passion energy and past success will be a strong addition to our staff we are excited to get a person like regg and continue moving forward with our program
2204554 his strong ties to the mid west and ushl will help in our recruiting efforts in those regions
2204555 in my mind im coming home alaska is a place that is dear to my heart as are uaa and the hockey program
2204556 not many guys have the opportunity to go back and coach for the program they played for so its a special situation
2204557 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2204558 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2204559 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2204560 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2204561 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2204562 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2204563 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2204564 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2204565 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2204566 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2204567 its not that youre not ready is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with

2204584 i have a debt to bernie for so many reasons that i can never possibly repay
2204585 everyone was having a good time lindsay and sam were very comfortable with the group around you can tell theyre so in love
2204586 lindsay seemed to really fit in it seemed like everyone really likes her
2204587 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2204588 according to people close to the edwardses elizabeth edwards has secured a primetime speaking role at the democratic national convention john edwards as of this point does not and people close to him think he will beg off and not attend the convention so as not to distract obama
2204589 edwards had told associates he had been promised a prime time speaking role at the democratic national convention later this month
2204590 there should be a discussion about why this offer was made why it wasnt carefully researched at the time why it was necessary

2204594 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
2204595 no one works as hard as this man right here
2204596 did i ever think this scenario would present itself no
2204597 to a certain degree i really dont know what im getting into
2204598 and im talking about from a team standpoint what can i do in a short amount of time to get this team where we want to go and get myself ready
2204599 ive never been so excited to do a conditioning test in my life
2204600 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway any of those things
2204601 im here to help the jets win and thats why they got me the sooner we can get to that the better
2204602 my interest at first we all know was to stay within our own division
2204603 maybe that was a little bit of vindictive nature or competitive nature or whatever i think in the end that was probably the wrong motive

2204635 at its core this book is all about stripping away this overdoing that parents are doing
2204636 parents are under the assumption that talking is the key vehicle for influencing their children and producing change
2204637 the art of successful parenting and establishing a healthy balance of family power is more about what you do than what you say
2204638 making parents behavior the focus of discussions about the problems with rearing children today undermines parents confidence and obscures the social dimension of the problem
2204639 you are so worried about parenting that you are no longer focusing on your child
2204640 it is harder to run a household if children have that much power and authority
2204641 imperfect harmony how to stay married for the sake of your children and still be happy
2204642 once this book opens their eyes to this good parents just become better parents
2204643 they kind of know why they are doing this rather than relying on instincts
2204644 especially since its one week into august ive got some more games to pitch
2204645 but this team in particular in this ballpark thats pretty tough to do
2204646 hes just really been on a roll for us its all about location and changing speeds for moose hes been so consistent for us all year moose has been the leader of the staff
2204647 i dont know if every inning ended up with a guy on second or third but it seemed like it
2204648 i didnt have my best stuff today i just kept at it
2204649 i dont like going up there with guys in scoring position and michael young at the plate thats not a fun position to be in
2204650 its a big deal to get a split here it is
2204651 if we continue to play these close games and nail biters now it will prepare us for the end of september and into the playoffs these games can wear on you mentally it would be nice to go out there score early and often and coast to a win
2204652 if david wright goes down and they ask me to play third base what are you going to do can you expect the guy that fills in for david wright to be as good as david wright
2204653 arent we privileged to live in a time when everything is at stake and when our efforts make a difference in the eternal contest between light and shadow between togetherness and division between justice and exploitation o be joyful that you are a warrior in this great time will we rise to this battle if so we cannot lose for rising up to it is our victory if we represent love in the world you see we have already won

2204672 i dont think about that the music is my focus other opportunities that arise will always be a result of the quality and effect of the music im making
2204673 hip hop especially american hip hop has a strong ethos of keepin it real but i can take it anywhere and use different elements that relate to my experience and growth
2204674 i dont make a conscious effort to do something different but my music is an extension of who i am
2204675 i would not give up control to sign with a major label
2204676 i have friends who have done that and just became a tax write off
2204677 thats trying to get the approval of someone who doesnt make music they only approve whats already in the market
2204678 i want to travel to other countries on continents i havent seen to imbibe the vibes
2204679 i love what i do i have the perfect job to complement my music
2204680 some ghanaian tv stations always allow on their network foreign music videos with women at beaches wearing bikinis as well as movies that depict lovemaking however those of local artistes which are nowhere near the foreign ones are always denied airtime though they are paid for
2204681 not fair and could go a long way to kill local talents
2204682 for instance when we have beach scenes in our videos definitely we will still need someone to wear bikinis and not kaba and slit
2204683 took off my video with the argument over the way ladies in my video danced yet still they went ahead and showed international sexy videos of neyo and 50cent which even have worse things than mine
2204684 the media is not helping musicians the media is the problem we have to pay huge amounts before our videos or songs are aired they show these videos and we dont even get royalties back with those who pay us back too their monies are just like ice water money

2204689 his bubble hasnt burst but its leaking a little bit
2204690 it is not massive it is incremental but weve seen it across the board in all of these states that mr mccain is doing better among white voters especially white voters without college educations
2204691 he was absolutely shocked they were going after him like this
2204692 to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
2204693 she decided to get the peace order after an fbi agent working the case suggested it
2204694 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer
2204695 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
2204696 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
2204697 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
2204698 elitist is another word for arrogant which is another word for uppity that old calumny applied to blacks who stood up for themselves
2204699 casting obama as out of touch plays harmoniously with the traditional notion of blacks as others at the edge of the mainstream separate from the whole
2204700 any discussion of obamas skinniness and its impact on the typical american voter
2204701 cant avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race
2204702 barack obama is the first african american to win a major party nomination for president of the united states african americans are distinguishable from other americans by their skin color this physical attribute looms large in our nations history as a source of prejudice
2204703 when white people are invited to think about obamas physical appearance the principal attribute theyre likely to dwell on is his dark skin consequently any reference to obamas other physical attributes cant help coming off as a coy walk around the barn
2204704 quite surprised we looked at each other what should we do now
2204705 we decided to proceed to state senator pippys office two blocks down the street
2204706 as we left senator pippys office three 60 year old ladies and 45ish f
2204707 his reply once more was they did not have to let me in i said i thought he was giving more service to them than to me he replied if i felt threatened he would do the same to protect me as he was doing for them i asked if he felt i was a threat to anyone he smiled but did not answer
2204708 remember i did not give my name or any id this morning rep murphy himself called my home to see what happened i wonder where he got my name i will be going to the mt lebanon police station to review the report
2204709 i think murphys office owes us all an explanation democrat steve odonnell is running for that seat so if you live in western pennsylvania you might want to give him a call
2204710 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
2204711 and some of those tactics you mention the war in iraq are like that we use in the military
2204712 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
2204713 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
2204714 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
2204715 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
2204716 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
2204717 it was a decision i made on my experience and the information given to me

2204805 theyre not like greece which is able to slow down the game as they did during the world championships in their 06 upset of the americans
2204806 their goal realistically has to be nothing more than to make the final i remember they were so happy when the draw put them in the same group with the u s meaning they are likely to face the u s only in the final i think they are thinking of second place
2204807 but if manu is there they are going to be strong

2204824 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2204825 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2204834 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2204835 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2204958 emma carried the pain of her abuse for all her life until it ended recently
2204959 we really want to make sure that in her name and her memory something is done for other victims
2204960 i want them to set up a system that provides a life time help to victims that begs forgiveness to victims
2204961 an apology is not enough unless it is backed up with action unless he removes all obstacles to continuing support for victims
2204962 they have no authority to talk to society and tell them how to behave when their own church is unable to support their own victims
2204963 this draft is nothing but the councils attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state
2204964 we have observed that some of the people leading the violence are foreigners because they speak a different language and they do not understand our local languages
2204965 also the tactics they are using are not peculiar with zimbabweans because they are cutting out the tongue removing eyes and genital parts we are not sure where they come from
2204966 there are between six and 10 foreigners in each base and there are 20 zanu bases in the two constituencies
2204967 we were shocked to see chinese soldiers in their full military regalia and armed with pistols checking at the hotel
2204968 when they signed checking in forms they did not indicate the nature of the business that they are doing and even their addresses
2204969 the strategic leaks into the independent media of our plans by enemies within zanu pf has meant that the world knows everything we about to do hours before we do it

2204977 a lot of new people have noticed us since we moved to 580
2204978 we want to show the art world that bonhams the third largest auction house in the world is offering full service in new york
2204979 we have proved in the past that when we get the material we can sell a 2 6 million sargent or an 800 000 frieseke
2204980 we send our western material to california for sale where it does very well and california sends eastern american paintings to new york we compete for the estates with the other auction houses and now that we have a more visible space we hope to get more of them
2204981 collectors have to look everywhere they can find gems where they least expect them

2204986 this issue regards a former welsh assembly government employee who was dismissed for activities related to the glamorganshire blog that contravened the civil service code the case went to the civil service appeals board which we won and it is listed for employment tribunal in cardiff later this year
2204987 you must always act in a way that is professional and that deserves and retains the confidence of all those with whom you have dealings
2204988 you must not misuse your official position for example by using information acquired in the course of your official duties to further your private interests or those of others
2204989 this code is part of the contractual relationship between you and your employer it sets out the high standards of behaviour expected of you which follow from your position in public and national life as a civil servant you can take pride in living up to these values
2204990 the christopher glamorganshire blog was on my list of my favourites it seemed to me to be written in a sensible and rational manner
2204991 clearly if his contract of employment said he was not allowed to blog he doesnt have much of a case
2204992 but if it is simply a question of supposedly contravening the code i think sacking him is very harsh and heavy handed
2204993 this all smacks of the heavy hand of the state

2205000 what kept her going was the memories she had and being able to recall those memories so strongly

2205010 no one is being forced to return to zimbabwe from the united kingdom at this time
2205011 the current situation amounts to a policy of saying to zimbabweans we wont return you but our protection will amount to you being allowed to stay and beg on our streets
2205012 if the government had a shred of decency it would act now to give zimbabweans some temporary status in this country allowing them to work and indeed to reskill so that they are better placed to help rebuild their country when the mugabe regime falls

2205017 dear customer weve noticed your calls are short would you like to switch to per second
2205018 i started out in the mid nineties keeping the books for a local antiques dealer a woman who was completely neurotic another woman named sydney otto also worked there
2205019 we thought we could do well in the business if we did the complete opposite of what our boss did
2205020 quickly decided this was no way to make a living i was too cheap to change the business cards and too lazy to change the checking account
2205021 it was cheaper to go to school in britain than in the u s
2205022 i was floating around trying to find something that fit me
2205023 because of the shows weve gotten into weve been able to sell better things
2205024 at litchfield there are only four or five doing what we do so theres less competition
2205025 you end up lugging it to every show before you sell it
2205026 it has strong visual appeal and it can be appreciated without a lot of historical knowledge
2205027 i think theres a lot of folk art that competes successfully with contemporary art
2205028 we love trade signs and when we price one at eighteen hundred dollars people say whoa thats a lot but where are you going to get a painting that big at that price
2205029 before joe i didnt have anything to transport furniture in so i did smalls i loved cast iron especially cast iron doorstops
2205030 we buy what we can afford and what we can sell i do well with new collectors people will buy a bulldog bank for example because they say ive got a bulldog at litchfield last year we sold three banks to people for whom it was the first bank they ever bought
2205031 we like people who are furnishing their homes who have children
2205032 we have two different couples who come each year one from northern vermont the other from new york city
2205033 they save their money and each year buy one nice piece we sold a six thousand five hundred dollar grain painted dry sink to one couple last year
2205034 we have a real estate guy who buys one bank a year usually in december when his accountant says you have to spend some money
2205035 everybodys trying to be very careful people are asking us to take stuff to shows for them or to consign our things in their shop because they cant afford to buy new stuff
2205036 in the last couple of shows we saw some heavy buying on the part of a few dealers
2205037 we had two women in philadelphia one bought a game board the other a blue painted side table
2205038 the great thing about cricket is that even while your own team is falling apart
2205039 plan that was launched by the prime minister here in lewisham
2205040 i will tell my parishioners we dont know what happened but we are not the owners of our lives trinh said
2205041 god created everything we have to trust in god accept everything that he has given us and pray for the victims those who died went to heaven and god will watch those in the hospitals and help them
2205042 she was a very nice person said le of the friend shes cherished for 20 years
2205043 before she left on the trip she came to my house and brought me cupcakes le a post office employee said the congregation at 10610 kingspoint road is like a family to her it was established in 1986 and has grown over the years to serve 700 households the exterior is simple red brick with a vietnamese mural decorating both doors in the sanctuary a beautiful swath of green material serves as a backdrop to a life size statue of jesus our lady of lavang 12311 old foltin road was established in 1985 and has grown to serve 730 families the church is named after a church in vietnam where the virgin mary is said to have appeared the conventional building was replaced in 2001 with a structure with multitiered pagodalike red roofs the dragons perched on the edges of the roof and the 27 foot painted window of the lady of lavang are reminders of the homeland that many parishioners abandoned to begin new lives in the united states that journey is celebrated in missouri at marian days kim vu anchor and program manager for radio saigon houston 900 am attended the celebration seven years ago and described it as a religious event and family reunion the important thing is that its a way for people to express their thanks to the virgin mary
2205044 we mourn for their families and the spiritual communities from which they came dinardo wrote
2205045 we pray for the intercession of our mother mary that she may grant the families peace in knowing that their loved ones are now with her son jesus
2205046 pringles has a shape not found in nature being designed and manufactured for stacking and giving a pleasing and regular undulating appearance which permits comfortable eating
2205047 have affected the livelihoods of many in virginias key agricultural sectors and could lead to job losses
2205048 i am also concerned about the adverse effects the mandate is having on consumers
2205049 it is my hope that by temporarily lifting the ethanol mandate our poultry dairy and livestock producers will benefit from reduced feed prices and will pass those savings on to consumers
2205050 which do not compete with food and feed sources like corn
2205051 the goals of the rfs renewable fuel standard are meritorious and we believe in the need for greater energy independence however it appears that the rfs policy is having unintended consequences which requires renewed emphasis on the need to diversify ethanol feedstocks that do not compete with global food supplies
2205052 in light of these costs and the potential to do even greater harm to our economy both nationally and in virginia it is our strong belief that a temporary waiver to the rfs is both needed and appropriate

2205055 the recently completed equity financing strengthened our balance sheet and will enable us to further advance our seasonal influenza program through critical phase ii clinical studies and advance our discovery vaccine candidates into late preclinical studies
2205056 enterprise 2 0 into the social computing lexicon i thought i should at least ensure ive got a clear understanding about what this means
2205057 usually in the movies they say give me the money but they tried to kill us from the very start it happened really fast they ran in holding the knife out and started trying to chop me
2205058 we would never have used the gun if they werent so threatening
2205059 the scum gangs have got to learn and the police need to wake up they have invaded our rights we have to defend ourselves its logic its common sense
2205060 the safety of families should be paramount if families are resorting to vigilante type actions it begs the question why arent we doing more to protect them
2205061 treballa a la generalitat m s de 20 000 places de funcionari oblidat de tornar a buscar feina

2205064 it was a big mistake it wasnt my fault i pushed the girl in the chest area while she was grabbing for a glass in my hand
2205065 i realized it like a month ago so ive been excited about it since then
2205066 has been talking about her golden birthday since she could read a calendar
2205067 that we realized that this would be a pretty special day
2205068 the costs go down for the enterprise if the notebook is provided by the employee because the employee takes more responsibility fixing the computer i their own time
2205069 enterprises urged to pay staff to use their own kit

2205072 just because it is the budget doesnt mean we are going to spend every dollar
2205073 this was an extremely well thought out and efficient planning process were putting in what we need its not extravagant
2205074 we are going to borrow just what we need now and avoid paying interest on the rest for a year
2205075 i liked the stainless steel material he used i think that is very interesting
2205076 were not wholly against the ordinances at all and were certainly not trying to delay it
2205077 we just have concerns that the language now is overly harsh and provides too little latitude to property owners
2205078 theyre telling us that theyre not interested in revoking everyones license on the first call and that the language is there so that it has teeth
2205079 well we think they should either enforce it how its written or change the language to reflect what theyre telling us because folks are getting scared
2205080 if theres one bad tenant in a 100 unit complex and the owner loses his license do the good people in the other 99 units have to find a new home or will they only restrict the owners license to rent that one unit for a year
2205081 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2205082 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2205083 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources
2205084 if we cant manage to protect this kid she will be killed
2205085 our work with young victims would benefit from a constant policy to avoid the situation you just heard about
2205086 its unique to anybody who ever comes here theyre wowed by it
2205087 anytime you get a divergence of opinion at a community forum where people express their honest opinions its a good thing
2205088 the whole point of doing this is not for people to tell us what we want to hear its for them to tell us how they really feel
2205089 there has been a demonstrated need for a recreational facility in batavia for a long long time
2205090 different health clubs in the area have grown trying to respond to that need because batavia has not provided it
2205091 i responded that i would love a rec center and i would
2205092 if prices are favorable the fire department board of trustees will want to move forward immediately
2205093 weve known for a while that we need a satellite to better serve the high population in prestbury
2205094 we want a response time no longer than six minutes weve had some responses in those areas that took longer than six minutes
2205095 well have a geothermal system that takes cool air from underground during the summer and warm air during the winter well also have a cistern that will collect rain water off the roof to use for fighting fires and to wash the trucks
2205096 our position is that just because this evidence is not find able at this point does not necessarily mean it gets suppressed
2205097 we can prove its the same blood that was taken from scoliere and was the same blood that was tested we can show we have a tight chain of evidence up to the test
2205098 we dont even know necessarily that that is her blood
2205099 weve lost the opportunity to have our own experts evaluate the sample
2205100 of course our job is to make sure these things all can be prosecuted as successfully as possible
2205101 its just basically human error in my experience the more people involved in these chains of evidence the more opportunity you have for things to go wrong
2205102 critique our practices and suggest ways to improve the way we conduct our business
2205103 this is impressive and obviously there was a lot of community involvement
2205104 it is a unique project compared to what we have seen there are not a lot of memorial parks usually they are ball parks or concession stands
2205105 there was a lot of community involvement and community spirit in this memorial
2205106 to even get a site visit and knowing they took a look at our application and sent judges from southern illinois is enough for us
2205107 i have strong opinions on britains current situation amp i feel that in a time when public debate is being suppressed even something as trivial as a pop song can be a good thing shoot the dog is intended as a piece of political satire no more no less amp i hope that it will make people laugh amp dance amp then think
2205108 we had a few trees come down not many power issues
2205109 we were able to clean it up the next day and it was not nearly as bad as some other storms weve had before
2205110 most of the remaining outages dont affect large number of customers
2205111 the extra crews help us get to small pockets of customers
2205112 no we didnt have a van thats why we laughed the next day when we found out that they were saying it was a van
2205113 mr sarno says mr sarno mr salerno thats a slip there
2205114 i have not heard one bit of evidence that someone gave an order from the chicago outfit
2205115 one of the best things about it was we didnt have to drive we went with a group of about 10 in a limousine that left from the marklund campus in geneva
2205116 we had trouble getting volunteers last year so we outsourced the work and that cost us part of the proceeds
2205117 this year we started recruiting in february we have more knowledge now about making it work better
2205118 the surgery was successful and went well if not better than expected
2205119 but because of the severity of the injuries it will not be a quick turnaround in any event
2205120 were doing what we can to find out what happened to it it doesnt appear that there was anything done purposefully
2205121 we have our own issues with the blood but were adding the fact that they didnt preserve the evidence as a reason the blood should not be admissible at trial
2205122 in this case there are multiple issues with the blood draw not the least of which is it has gone missing
2205123 we had a really good dialogue but we were looking for a bigger turnout
2205124 whether the land would even be made available in the other plans is a drawback
2205125 i could be sitting here three or four years from now talking about a possible recreation center
2205126 thats why if and when this goes to referendum everyone will have their say on whether they think this is right for batavia or not
2205127 mmm i must contact the webmaster about ensuring ipsv terms are more accurately applied
2205128 this princess story is set in new orleans the setting of one of the most devastating tragedies to beset a black community and then they throw in the voodoo theme the fairy godmother character is a voodoo priestess and an alligator sidekick when you put new orleans alligators and voodoo together theres no beauty there
2205129 this book was not written but it evolved into radio free albemuth and valis the notes for the book as on this tape evolved into the exegesis
2205130 theres been lots of stuff out there about where i was coming to thursdays meeting or not i respect your schedule and if you cant meet at a certain time then we will work with you to make sure that your schedule is accommodated i do not appreciate what has been going on today as it relates to my schedule to suggest a 98 percent error rate regarding noah and drive this story to the point where it is today in my opinion is irresponsible if you want a team based environment we need to start acting like a team a team is a group of people working together thats a two way street
2205131 ok wir haben jetzt einen punkt erreicht an dem die dummheit und inkompetenz unserer politiker nicht mehr steigerungsf hig ist
2205132 when you forgive you love and when you love gods light shines on you
2205133 we pakken alsnog een klein stukje van de storm mee

2205137 all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood
2205138 marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman if activist judges insist on redefining marriage by court order the only alternative will be the constitutional process we must do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage
2205139 that is a factor that weighs heavily on my decisionmaking while the courts usually make that decision on mental retardation i still have a responsibility to look at all the factors that could lend themselves to a decision that someone may be mentally retarded to the point whether or not it would affect whether you stay an execution
2205140 whether its 7 0 or 4 3 the pressure is still there
2205141 it is a solemn no matter how heinous the crime a solemn responsibility ultimately its my responsibility while i listen to them while i take into consideration their vote ive never hidden behind their vote many times ive supported their recommendation and many times i have not
2205142 i am somewhat encouraged by the fact that science and technology have progressed to the point where it is less likely now to convict because of dna and other scientific methodologies have allowed us to clear innocent people
2205143 and weve got a whole procedure on the books now that pretty much provides for scientific review if there is any question so you can free innocent people or free innocent people from death row a lot more objectively
2205144 no matter how heinous the crime allowing an execution is a solemn responsibility
2205145 while i listen and take into consideration what they have to say their vote in and unto itself
2205146 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2205147 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2205148 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2205149 its not like were not running well because we are
2205150 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2205151 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2205152 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good
2205153 i know what it should feel like to go fast
2205154 were working way way too hard for these types of finishes
2205155 political masters tend to view these things in terms of their website being the one for every healthcare need thats wrong it should be generating new knowledge on a do once and use many times basis
2205156 employers need to decide for themselves what level of non work surfing is acceptable and then set out clear boundaries
2205157 productivity and morale can increase when firms trust staff to use the web sensibly
2205158 many companies understand the importance of the internet to personal and social lives and see reasonable use of the web at work as a morale booster indeed only 14 of firms restricted web access altogether
2205159 once i realized he was coming after me i went kick kick
2205160 i wasnt scared somehow he knocked me down he got my bag he got my money it was about 100
2205161 my kid jon he didnt have the reality of it in his head
2205162 he knows that i race cars and go 300 mph it was hard for him to understand that im mad at him for going 50 in a 35
2205163 he said imagine going to your best friends funeral and how that would make you feel
2205164 he told me the nights are long and you go through all this pain
2205165 first and foremost the goal of this unit is to educate
2205166 why we are not programming in objective c after all john carmack who shares the same initials as jesus christ
2205167 eu vou pegar uma onda todos os dias mesmo que seja na minha mente
2205168 would in effect bring the price of bread to where it was before governments zero vat tax
2205169 the price will definitely come down i can guarantee that as we speak our guys are working hard on sap computer systems and the prices will be corrected as soon as possible
2205170 perhaps it was just shelved at a different shelve where you fail to notice it
2205171 rural and agricultural development is crucial to combat national unemployment and poverty since the majority of people live in remote areas
2205172 these are the ongoing hikes in oil and natural gas prices high demand for fertiliser due to increased production for food and bio fuel and high demand for food across the world
2205173 we need to generate enthusiasm for farming among young people to ensure the future of farming
2205174 agriculture is at the heart of the zimbabwean economy accounting for close to as a fifth of gross domestic product and also critical for foreign currency generation and food self sufficiency
2205175 to ensure food security it is recommended that government should mobilise high performing farmers to grow maize on a contract basis
2205176 in this regard government could designate say 500 000 hectares for maize production under the contract farming scheme
2205177 the land reform programme and the agricultural mechanisation programme have actually opened up more space for tillage so it becomes imperative that seed farmers be contracted by government to ensure that all the space created by these programmes gets affordable and adequate seed
2205178 this way results from these two programmes will be meaningful and quick to realise
2205179 we wonder where all previous mps got their information which they relayed to cde mugabe
2205180 the planting season which usually starts in march was not blessed with rains in most parts of the region where some rains were received planting started soon after but in april the drought set in
2205181 ensure sustainable access availability and affordability of quality food to all nigerians and increase nigerias foreign exchange earnings as nigeria would become a significant net provider of food to the global community
2205182 make nigeria a significant net provider of food to the global community through private sector driven large scale commercial farming storage processing and market development
2205183 current global food crisis is an economic opportunity for developing countries especially nigeria
2205184 nigerias highly diversified agro ecological condition which makes the production of a wide range of agricultural products possible
2205185 is estimated that about 75 per cent 68 million ha of the total land area has potential for agricultural activities with about 33 million ha under cultivation similarly of the estimated 3 14 million ha irrigable land area only about 220 000 ha 7 is utilised
2205186 as government we have started looking at how our farmers have fared in the utilisation of land they were allocated
2205187 we want to establish who has done what on the land he was given and who has not
2205188 we are trying all we can as government to import food from other countries but we are faced with a challenge of raising foreign currency for the imports
2205189 that is why we have been encouraging our farmers to increase their output capacity so that we can halt importation of food
2205190 he has become solicitor and a bail contractor to fulani trouble makers and extorts huge sums of money from them ostensibly to bribe the chiefs and the police for their fulanis freedom
2205191 i know the big men in the police and political circles so nobody can touch me
2205192 whoever tries to rebuke or challenge him of his evil deeds becomes a target of his squad
2205193 it is during these difficult times that people have realised that all is not lost without rice the cassava farms in kailahun are encouraging pounded cassava has taken over
2205194 we have heard about the chinese imported rice but that is yet to reach us in kailahun i am not sure whether we will even benefit from it
2205195 this operation is expected to be implemented over nine months and will be completed by may 2009 a final report will be made available by august 30 next year three months after the end of the operation
2205196 the capacity of the government to import food will be constrained by soaring food prices and unavailability of foreign currency in the country the expected harvest may only reach 40 percent of the needs for 2008 and 2009
2205197 non governmental organisations are also free to source for assistance as long as they are registered organisations
2205198 we applaud and are committed to efforts such as the child health days campaign but we cannot forget that a growing number of children are suffering daily because of the ban on ngos
2205199 every day that such an important lifeline of humanitarian aid for children remains cut off puts the children of this country at ever greater risk
2205200 the nationwide campaigns are important life saving low cost and high impact support towards reducing child illnesses and deaths in zimbabwe
2205201 the days are an essential boost to a health system under great stress and children made vulnerable by declining social services
2205202 unless ptdf management increases the money to n41 million as contained in our proposal we will not embark on the exercise
2205203 coffee from congo is of poor quality compared to that in uganda
2205204 the rise is motivating farmers who have been patiently waiting for an upsurge but the price increments may not be sufficient enough to woo growers who abandoned the crop due to low prices we expect better prices next year
2205205 several synthetic vanillin factories in china closed down in 2007 due to environmental problems this pushed the prices of synthetic vanillin closer to those of natural vanillin the buyers started switching back to natural vanilla which boosted the prices
2205206 when they brought them chicken at least they could lay 14 eggs a day but now i can get only two eggs
2205207 they gave us these birds as a group of seven but all the others have withdrawn because we have to get money for medicine and it is expensive
2205208 they made me remove my healthy bananas only to be given these poor quality ones
2205209 the money is released but someone either at the ministry or district headquarters is squandering it
2205210 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2205211 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2205212 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2205213 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2205214 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2205215 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2205216 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2205217 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
2205218 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
2205219 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
2205220 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
2205221 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
2205222 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease
2205223 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2205224 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
2205225 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2205226 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
2205227 i wasnt trying to pick you up i just like your hat
2205228 the money was not for refinancing any other business it was meant for rice processing it will pay for equipment and infrastructure at four per cent interest five years moratorium with 15 years for repayment
2205229 we are targeting 10000 households per region we are targeting about 250000 people during the month of august
2205230 we hope next week the programme will be in full swing and emu can start with the monitoring exercise
2205231 my emphasis they are scared to be found out scared to show their true selves
2205232 and pray for one another that you will be healed
2205233 i feel i am now working only to service my housing loan
2205234 i cannot buy decent groceries anymore i shudder when any of my children get sick because then i also have to factor in medical bills among the many other monthly accounts i need to pay i find myself taking terrible chances of paying off one account while leaving out the other accounts until the next month
2205235 i cannot claim ownership of this house i guess if i continue paying off my installments i will only see a difference in the balance after six or more years and should i die at the end of a month and my family fails to pay the bank their money within the first seven days of that month they will stand to lose the house i feel like i have to keep a slice of bread under my pillow for the next day but paying off my house must come first
2205236 what is wrong here is there something wrong with the formula the banks use or what
2205237 i want to send a message to parliamentarians irrespective of their political affiliation this is a national issue that housing loans are a bread and butter issue parliamentarians and society at large should start a serious debate on the issue of accommodation because many families have lost their houses and many are likely to be affected by the high interest rates
2205238 currently government provides guarantees without satisfying itself with the value of properties being guaranteed
2205239 several cheap defensive explanations and excuses were put forth trying to justify the current unjustifiable repayment periods some of the banks are saying that the reason why homeowners scheme repayment period is 20 years is because the property value keeps on increasing this is not true the value can only increase if the owner goes for a second bond which means an increase on the existing loan amount as well as the existing interest rate
2205240 the current 20 years repayment period means overlapping of interest payment a need to separate the capital amount to be paid by the staff from the interest rate to be paid by the government
2205241 alternatively if commercial banks do not want to reduce the current period from 20 years government should get a loan from gipf government institutions pension fund or the social security commission to pay off all civil servants home owners scheme with less interest
2205242 the king was attracted to esther more than to any of the other women
2205243 when you want to champion the african green revolution we have gone over and above our own product which is fertilizer but rather understanding the value chain and eliminating all the bottlenecks to ensuring that the food gets from the farmers to the consumers in the right manner at the right price
2205244 nigeria and indeed sub saharan africa has the lowest fertilizer utilisation per hectare per annum in the world in which we have people that are extremely poor and hungry the situation would soon change for the better when notore begins production
2205245 starvation is at its highest in this part of the world and that is because we are not capable of feeding ourselves nigeria has the lowest utilisation of fertilizer in the world in nigeria a farmer is using about 8 10kg of fertilizer per hectate per annum when best practices should be as high as 200kg per hectare per annum
2205246 some countries actually use about 300kg hectare annum there is a link between increase in crop output and the application of fertilizer notores major goal is to help fix that problem and that is why we maintain that our company is championing the african green revolution by making high grade inputs available so with key inputs as fertilizer and fertilizer respondent seeds which guarantee multiple planting seasons as well as increase in total crop output per annum and crop protection products which help in ensuring that the rodents do not destroy your farm we believe we hold the key to africas green revolution
2205247 acquired the assets of the former nafcon in onne rivers state we have been through a two and half year refurbishment process and from september this year will start producing fertilizer first for nigeria and for the rest of africa we are going to be producing mpk and urea which i am sure everybody knows that these are the most responded fertilizers or one of the responding core to fertilizer
2205248 sales of our products that we would have very good customers among the right farmers
2205249 banks they also have problems trying to understand the actual people to speak with
2205250 before consolidation we all know that the banking sector would prefer to deal with high networth client because the cost of administration was less for them but they have realised post consolidation that there is no where else to go but the retail market and the retail market is you and i
2205251 last thing before every long run blair pulls us in offers an inspirational quote and sends us off with a unisoned mantra
2205252 i dont remember them all but sure do remember and enjoy cowboy up
2205253 to suck it up in times of adversity when the prospect of what you are about to do is so daunting that the best you can hope for is to simply live through it
2205254 you bet at about mile 22 of last years suntrust richmond marathon which was my first legs cramped body drained i looked up and asked my parents for some strength and then i looked on my wrist at the pink band the coaches had given each of us dont know if i actually read it or could have at that point but i sure knew what it said cowboy up
2205255 its structure and procedures violate the uniform code of military justice and all four geneva conventions
2205256 will be and indeed has been excluded from his own trial
2205257 its quite a coincidence that he was passed over for promotion within two weeks
2205258 nervous no excited yes i am not frightened by the challenge i have been through a lot in my career some good some bad but i desperately want to do well for the support i have had here from the chairman and the fans this is the best club i have been at as far as facilities and support is concerned i would love to emulate the success i have had at other clubs here because the club is ready for it and the supporters deserve it
2205259 there is pressure on every manager but at the end of the day if you cant deal with pressure and i have been through a lot over the past year it is no good being a manager
2205260 i believe in myself and i believe given the right amount of time i can deliver i know my stock might not be as high in some peoples eyes but i would ask them for patience and to give me a fair crack at getting a team and squad together i am pretty sure we can be competitive in this division and hopefully get out of it
2205261 there is no outstanding team in it as we sit here now there is a much of a muchness which makes it very difficult
2205262 look at the premier league there are probably three teams maximum four that can win it in league one i guess you could probably pick a winner from leeds mk dons peterborough and leicester city in the championship you can probably name 10 teams off the top of your head and add more to that i believe we have assembled a good squad and i believe we will get better and that we can sustain a challenge
2205263 he was disappointed at not being in the squad for utrecht and i was disappointed with his reaction in one training session and i told him so
2205264 it is done its dealt with i made my point sav came in on monday and trained properly to try to get in the team no problem i have got a lot of disappointed players because ive named the starting team and we have done our team play theres a lot of disappointed players sav probably one of them but that doesnt mean to say he wont be involved im not looking to score points over anybody the only points i am interested in is three points on saturday

2205273 there is no underlying reason for one of the greatest oil producers in the world to need to get into the nuclear energy business unless what they want to do is train and produce people and an infrastructure that can have highly enriched uranium or plutonium fissionable material for nuclear weapons
2205274 for a major oil producer such as iran nuclear energy is a wasteful use of resources
2205275 prepare against the time about 15 years in the future when iranian oil production is expected to decline sharply
2205276 it was in the u s national interest both economic and security interest to have such close relations in terms of nuclear power
2205277 has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons but if small states began building them then iran might have to reconsider its policy
2205278 they were an allied country and this was a commercial transaction we didnt address the question of them one day moving toward nuclear weapons
2205279 many countries brazil argentina israel were developing nuclear energy so they thought that iran should have nuclear power
2205280 we have noted the priority that his imperial majesty gives to developing alternative means of energy production through nuclear power this is clearly an area in which we might most usefully begin on a specific program of cooperation and collaboration
2205281 the secretary of state henry kissinger has asked me to underline emphatically the seriousness of our purpose and our desire to move forward vigorously in appropriate ways
2205282 would not have minded if the shah developed the bomb because the shah was a close ally of the united states remember iran had a long border with the soviet union if the shah did make a nuclear bomb that would have been a big deterrent against the ussr
2205283 it is an honor to be here with you mr cronkite i watched your news broadcasts for many years as a young man
2205284 some people suspect the iranians have the intention to develop a nuclear weapon
2205285 this is a matter of concern to us but this is not an imminent threat
2205286 lets say iran had announced back in 1985 that hey guys we want to make a uranium enrichment facility what do you think would have happened would the u s and european union have rushed to help iran no they would have done everything in their power to deny irans rights
2205287 they generate a lot of vibrations which must be controlled the centrifuges cant be contaminated because they are easily corroded once the centrifuges start working its not wise to shut them down and start them again this damages them there are all sorts of technical problems
2205288 the world is united and concerned about iranians desire to have not only a nuclear weapon but the capacity to make a nuclear weapon or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon
2205289 iran has not addressed the long outstanding verification issues or provided the necessary transparency to remove uncertainties associated with some of its activities
2205290 the qualitative and quantitative development of irans enrichment program continues to be fairly limited
2205291 the new language was written to rein in what u s officials see as tehrans ambitions to become the dominant military power in the persian gulf and across the middle east
2205292 has used nuclear energy as an excuse if iran quits now the case will not be over the americans will find another excuse
2205293 we are relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries intentions which are in turn based on their sense of security
2205294 ok u s policy toward irans nuclear program is wrong if you were president what would you do
2205295 i am very worried that something like chernobyl will happen to iran
2205296 if that happens the iranian people will pay the heaviest price
2205297 unlike dimona irans bushehr reactor not useful for weapons grade plutonium

2205306 in a highly competitive marketplace it is very difficult for one or a few institutions to hold the line on best practices or to stand on the sidelines in the face of booming markets
2205307 financial institutions must be subject to a higher degree of official oversight than is necessary for virtually all other forms of commercial enterprise however official supervision is not a substitute for effective management of financial institutions
2205308 whats needed is a form of private initiative that will complement official oversight by insisting on industry practices that will help mitigate systemic risk
2205309 were very fortunate weve had people come to conshohocken to invest and develop
2205310 at the same time because of the success of conshohocken our change from a blue collar to a white collar community weve lost some things towns can be a victim of their own success its time we add something for the residents
2205311 and we may still move the borough offices in there theres been no decision
2205312 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2205313 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2205314 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us
2205315 the public will desert any sport in time if theyre not satisfied by its integrity
2205316 there is a level of sophistication and intelligence that is evolving all the time
2205317 of course we didnt score and when you dont score youre not going to win
2205318 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2205319 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2205320 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2205321 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2205322 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2205323 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2205324 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression

2205399 stato il mio maestro e non mi stato di alcun ostacolo in questa delicata fase della mia vita quando ho ricevuto la proposta di passare a raidue ha dato il suo benestare e mi ha detto di informarmi di vagliare e poi scegliere bene un passaggio radicale un contratto diverso un lavoro a tratti nuovo laddio a mediaset e lingresso in rai per francesca comunque si tratta di una sorta di ritorno a casa mio padre da poco in pensione era giornalista telecinereporter proprio nella sede rai di corso sempione a milano e io fin da piccola sono andata moltissime volte a trovarlo ad aspettarlo l fuori entrare ora con il mio badge senette mi fa effetto ma avverto una sorta di aria familiare quasi un senso di appartenenza a convincerla a raccogliere la sfida del passaggio a raidue stato il progetto di un contenitore quotidiano due ore in diretta la conduzione da sola con ospiti in studio e argomenti di attualit con taglio giornalistico elementi che mi hanno spinta a credere
2205400 che si trattasse di unoccasione importante per mettermi alla prova come giornalista e come conduttrice
2205401 quella di uno spazio di approfondimento di riflessione e di analisi delle notizie che gi sono state date dai telegiornali un momento di pacata rilettura dei fatti sottolinea la senette che per modello ha maria luisa busi senette sente di aver molto da dimostrare a se stessa ma anche a chi ha creduto in me e a chi in me non crede ci sono preconcetti pregiudizi anche bene io vorrei solo lavorare con serenit seriet e onest intellettuale spero

2205406 comunque vero ognuno di noi ha un bagaglio musicale differente per me il rock antonio maggio viene dal pop antonio ancora dal funky jazz mentre raffaele ha le sue radici nella musica leggera
2205407 morgan una specie di meteora che passa e scompiglia tutto con noi la scintilla scattata nellultimo provino a milano quando venuto fuori con gli occhi lucidi e ci ha detto che ci avrebbe fatto cantare bohemian rapsody a lui ci lega un rapporto di grande stima e affetto reciproco per quanto riguarda per elisa invece pensiamo di aver mantenuto intatto lo spirtio del testo un messaggio sociale che trascende il tempo una denuncia contro la droga e la dipendenza che crea
2205408 prima di approdare in televisione noi abbiamo fatto tanta gavetta tradizionale esibizioni in locali feste concerti dal vivo e chiaro che x factor stato un ottimo trampolino di lancio per noi ma la gavetta serve sicuramente a formarti le ossa daltronde tutti i partecipanti alla trasmissione avevano trascorsi importanti questo si visto nellattenzione che il format ha prestato alla qualit della musica
2205409 lobiettivo oggi comunicare e da questo punto di vista la rete rappresenta una vera conquista e un mezzo diretto e democratico perch non obbliga a mediazioni un canale valido per proporre la propria musica e la propria arte senza dover sottostare alle imposizioni di case discografiche o alle scelte di palinsesto di radio e televisioni

2205422 the great mass of peoples throughout history and pre history have been vegans of necessity
2205423 big game hunting added little to our food intake until after we had evolved fully modern anatomy and behavior

2205443 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices
2205444 a tunnel can bring in a mobile phone but it cant bring in raw materials
2205445 its just a matter of time until they make a tunnel an elephant can walk through
2205446 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2205447 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2205448 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2205449 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2205450 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2205451 we were capturing a lot of carbon dioxide at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2205452 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2205453 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2205454 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
2205455 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
2205456 our babies ourselves how biology and culture shape the way we parent
2205457 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign

2205459 ive been to d c several times with my sister for school davis kind of gave us a cold shoulder
2205460 i think your representative should take the time of day to come out and shake your hand i like roes people not politics platform
2205461 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2205462 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know s complete record
2205463 the writing of a word or words with all necessary letters and diacritics present in an accepted standard order
2205464 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2205465 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2205466 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2205467 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2205468 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2205469 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2205470 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2205471 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2205472 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2205473 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2205474 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management contacted dispatcher and after captain requested it fuel was begrudgingly added to

2205480 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them

2205483 in fact the budget bill was the very next item on the agenda but democrats chose to adjourn before we could take it up because they are afraid to debate the issue

2205489 forget about everything you have become accustomed to during the last 20 years because things are going to be very different going forward

2205491 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak
2205492 it will be the consumer calling the shots rather than producers and marketing and sales people
2205493 innovation be it real or presumed wont determine when it is time to replace or change your gadget

2205583 the olympics is best explained as a panoply of savagely dramatic intensely pagan exhibitions of all that fascinates the reptilian brain within us a majestic undying fire a man running so fast that we lose him when we blink a woman hurling herself sixteen and a half feet into the air with nothing but a pole millions of exotic peoples huddled together around a circus freak show draped in flags and soaked in sweat this is not a gathering that exalts how far weve come this is a collective unwillingness to abandon the mud from which we rose
2205584 there are vocal qualities peculiar to men and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell
2205585 the crowd is much rougher than the metro north crowd theyre from long island what would you expect the track assignments are posted late people run over old ladies with walkers old ladies hit you with their purses to get a set on the over crowded trains be prepared

2205596 young people are the legacy when they ask older people to do something they are taken seriously as in the example of all the people who say that their kids convinced them to support obama

2205601 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
2205602 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
2205603 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
2205604 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease

2205611 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and professional golfer second
2205612 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could indentify with having risen from his oklahoma roots as part native american and serving his country in a 14 year army career
2205613 ive got to think its got to be right up there with the best round ive played all year
2205614 i think its the round of the year for sure its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2205615 i quite like the tough greens i like them when they get quick i like the imagination that are needed with the big curves
2205616 i think if your speed is good sometimes its easier to read the big breaks rather than if its just quite subtle and you cant tell if its a ball right or a ball left sometimes on poa annua it meaning the line of the putt looks straight but you cant really read them but im able to read these just a little bit better
2205617 i sort of try to take a little bit of confidence from the fact that if you look at a lot of other guys results they dont always play great in the majors
2205618 some guys play better than others all the time but others really struggle occasionally and i think this year has been the hardest set of majors that there have been or certainly that ive ever played in
2205619 so sometimes when your game is not quite on the mark these sort of tournaments really find you out and thats kind of what ive been feeling about it
2205620 i think more importantly it was the round that i felt most at ease out there and really calm with my emotions and in the moment and playing one shot at a time and thats what ive been struggling to do
2205621 obviously when youre not playing great golf its very easy to get frustrated out there on the golf course
2205622 we hebben de nationale bond gevraagd om hen onmiddellijk terug te laten vliegen
2205623 ik heb er nu een negatief oordeel over als je een maatschappelijke beweging op gang wilt brengen zijn dit soort acties contraproductief

2205639 bernie ecclestone will get sick of melbournes refusal to host a night race
2205640 we would be in a position to take advantage it would cost three times as much to develop a suitable facility on virgin land we have the basis for it right here in the middle of blacktown australias fastest growing area
2205641 the circuit would be one of the most exciting and demanding in this country and the equal of many internationally

2205648 were looking at it as two games with balanced repetitions
2205649 there are a few plays i wish i could take back
2205650 he threw some nfl balls in there that ball across the middle in the fourth quarter was a heck of a throw he scrambled around and did a nice job
2205651 its very very important for myself and my development for the team
2205652 i havent stepped into the situation any day in practice saying my performance will help me or not help me
2205653 i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way
2205654 i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose
2205655 when we started throwing nobody was around it wasnt like it was april and guys are working out or may and we have minicamp and im trying to push it i didnt have to push it because nobody was there so that worked in my favor
2205656 it always hurt to practice but it just didnt feel right
2205657 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon and she asked how was practice and how is the arm i said it was miserable this week i dont know it was just miserable this week your body just tells you sometimes
2205658 it felt too good after i hurt myself it sounds stupid but i didnt have the pain
2205659 i didnt have the pain during the night or waking up in the morning i didnt have the pain of when i would grab certain things i didnt have that anymore that was more mentally refreshing than anything else
2205660 i think most players ive seen as you get older you realize your years might be numbered
2205661 im not saying jake is done anytime soon but i think he knows hes comfortable here hes enjoying it his elbow feels good and hes definitely having a lot of fun
2205662 china has an ancient culture and this shows how the culture has developed
2205663 i dont have time to watch i have to make money
2205664 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
2205665 he threw some nfl balls in there he did a nice job
2205666 what a joke i got up this morning to watch the ceremony assuming that it would be on
2205667 they thought people could pretend to ignore such an important event was happening on the other side of the global its impossible
2205668 i cant understand how in 2008 in the area of instant access with multiple media outlets nbc behaves as if we are in 1950 and has the guts to make audiences wait for a live coverage that many other countries in the world can see as they are taking place
2205669 richest country in the world and we cant watch the olympic opening ceremony live its being shown live all over the world
2205670 nbc is an acronym for not airing before making big cash the chinese may censor their people over politics our corporate overlords sensor sic us over profits
2205671 when you go out to bat youve just got to bat you cant be a captain when you are batting
2205672 i just batted like i normally do i like to keep it simple do the simplest things as well as i can i went out to enjoy myself
2205673 i wouldnt say it is an easy job it can only get worse but ive had more good days than bad days
2205674 steve was magnificent to see him back to see him smiling and laughing again was great
2205675 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and professional golfer second
2205676 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could indentify with having risen from his oklahoma roots as part native american and serving his country in a 14 year army career
2205677 i think this is the best team weve had when we talk about team
2205678 we have a lot to play for this year and a lot to prove and were excited to see what were capable of
2205679 im proud of what our kids have done of the past two or three months weve had a really positive summer overall
2205680 our discipline off the field our discipline in mckale center and taking care of our obligations academically and athletically have us in a more positive situation heading into this season
2205681 ive got to think its got to be right up there with the best round ive played all year
2205682 i think its the round of the year for sure its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2205683 i quite like the tough greens i like them when they get quick i like the imagination that are needed with the big curves

2205689 obviously when youre not playing great golf its very easy to get frustrated out there on the golf course
2205690 playing on the pga tour prepared me for this week
2205691 ive been playing well and its getting better every week i know a lot of the guys and it just feels like another pga tour event
2205692 i thought going out early it was going to be softer on the greens but that wasnt the case
2205693 the wind started whipping when we got out there and the greens were not receptive either
2205694 i called home and said this is the hardest course ive ever played if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2205695 its a very difficult golf course no doubt about it the greens are very undulated very fast it really tests your patience and you have to be on it every shot
2205696 no hit fairways try to hit greens and get up and down for par
2205697 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2205698 he will always be remembered for winning the 1969 u s open the last player to win after being in local and sectional qualifying
2205699 our thoughts go out to his family and our membership mourns his loss yet we take solace that his legacy will inspire generations to come
2205700 weve got so much talent surrounding the quarterback its going to be hard for them to lose a game
2205701 with the coaching staff we have we can make adjustments throughout the game and put our quarterbacks in the best position possible well be fine
2205702 the most consistent performer the guy that makes the play the guy that is least likely to turn it over least likely to make poor decisions
2205703 weve just got to execute the offense just make good decisions and get the ball to our guys because weve got a lot of talent
2205704 we realize all we have to do is just get the ball in playmakers hands and make great decisions and the rest will take care of itself
2205705 it was unfortunate what happened to ryan you know you never want to see a teammate leave
2205706 andrew and i realize its our time to step up
2205707 if youre competing against someone its nice that its a great guy like jarrett lee
2205708 i could have lost my whole future im back here trying to do everything i can do to get back on the field be a leader and be a role model for the little kids
2205709 even driving to the store i think about should i put my seat belt on should i not i had to separate myself from a lot of my friends or people i grew up with they know what ive got to do
2205710 there needs to be a willingness to change your actions
2205711 first time non violent offenders this is typically their disposition
2205712 pringle has cooperated fully with authorities and it wouldnt be fair to make any further statements or judgements until all the facts have been ascertained and the judicial process has had a chance to work
2205713 smacking sound like pringles hand was smacking against the skin of his body
2205714 gelukkig is jesper een lange tijd al niet meer ziek geweest
2205715 oh jee politie boos mag niet stoute politie mama met boeven praten is heel gevaarlijk
2205716 nou interessant dan gaan we even uw auto doorlopen qua verlichtingen en remsysteem en dan kunt u verder hoor

2205719 ill tell you what if mccain does as good as he did calling plays on his campaign hes going to be ok
2205720 when we didnt act as a team they broke us down
2205721 its just pretty cool knowing that we could have just met the future president of the united states and that he cares enough to come to marshall
2205722 its a little bit different but its an emphasis that we feel as if we need and we want to make sure we get deep into our special teams from a concept standpoint so they understand how important they are
2205723 the guys that really caught my eye in the spring in the kick off returns were brandon saine and boom herron
2205724 those two guys did a great job bringing it up
2205725 im anticipating that hes going to be a guy with a passion to learn and thats the only thing that holds out people is can you learn what we are doing
2205726 hes a great kid and hes trained hard and hes nervous like any other freshman and im sure he didnt sleep last night
2205727 hes ready to go he had wrist surgery which was the major issue but hes ready to go
2205728 now are we gonna tackle him 600 times this summer no probably because we cant because it wouldnt be smart
2205729 hes going through some things right now and hes got to go through some hurdles but doug is a good kid
2205730 in hindsight now that hes a heisman contender its easy to say they messed up but that gets overplayed
2205731 if you look back on it they got the guy they wanted that year and that was colt mccoy daniel had a lot of question marks because he is built more like a linebacker is somewhat short for a quarterback doesnt have the strongest arm in the world and came out of a system where quarterbacks put up big numbers year after year and its hard to judge their talent
2205732 he had a cannon arm but most teams wouldnt touch him with a 10 foot pole because he is only 5 foot 10 on a good day
2205733 it had to be a team like kansas that took a chance on him primarily because they had no choice they would not have won a bcs game if it wasnt for reesing
2205734 he had a lot of connections with texas but his relationship with mark richt was the key thing for him choosing georgia
2205735 there was some talk that there was a girlfriend going to georgia he wanted to follow but i think in the end it was the comfort level with the coach as well as playing for a big time football program in a very competitive conference
2205736 hes a small town country boy that is best suited to play in a smaller college town
2205737 they are viewing him as a savior down there the reason he went there was because of the atmosphere and the open depth chart
2205738 hay buena disposici n de ambas partes para que haya un acuerdo lo m s pronto posible

2205749 it is not very surprising given the structural weakness of the italian economy
2205750 policy differences wont lead to demotion of the central bank governor
2205751 but if that difference is so wide one policy must stay and the other must go
2205752 welcome any positive proposal that supports network rails board accountable to its members to continue with its objectives of exercising best practice in corporate governance

2205754 it is high time we ended the fat controller bonuses at network rail where the bosses reap huge rewards regardless of performance failures

2205773 you can point to 15 or 20 over a 10 year period
2205774 but there are thousands of films released and the odds are that youre not going to do all that well
2205775 you want at least six to 10 films in your portfolio because you cannot predict what is going to be a hit
2205776 the eis offers the widest set of tax breaks in the uk at the moment
2205777 but these are not products for the man in the street

2205798 the crb cannot get involved in making employment decisions these are solely a matter for employers
2205799 it is quite right that under the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 employees do not generally have to disclose spent convictions
2205800 but because the government is committed to protecting the vulnerable spent convictions may have be disclosed before people can take up employment in certain roles or enter certain professions
2205801 crb checks perform a vital role protecting vulnerable groups having stopped more than 20 000 unsuitable people last year from gaining access to children and vulnerable adults
2205802 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2205803 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2205804 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2205805 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2205806 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2205807 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives

2205809 its good youre making visits to stores you cant rely on the industry to get your books on the shelves these days
2205810 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2205811 what does this mean to you as a writer only this its easy to begin to think of your own potential readership as being comprised of the same kinds of folks you see at work or at play or bearing a strong resemblance to the famiy next door after a while its only natural to imagine most people in the country itself are pretty much like the folks you see every day well most folks are but those arent your readers usually your reader is yourself
2205812 make yourself your intended reader by writing to you as your reader you get closer than at any other time to getting your real voice on the page you write naturally
2205813 heres lookin at you kid a new and different way of looking at your audience

2205815 for akshay kumar this film may just make him the new box office king
2205816 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity
2205817 understanding the sociology of obesity is much more important than understanding the biology
2205818 they may not be aware of it our computers can trace out these patterns without the individual necessarily knowing them
2205819 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2205820 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2205821 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 km h
2205822 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2205823 anyone can see this is painful from 50 feet away
2205824 i wanted people to understand the psychological ramifications of this
2205825 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2205826 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2205827 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2205828 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2205829 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2205830 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
2205831 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2205832 one hundred fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia
2205833 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight

2205836 oh did you remember to invite so and so the guy who was my postgrad student and i was his thesis adviser
2205837 well if you left your husband three days earlier than youd planned you could see your parents for two days while youre in seattle just before youre about to work on a 10 day contract with brand new music and a director
2205838 even if youre upset with them you only get one set of parents you dont get to pick your family theyre all you have you have to make nice
2205839 now sweetheart we all have obligations to our family not everyone has enough time to call you and keep up with everything it is that youre doing we have lives too and we know youre a very busy girl with all that traveling you do and its your duty to make an effort to see your relatives while youre in town and dont say that we havent been supportive we came to every piano recital you had when you were little and every choir concert weve done our part now why dont you go set the table for dinner
2205840 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
2205841 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2205842 silicon valley futurist michael h goldhaber wrote an influential essay entitled attention shoppers which suggested that the great scarcity in the 21st century digital media economy will be attention
2205843 estos grabando otro album pronto tengo una maquina protools bajando las escaleras en mi casa porque grabo en mi casa ahora no puedo prender la maldita cosa risas es como el cerebro de la casa pero cuando hay alguien que sabe lo que hace es muy facil hacer discos ahora ya no es divertido el arte de hacer discos esta decayendo le esta quitando la pasi n pero tratar de darme lo m s real que pueda hay muchos trucos que puedo usar quiero hacer dos discos hacer uno y salir con ese despues sacar otro y salir con ese tambi n el tiempo es valioso para mi ahora cumplo 60 en diciembre no parece que hayan pasado 10 a os desde que tenia 50 de verdad que no mi mision ahora es dar lo mas que pueda

2205846 china is a strictly censored country and our goal in making this broadcast is to criticise the chinese government
2205847 we want to tell the chinese government that on the day that the olympics open the people will still be able to hear voices the government doesnt want heard
2205848 its 12 hours before the opening of the olympics a time when we want these voices heard
2205849 bronze shrinks approximately 10 percent from the plaster molds so that wasnt a possible shrink value
2205850 john mccain is continuing an aggressive campaign schedule throughout the week next week where he will discuss the contrast and the choice americans have in the poll particularly focusing on jobs and the economy
2205851 but for the rest of us times are tough painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2205852 the hands that built this nation can build a new economy
2205853 though like the rest of america were all going to be focused on how many golds our athletes bring home well be working just as hard to ensure that voters are hearing about senator obamas positive vision for our country and our new energy for america plan that provides immediate relief and brings us closer to energy independence
2205854 this will be the highest amount of eyeballs that are available between now and election day
2205855 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2205856 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2205857 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2205858 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2205859 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2205860 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2205861 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2205862 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2205863 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2205864 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2205865 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2205866 the dust helps us say definitively that pollution is coming from china
2205867 the u s air quality standard is 15 micrograms per cubic meter
2205868 its bad if youre educated you probably live in an urban area but your life expectancy in the city is 58 years its 72 in the countryside
2205869 and takes about a week to cross the pacific to the western u s where it accounts for as much as 15 percent of the air pollution
2205870 by the time they get to us a lot of it has fallen out our concentrations are low but it is the long term deposition we are concerned about even a little bit of mercury over a long period of time becomes significant
2205871 fish are lipid balls they have a lot of fat
2205872 methyl mercury is efficiently taken up following consumption and poses the main potential risk
2205873 two to ten fold higher in newborns in the arctic region than in newborns from regions farther south
2205874 biological effects of airborne contaminants include impacts on reproductive success growth behavior disease and survival subsistence hunters and gatherers in alaska depend on wild food sources that may be affected by airborne contaminants
2205875 the health benefits of eating fish far outweigh any potential risk
2205876 so why is the state moving forward to destroy fish and game habitat in our backyard with a huge strip mine and compounding the problem by putting our fish at risk of more mercury from coal
2205877 and mercury contamination from coal is not compatible with smart fish management
2205878 we sincerely hope that chinas time honored history and civilization vibrant urban and rural lives and the hospitality of the chinese people will leave you all with pleasant memories of the country
2205879 as one world we grieved with you over the tragic earthquake in sichuan province we were moved by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2205880 as one dream may these olympic games bring you joy hope and pride
2205881 today brunei decided not to register any athletes for competion and as a consequence the ioc has decided to exclude brunei noc officials from the opening ceremony and the games
2205882 it is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them the ioc tried up until the last minute midday today to have them register but to no avail

2205903 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2205904 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2205905 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2205906 and i know how great it can be in this city am i ready to face it handle it deal with it i think so i think its a great opportunity it can be as good as you want to make it
2205907 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2205908 i woke up this morning and the trigger was pulled
2205909 i hope i can play at the level that ive always played at
2205910 theres no guarantees there have never been any guarantees for me its football and anything can happen

2205912 there are people on the street who would give anything for a job a home a bed
2205913 im not allowed to sit down for a five minute break people with business suits sit down on the sidewalk all of the time and the police go right past them
2205914 we have plenty of reasons to be skeptical that the process that will happen on aug 11 will not result in their voices being reflected in the report that comes out of that meeting
2205915 theres no indication that the committee will suggest a repeal of the ordinance
2205916 im going to take a good hard look at the ordinance
2205917 i was very moved by what i heard it was a powerful forum
2205918 a light will shine through that window a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
2205919 the uncertainty has led to high levels of stress and anxiety both of which negatively impact on their mental and physical health
2205920 these include insomnia anxiety poor appetite and headaches authorities have not communicated any plans for the reintegration of the displaced nor have they properly engaged in a dialogue with the camp residents about options for their immediate future
2205921 it is unacceptable that people who were forced from their homes once again are left out in the cold having to find solutions for themselves
2205922 it is imperative that they receive the protection and assistance afforded to them under national and international law
2205923 the perpetrators of these crimes are either under the influence of substances or trying to secure money for their next fix
2205924 when they leave they take their skills and capital with them and drastically reduce the prospects for growth and job creation for the unemployed so in a nutshell drug abuse is everyones problem
2205925 in 2004 government disbanded the sa narcotics bureau sanab a dedicated drug fighting unit within the saps that had achieved some notable successes since its closure drug related crimes have increased exponentially in fact by 30
2205926 drug and alcohol abuse in my view may prove to be an even more fundamental threat to south africas future than hiv aids
2205927 the growing young legions of substance abusers are destroying themselves their families and their communities they are driving crime up and the economy down
2205928 one in two schoolchildren admits to having experimented with drugs
2205929 people live in fear of the gangsters who sell their drugs they worry themselves sick about their children falling prey to them
2205930 this fear and anxiety is not a product of media hype as safety and security minister charles nqakula so often likes to claim it is the reality on the ground a place where our government seldom looks
2205931 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do

2205953 if you think about it were in a playoff race and it seems crazy for them to trust the teams success to five guys who are 26 years old or younger
2205954 obviously we are a team that can score runs and everything but if we dont pitch we arent going to be successful
2205955 so there is a lot on our shoulders to help this team do well but i think they wouldnt have done that if they didnt trust us to get it done i think this is an opportunity for all of us to make a name for ourselves
2205956 he shouldnt be sitting he should be pitching im happy for him
2205957 obama continues to face a series of arbitrary and shifting public tests merely because he is black
2205958 obama really does care about ordinary people its genuine in him and i think when its displayed itll make a huge difference despite the fact that his success in berlin is being used against him i think it was good for him to do the country needs change and lots and lots of people understand that and finally mccain whatever he was back when the press fell in love with not that person anymore hes a crotchety clumsy small spirited man and i think that will become apparent the ads that hes putting up now demonstrate that i think obama will win

2205979 reading the guidelines for communal discernment a resource for the 218 general assembly of the presbyterian church usa i am reminded of c s lewiss narnia book the silver chair in that story prince rilian jill scrubb and the marsh wiggle puddleglum face the witch queen of the underland
2205980 communal discernment engages a group of people to follow the leading of the holy spirit it involves prayer a humble surrendering of control reflection on scripture and listening carefully to one another as together we seek to hear gods voice
2205981 discernment seeks more than group agreement the goal is to recognize when it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us acts 15 28

2206008 wolfmother toured the world virtually non stop through 2006 and early 2007 on the back of their acclaimed self titled debut album
2206009 longstanding frictions within the group then led them to take an extended break during the second half of 2007 to consider their future
2206010 following that show chris ross decided to announce that he was leaving the band due to irreconcilable personal and musical differences
2206011 myles heskett has also decided to leave the band rather than continuing as part of a changed lineup
2206012 the pair has been working together on songs for some time and they plan to focus their energies on that new project in the future
2206013 they simply ask all wolfmother fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has led to the decisions announced today
2206014 are you hearing this s t what year are we in forgive me but wolfmother you suck

2206020 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2206035 sometimes they had to worship in secret hiding like they were doing something wrong but now we are free to spread our religious views to try and win other people to it
2206036 emancipation has given the church a great deal of freedom to exercise its ministry in the bahamas
2206037 we share in his image and we are the high apex of creation
2206038 there is a passage in galatians chapter 5 that tells us christ will set us free
2206039 now sometimes many people in the western world and in countries like the bahamas take that freedom for granted this is because in this time freedom has always been there for us so we do not treasure or value it as much as we ought to in many other places people long and struggle to have the kind of freedoms we enjoy so we ought to become aware of really what it means to be free
2206040 some people think that because they have the right to do things it doesnt really matter what they do they do their own thing and to them it doesnt matter who it affects but there are limits to freedom so as christian men and women we must realize we are free and be thankful that we are free nevertheless i think emancipation is a very important aspect of our history and we ought to celebrate it and mark the date
2206041 vigilance is the eternal price of liberty so is education thats why we must make a continual effort to open peoples minds and to get them to think and act in ways where they take responsibility for their own lives a lot of people like to blame others for their problems and its not so they actually have the freedom of choice but if we teach them that they will mature and exercise their god given freedoms in the right manner
2206042 although we must thank god for the progress we have made as a race and as a country we must work on abolishing the residual effects of slavery on our people
2206043 part of the slave routine was to train black people to hate themselves and so there are still many blacks who are uncomfortable with their skin
2206044 on the other hand part of emancipation was not only to free the slaves but to free their masters as well this is because you cannot keep people in slavery without enslaving in some why yourself so emancipation had mutual effect on both the slaves and their masters as we move forward part of the way moving forward is the churchs work against slavery in the past some churches threw holy water on slavery its a part of our history that we cannot change but we have to move forward as a christian community its for the better for it
2206045 we couldnt worship like we do today and couldnt live like we do nor could we go the places that we do but some of us are still enslaved the mind is a powerful force but nevertheless the mind can be changed
2206046 emancipation commemorates our forbears being freed from the horrendous evil of slavery
2206047 slavery was and is one of the most devastating symbols of the effects of sin
2206048 freedom is one of the primary signs of our nature as human beings god created us to be like him god is absolutely free he made us in his image and likeness with a soul intellect will and a body slavery was and is a lie god throughout history has revealed himself as a god who sets free israel experienced it and every people at some time or another have experienced it
2206049 since then because of the love of jesus expressed on the cross destroying the power of sin and death over us nothing can ever again keep us down nothing can degrade or demean us no matter how long it takes the power of gods love unleashed through jesus on the cross forever changed the course of history that is what paul is so ecstatic about our forebears and all of us through jesus christ have been set free in the concrete historical circumstance of our life in this land and throughout the region
2206050 to be free from selfishness means being able to love others by serving them even to the point of self sacrifice being free to develop our gifts means helping others develop themselves in spite of all this we yearn to be free free to let go of relationships or of things we may be addicted to for example drugs alcohol lying stealing laziness free to commit ourselves to family to work hard to admit mistakes free to be able to ask for help free to tolerate and to listen to other peoples opinions free to embrace a bigger world than ourselves free to admit that we once were in slavery as a people though i am not sure that we admit that
2206051 there is no reason why a co location hospital has to be on the same campus as an existing public hospital this can be seen in limerick where the co location hospital is five minutes away from limerick regional hospital
2206052 cork university hospital is already over developed with considerable existing difficulties in terms of parking and traffic in the wilton area there needs to be an alternative proposal for a co location hospital if it is to go ahead

2206054 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2206055 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2206056 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2206057 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2206058 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2206059 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2206060 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2206061 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2206249 if it was mutt williams it would be mutt williams and the search for elvis or something
2206250 for those transfers they used generally us 1 000 to open the account of those 200 or 300 dollars remained in the account to make the transfers and the rest were given to the citizens whom they used
2206251 generally they received several amounts of money but the ben tez brothers very few times did transferes receiving them themselves
2206252 every week we found somebody new that has received transfers for the ben tez
2206253 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2206254 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2206255 i really wish they would just let the process go through well win the whole thing is very unconstitutional theyre violating the canada health act and women dont have equal access to abortion in this province they do not
2206256 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
2206257 our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful it will do so
2206258 were surrounded by 150 000 people who want to live here
2206259 if a ski resort is financed from the sale of lots the developer better look into how profitable the ski area can be with people not using their homes all the time
2206260 to a ski resort that could consistently disappoint down the road
2206261 it was not the right fit at the right time
2206262 maclays being very cautious going slow trying to make good decisions
2206263 its too early to say but everthings on the table
2206264 well the usfs denied him so i guess thats that
2206265 who will get the 800 000 plus dollars to do the work and who will do the work
2206266 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2206267 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
2206268 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2206269 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it
2206270 ive been to d c several times with my sister for school davis kind of gave us a cold shoulder
2206271 i think your representative should take the time of day to come out and shake your hand i like roes people not politics platform
2206272 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2206273 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know steve cohens complete record
2206274 team blues rally 2 but the switchbox 3000 is missing the new background for all player is a gym background and costs 60 coins as always and if you throw a snowball on the stage its a dodgeball
2206275 drug users go to the pusher for their drug and the pushers keep the streets plentiful with drugs
2206276 similarly marketers go to list services for their drug and many of these list services sell tainted goods and its these list services that fuel the spread of spam
2206277 i had to delete my e mail box just to free up our server
2206278 weve got a full time staff dedicated to making sure our clients dont spam
2206279 there are all kinds of factors that affect e mail deliverability
2206280 this is a client who does not have internal know how on doing large campaigns and is not willing to let us do it for him
2206281 the first was a much smaller project of around 10 000 addresses and they were very happy with it it went very well so they came back
2206282 its like someone buying an ad and then saying i didnt get any business i want my money back
2206283 is there perhaps a society of indentured servants as well complete with certification pay money and someone will count and certify the number of holes in your head
2206284 if you think im going to throw my white sox under the bus because im here in minnesota thats not going to happen
2206285 its probably better that way they were a very nice group everyone was very polite we didnt have any problems with any of them
2206286 i believe in him and i believe the country believes in the change that barack can bring to us
2206287 my pancakes are still in there but i dont care
2206288 its a very important time in our country and to be able to see someone running for president that may change the focus of our country is very important
2206289 we dont tell the children who were voting for but im sure well be talking about this when we get back
2206290 i believe in genes philosophy and i enjoy the passion people have about priest we are still provoking reaction some of it is positive some of its negative thats life
2206291 we believe in it 100 percent and were having a great time playing some of the music in concert we cant wait to play the whole thing in performance to me its going to be no different than going to see something like phantom of the opera there is this wonderful element of music and theater
2206292 the thing about satire is that you can only satirize great events in life
2206293 you cant make fun of something that no one has knowledge about thats why im a saturday night live fan a fan of the colbert report or the daily show im a huge fan of satire that is done in a smart and intelligent way spinal tap was great if youre satirized in that manner you must be doing something right
2206294 he was accused of dabbling in the black arts doing bad things he was threatened with being burned at the stake people were slamming doors in his face hmm this sounds familiar in our world we have our detractors and we push back against them thats what metal is
2206295 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2206296 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2206297 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2206298 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2206299 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2206300 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2206301 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2206302 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2206303 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2206304 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2206305 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2206306 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2206307 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2206308 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2206309 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2206310 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2206311 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2206312 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2206313 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2206314 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2206315 understandably with such a group i was drawn not to the cataclysms and monsters of the apocalypse
2206316 but rather to its silences of adoration its marvelous visions of peace
2206317 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2206318 if we send multipart emails html and plain text wont our esp software serve up the text email to blackberry devices and other smart phones
2206319 we are focused on becoming the premier health and wellness company
2206320 its always better to have a real piece of fruit
2206321 permission is not a free pass we have to continuously earn the right to our subscribers inbox
2206322 a screed about how some in the space are dissing the competition to make sales
2206323 people might not appreciate the fact they didnt get an extra five minutes
2206324 we know what happened obviously and well take that into account when we do an evaluation of the exam
2206325 has been asked to perform a psychometric study on whether the earthquake impacted applicants performance on the first session of the examination and to report his findings
2206326 to ensure that all applicants are treated as fairly as possible
2206327 while the committee regrets that this incident occurred the fact that it did was beyond its control
2206328 the fast growing college division of the washington post company
2206329 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
2206330 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
2206331 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the
2206332 our children dont need another test they need better schools
2206333 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country
2206334 while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2206335 we will need to go back and look at our options
2206336 we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2206337 creating a taxpayer funded community college in todays economy is impractical and unproductive
2206338 there are all sorts of things that apply in criminal proceedings that dont apply to performance review
2206339 i was watching something on mtv or vh 1 about how changed over the years
2206340 and they had all these rappers lined up saying its not about lyrics anymore
2206341 but they give me encouragement constructive criticism and good support so im thinking differently about the music im making
2206342 and its worth saying the key is that we do all of these things plenty of third party marketers do some of them but deliverability has never been about finding a silver bullet its about pulling on all the levers that influence reputation to achieve optimum inbox placement were not where we want to be but weve made great strides improving our reputation and our inbox placement
2206343 we cant get bad mail delivered that subscribers dont want no matter how good our software or people are
2206344 when marketers have nothing else they usually at least have an open rate
2206345 the open rate is still a very clear indicator of success the more opens the better
2206346 watching opens go up is addictive like no other metric you can watch in real time
2206347 it has never bothered me that the open rate doesnt actually represent the exact number of people who opened
2206348 use the open rate if you know its limits and when and how to apply it
2206349 you are receiving this email because you registered for the recent xyz conference
2206350 his personal integrity unstinting humanity and unlimited commitment to his responsibilities
2206351 my goal from the very beginning was replacing the internal combustion engine just getting that off the streets
2206352 all of a sudden i got weary of hammering silver
2206353 gallant fight on behalf of the districts homeless and dependent children while others in positions in power have scurried to the sidelines on this important issue
2206354 interests were more local than national and the white house became a little bit upset because he seemed to them more democrat than republican
2206355 the apartment record came out while we were on tour and after just a couple weeks we started noticing our audiences were acting different
2206356 so we did the only thing we could we switched styles and we havent regretted it for a minute
2206357 passionless seemingly ruled by a metronome it all comes across lifelessly a bit more immediate than muzak but ultimately just as numbing
2206358 lets face it we dont appeal to hard core classical music lovers but id like to think that the music we play can in a small way help people come to know and like classical music a little better
2206359 and thats not such a bad thing to be doing
2206360 he was a remarkable man and there certainly would not have been an opera company in dallas like ours if it had not been for him
2206361 he and larry kelly put together some incredible productions incredible both musically and visually
2206362 la scala west the dallas opera under kelly and rescigno
2206363 i have been thwarted in my efforts to give dallas the best opera possible
2206364 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2206365 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2206366 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
2206367 my big regret is that i didnt get to do it
2206368 i did have the chance but i didnt take advantage of it
2206369 tremendously talented musician with a subtle sense of poetry and musicianship he wasnt loud he wasnt flashy but very sensitive
2206370 behind the scenes innovator on the folk scene for decades
2206371 walk right in sit right down baby let your mind roll on
2206372 introduced new songs and styles to the group and really held his own
2206373 pete never swung the way erik could swing his banjo could take command and carry everybody along with it
2206374 felt at odds with some of our political stances there was no pressure but he was reading ayn rand and had a libertarian streak
2206375 was constantly full of surprises erik would disappear for a while and all of a sudden pop up with songs or an album so completely off the wall and different and of such high quality
2206376 let me tell you what an exclusive track is its the worst song i have honest to god what youre going to be getting is the worst song i have thats not going to be on the record
2206377 wow i got this really bad bonus song on this great new kid rock album
2206378 youve got yourself aligned so well to make a great rock n roll record but youve said that youre kid expletive rock 8 000 times we understand that
2206379 dig deep and write something relevant what you see going on youre one of the few people who still live where youre from you havent migrated to new york l a miami wherever london it seems like you should have your finger on the pulse
2206380 whats the matter with you we know youve dabbled in this country thing but leave it alone its going to wreck your career stay out of nashville
2206381 its the way we style stuff for photo shoots you mix crazy things but if you get it in the same general color scheme its a little easier to take
2206382 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2206383 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2206384 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2206385 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2206386 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2206387 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2206388 i almost get tired of hearing myself say the word surreal
2206389 melissas been doing really awesome i think she deserved to win
2206390 melissa has a great voice and story shes going to be very relatable to a good portion of the country audience
2206391 she just has to have songs that are equally relatable and memorable
2206392 a lot of those efforts have just seemed sort of forced gabe garcia comes off as very authentic and talented his heritage is who he is rather than a marketing gimmick
2206393 im just going to stay who i am im going to deliver everything that i can and continue to be myself
2206394 theres going to have to be a lot of changes weve had our house in arlington on the market for a few months now we will make a move here to nashville
2206395 its always been a lot of give and take there have been times when hes been working and ive been the one at home
2206396 life is full of challenges its our job to just go over those hurdles and keep moving forward
2206397 they so just wanted to see the truck that we won
2206398 they were like we did it yeah mom ok lets go see the truck they were climbing all over that thing fingerprints everywhere
2206399 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
2206400 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
2206401 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
2206402 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
2206403 if you get injured youre not going to be able to help your pet
2206404 he did have an initial wellness exam apart from how obese he is his teeth look great until blood work comes back we cant say anything about choosing an adoptive family because if the cat has a thyroid condition or diabetes we want to make sure that the adoptive family would be comfortable administering any medication he may need
2206405 it really was necessary to protect prince chunk because the media had gotten so aggressive with photographers hiding out in the bushes
2206406 the mist in the air that we see is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
2206407 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
2206408 but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
2206409 respiratory and heart diseases related to air pollution are the leading cause of death in china
2206410 it was stressed that there is now an urgent need to get them the united states to halt the illegal actions of the georgian side the withdrawal of its armed forces from the conflict zone and a return to the implementation of earlier agreements
2206411 on balance i think the auctions were received better than expected
2206412 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industrywide failure of the ars market
2206413 investors have been living a nightmare being locked up in these investments
2206414 we are not going to allow this nightmare to continue
2206415 we need to make restitution and make it promptly to those investors who find themselves trapped in this auction rate nightmare and we dont think this is responsive
2206416 its a start i dont think it goes far enough theres more work to be done
2206417 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
2206418 the tibetans continue to try and protest in small groups and as long as they keep coming we will detain them
2206419 the total number of detainees has reached 1 100 they are being held at various police stations and will be released later on friday
2206420 tibetans have been dismayed at chinas interference in tibet for a long time this day is an opportunity for us to attract the worlds attention
2206421 ive been coming here nearly every day for the past three months and i will continue
2206422 in a few years the chinese will take over everything
2206423 in the city youre just going from curb to curb
2206424 on the college campus theres so many zigzags so many decisions to make id stop and ask sighted people and theyd be as lost as i was
2206425 the first day hed been to the dormitory twice and that was it he already knew where it was
2206426 i cant go to a movie at 5 if the dog needs to eat at 6
2206427 a cane can be isolating but people will usually go up to you if you have a dog
2206428 you have to spend a lot of time telling people that youre ok
2206429 how alert the dog is how in tune the dog is with you it looks like he enjoys it the signs are his tails going all the time
2206430 a guide dog is lucky it gets to go wherever its owner goes
2206431 i have four boys ages 10 and under and when i saw this i thought my god said sherman mayor bill magers
2206432 but when you hear about the dead it just hits you
2206433 you never want something like this to happen in your community but the good news is that our first responders did a magnificent job
2206434 what we know is a tremendous amount of people were injured and they are going to require a lot of blood
2206435 we were down to a one day supply in north texas
2206436 and just to clarify it only downloads a list of applications it doesnt tell apple what apps you are running get your facts straight
2206437 it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
2206438 either there is some mechanism that can be activated to kill the app entirely or this isnt really designed to kill malicious applications as advertised but rather applications that interfere with apples business model
2206439 either way the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
2206440 this information is important because it indicates the significant degree to which people and pets are being exposed to tick borne diseases and potentially serious illnesses
2206441 we can definitely track the explosion in tick populations by following the deer
2206442 the deer have also been responsible for relocating ticks a raccoon might travel a few miles in a lifetime deer travel much farther
2206443 its wonderful that wildlife is coming back and that were preserving nature but a consequence is more ticks
2206444 you need to help out too to the extent you can limit wildlife populations where the dogs go and at least if you know wildlife is around frequently check your dog for ticks quick removal of ticks is wise also clear brush in front of your home and dont bathe your dog immediately after application of a tick product wait at least two or three days realistically ticks are pretty resilient
2206445 if lyme is common where you live your veterinarian may suggest this vaccine dogs with lyme are treated with antibiotics
2206446 white cell counts go through the roof and then a muscle wasting occurs there is no cure we put the dogs on pain meds and an antiprotozoa medication for the rest of the dogs lives
2206447 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2206448 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2206449 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2206450 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2206451 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2206452 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2206453 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2206454 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
2206455 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
2206456 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
2206457 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
2206458 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
2206459 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
2206460 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success
2206461 its kind of like monica had two lives with two families
2206462 from a social standpoint its very hard on the animal
2206463 they are members of the family and you do have a special bond with them
2206464 until we can get a better understanding on how this legislation may affect future growth
2206465 and there are smaller numbers of people involved in the animals life
2206466 it makes you feel good about the world around you
2206467 it may be a short bond but its a real bond
2206468 from years of playing on the computer i had talked to plenty of people
2206469 i never ever thought in my life this is where im going to find my husband
2206470 i guess it was the hearts part that drew me in
2206471 he was beautiful and he was so polite and he spoke so gentlemanly he was actually interested in my head rather than a little lower
2206472 all i could think was the picture she sent me online nowhere did her justice
2206473 we were both real young and didnt always know what to do but we always knew how to talk about it this man had walked into my life and he wasnt giving up i had always been given up on before
2206474 i looked at him and i thought to myself he didnt even get down on one knee or say he wanted to get married
2206475 it wasnt the way i had always dreamed of it as a little girl
2206476 i remember i was crying some and i said i wanted to grow old with him
2206477 im absolutely convinced that both candidates would do well to get animals into photo opportunities
2206478 at best fuel economy stayed the same while power increased
2206479 it can be made out of anything you only need 1 gallon of water per gallon of ethanol
2206480 everyone can benefit from green fuel as soon as its out
2206481 no one needs to go buy a new car to use it
2206482 what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2206483 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2206484 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2206485 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2206486 in people like anderson nani and tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2206487 and the older ones have looked after themselves their concentration levels are still good and so is their desire
2206488 if anything paul scholes passing is the best it has ever been
2206489 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there
2206490 but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2206491 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2206492 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2206493 youre a harvard professor im a janitor with an 8th grade education youre a hopeless idiot
2206494 i hope this idiot loses control and crashes into a lightpole someday

2206503 they need some minutes on the clock before the start of the season
2206504 the community shield is a prestigious match but i have used players in it who were not quite fit and we are more or less in the same situation again
2206505 you can suffer this kind of thing from time to time when you have had a cruciate operation
2206506 we are trying to manage the swelling but he is not ready to take part in any games it is unfortunate for the lad because he was looking forward to the new season
2206507 arrangements should be made now for united or maybe even city so we dont have this embarrassing situation again simply put if you win a cup there should be civic recognition
2206508 there was an overreaction after the rangers trouble and a failure of the responsible bodies to organise a parade which would have enabled fans who couldnt afford to go to moscow or indeed last nights match to be part of the glory
2206509 i am very glad that rangers lost and effectively banned themselves from european competition a minority of their supporters were guilty of disgraceful behaviour here in manchester
2206510 wayne will probably miss the start of the season and louis sahas future is undecided at the moment its left us a little short up front im sure well find the goals at the start of the season though our play is good enough
2206511 it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
2206512 and he knows i feel exactly the same way about him he has been one of the most important people in my playing career
2206513 i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on
2206514 people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
2206515 sympathy from those who earn in five years what the portuguese winger picks up in a week
2206516 le classement de shangha montre la n cessit absolue de la r forme de lenseignement sup rieur en france r novation des campus r formes des premiers cycles universitaires en 2009 autonomie des universit s ces mesures sont indispensables pour donner la france une visibilit internationale et une attractivit mondiale
2206517 ne permettent pas de juger au mieux la pertinence p dagogique et scientifique des universit s fran aises
2206518 nous devons le prendre en compte et faire en sorte de donner plus de visibilit aux universit s fran aises
2206519 sometimes people get injured and miss games that is what happens others have to come in and step up hopefully that is what will happen next week
2206520 we are a bit short of firepower up front but we have a big squad and our strong defence will give us something to build on
2206521 with wayne rooney probably out of the opening game and louis sahas future unclear we are a bit short up front
2206522 but at the start of a season i always feel we will find a goal because the players are good enough
2206523 we are looking sharper as each game goes by in fitness terms and while there is a little bug going round i am sure the lads will be flying next week
2206524 we have to be ready for the challenge that lies ahead bobdazzle whoever you are i wouldnt retain frasier not since he left cheers and niles started managing arsenal psychological problems mostly
2206525 whats all this formations didnt we always play 4 4 2
2206526 im going to pause here so everyone can have a sense of suspense
2206527 mom why is no one paying any attention to me why do they keep disappearing like im hideous or something
2206528 whyd they all leave why wont they listen to me
2206529 what we achieved last season was great but this is a completely new season now and we have to be just the same if not better and ready for the year ahead
2206530 we did it last year and it is always great to win we will definitely going there to win as well and its an important game to get ready for the start of the season against newcastle
2206531 ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay
2206532 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
2206533 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being responsible for the poor relationship between the clubs
2206534 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
2206535 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid
2206536 saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own conscience
2206537 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
2206538 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
2206539 i flew to portugal some weeks ago and cleared the air
2206540 i think the fans have got to understand it is very difficult for a young boy tempted by all this money he is a young lad from madeira his dad died a young man hes looked after his mother and his sister
2206541 cristiano knows more than anything that he is very happy here
2206542 i just think that this would be a waste of taxpayers dollars
2206543 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2206544 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2206545 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2206546 unfortunately house speaker mike madigan has decided to oppose every initiative we propose
2206547 what are you supposed to do to do right by the people
2206548 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try and take away health care from people
2206549 now the governor by doing this risks us not getting anything at all
2206550 many of us are getting sick and tired of this little game it is hurting people
2206551 get to work stop making excuses and earn your pay
2206552 we can do this if you want but i trust where youre going with the character
2206553 it wasnt the denver nuggets it was the usa team we were at our lowest point in the world now we have a chance to be at the highest place in the world
2206554 robert downey that dude he never left character the whole time he was black the whole time
2206555 my mom came up to the set she thought he was don cheadle
2206556 im serious he would keep going man when director ben stiller would yell cut hed be like im going back to my trailer and listen to hip hop and kanye west if you all want to come
2206557 i had to audition like 15 times ben thought i was way too young for it so at first i didnt get the part and they went to an older actor actually it was a rapper a real rapper but they found it wasnt working with him so they called me
2206558 stay working but its tough pace yourself man dont burn out too quick cause you can easily
2206559 i want to have children please god with a woman that i love and that im very attracted to
2206560 the post office does not receive a government subsidy for operations
2206561 why does a postal service meant to serve all americans need to turn a profit
2206562 certainly how long would you like us to hold it
2206563 oh no no i dont think you get me i want out permanently

2206565 the steepest u s housing market slump since the great depression
2206566 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit but frankly if i had perfect foresight i never would have taken this job in the first place
2206567 households in the mid quintile with a mean of one income earner per household had incomes between 36 000 and 57 657
2206568 so when will the american public come to its senses and demand major budget cuts and an end to the war
2206569 mexico and brazil now 2 of the top 10 creditors to us government
2206570 it takes up as much space as a flat panel
2206571 ive seen these guys refuse an 85 year old man trying to return his laser printer because he didnt have the right credit card with his receipt
2206572 geez you didnt even sell him a surge protector those things sell themselves
2206573 i have eight different bosses right now eight bob so that means that when i make a mistake i have eight different people coming by to tell me about it thats my only real motivation is not to be hassled that and the fear of losing my job but you know bob that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired
2206574 an oral contract is just as valid as a written agreement
2206575 i dont agree with the consumerist suggesting to never purchase an extended warranty
2206576 just randomly happens to be staffed with people who arent idiots
2206577 for quality and training purposes this call may be recorded
2206578 im extremely sorry but we dont allow returns on this item
2206579 well im so sorry but you see we have t too m many returns so we dont allow returns
2206580 im sorry sir but we are not even supposed to take this item back i am doing this as a favor to you
2206581 under the sale and supply of goods to consumers regulations 2002 any fault that arises during the first 6 months will be presumed to have existed at the time of delivery it is therefore up to the retailer to prove otherwise
2206582 let me share with you a lovely youtube video that demonstrates exactly what does not happen in ones quest to get published aside from the dancing the dancing is perfectly accurate
2206583 i have enjoyed working with james on building our first website not only were they very responsive but they tried to see things from my point of view which is helpful we love the way the site looks they were patient in working with me even though i know i was very confusing they helped us to realize our goal
2206584 i wouldnt let us sell the rights to our old shows that is why we are where we are today
2206585 to hear marty talk ive never worked a single day
2206586 sid i thought you were telling a story about land of the lost what happened to that
2206587 you know i can tell long stories too just the way you do
2206588 now this moment right now you decide you need to tell all of this
2206589 well marty i dont see the harm its history now
2206590 i was telling marty the other day how bad it is that some of his children even have heard it and believe it
2206591 my brother was getting 1 500 a week from judy garland and it cost 2 000 a week to travel the act
2206592 but always sid would spend what we made and more on the show
2206593 if we didnt put everything in the shows they wouldnt have been as good as they were thats all that people see whats up on the screen thats where the magic is
2206594 he told me the one thing to remember is dont ever sell anything you create and always put your name above the title whatever you do theyll fight you off from doing it but stick to it the only thing he didnt tell me was how to save money
2206595 i did it you might as well handcuff me and take me to jail
2206596 ive been trying to come up with something anything that would give me some idea whats going on here
2206597 but theres no point if i cant see him or whatever then im just stuck
2206598 it is pretty clear that when the money travels it travels back to the equity market whenever it can
2206599 were seeing a lot of asset allocation moving back and forth and right now investors dont need the safety of government bonds
2206600 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2206601 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2206602 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2206603 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2206604 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
2206605 not everybody gives them a chance and not everybody cares about them like i do
2206606 so it gives us opportunity to provide the type of instruction that you normally wouldnt get
2206607 my mom is happy for me she wants me to go to college and make something of myself
2206608 the day i make it is the day i look out for all the little people instead of all big people
2206609 i started to sit on the bench and my confidence went all the way down
2206610 the camp helped me out because i got a lot of playing time and i worked on my game and everybody was here to help me
2206611 theres not too many people that love to play the game like i do that have a passion for it i would come out here for four or five hours to play
2206612 tad said he would help me and thats what i really like about this program
2206613 the whole thing is dismantled retail is gone radio is gone ok now the records are gone it worries me about what his son and percussionist joachim is going to do im not worried for my sake we wont starve but its too bad
2206614 this mass of hundreds of thousands of defense workers and factory workers and people that liked their honky tonk music
2206615 i wouldve gotten von dutch to pinstripe my guitar or my lunchbox
2206616 it would have taken us 45 minutes to get there
2206617 no freeways in those days you dont want to go there my dad said so i never did
2206618 what are you going to say about the white lower class that merle travis didnt already say
2206619 the 60 percent protective effect against hiv acquisition over the first 24 months of the study we now find to be sustained and possibly strengthened to approximately 65 percent over three and a half years of follow up
2206620 these results further support the addition of male circumcision to our limited armamentarium of hiv prevention
2206621 how can they not think we are in it its a good sign
2206622 no one is running away with this division and this is only going to help us
2206623 we need to put our hands on him our eyes on him
2206624 i thought i made a great record to begin with
2206625 the record company atlantic wanted to put all summer long out last fall and we screamed at them you cannot do that
2206626 good music just doesnt go out of style and if you hear a great song that moves you youll obtain it by any means necessary
2206627 hes one of those artists that appeals to this huge wide audience the fans are young and old clubgoers and an older generation that enjoyed the raw rock of the eighties
2206628 its definitely interesting that hes the only artist thats not available on itunes with a monster hit right now and were seeing that kind of a growth
2206629 its certainly spurring a lot of debate in our company
2206630 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206631 das geht nur um den preis der industriellen substanz hessens
2206632 deshalb w ge und w hle genau wer verantwortung f r das land zu vergeben hat wem er sie anvertrauen kann
2206633 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206634 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206635 reported to the proper law enforcement authorities and charged with their heinous crimes
2206636 one sexual predator in our midst is one too many
2206637 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206638 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2206639 but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight
2206640 human rights are limited for those who have sexual relations with men they are not recognized as a valid group by law and many countries silence them and deny them their rights
2206641 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2206642 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2206643 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2206644 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2206645 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2206646 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2206647 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2206648 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2206649 paying attention to your credit is going to be paramount for people
2206650 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2206651 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2206652 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2206653 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2206654 but there is no peace and democracy in burma and its impossible to go home
2206655 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2206656 candor is the most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2206657 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2206658 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2206659 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2206660 the death of this boy signals the social decomposition which weve reached
2206661 mexico doesnt deserve this reality neither do the coming generations
2206662 this cowardly act demonstrates the urgency of putting a halt to these criminal bands
2206663 my son crossed paths with soulless men people for whom there are no words to describe
2206664 the problem is corruption collusion the relationship the police have with the kidnappers
2206665 filled many families with mourning because many families live with this problem of kidnapping in mexico
2206666 when society mobilizes the kidnappings have gone down obviously the authorities react
2206667 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2206668 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2206669 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
2206670 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2206671 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2206672 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2206673 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2206674 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2206675 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2206676 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a
2206677 im afraid like all fathers are afraid for their children its like all other sports its more dangerous than playing chess if thats considered a sport but i dont think its more dangerous than horseback riding and riding competitions
2206678 he killed his first animal at 6 he already has scars you dont teach a child to kill at age 6 the role of a parent is to protect their child these parents are not protecting their child they are making him take risks
2206679 i think he has a really great career ahead of him
2206680 gen mckiernan is in the best possible position to most efficiently and effectively deploy all of the resources to the benefit of the overall mission
2206681 this creates one commander in country and in charge of all forces and establishes a structure to deploy them as best suits the mission and to improve synchronization among all military assets
2206682 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
2206683 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206684 the synod decided the reinstatement of defrocked priest john theodore to the active priesthood and ministry of the church
2206685 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206686 the truly damaging scandals arise when church leaders mishandle these crises by failing to treat them with the gravity they deserve many in church authority have failed their calling and their congregations under similar conditions through defensiveness dissimulation and deferring hard decisions
2206687 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206688 you boys know what makes this bird go up funding makes this bird go up
2206689 while its going to be hard to underperform the s amp p over the next year the massive amounts of debt and poor earnings per share will depress this stocks price
2206690 i would get in after the restructuring of the debt
2206691 although the nra and i have certainly had our disagreements over the years i hope that we can agree that the gun violence prevention debate should be based upon an open and honest exchange of ideas not on underhanded tactics
2206692 one of the reasons we have lobbying disclosure rules is so the public knows whos lobbying the elected but also so the elected know whos coming before them and whos really paying them
2206693 a driver whos speeding may be trying to deliver to too many locations in too short a time
2206694 we can help the company restructure their routes to optimize their staffs it makes the fleet more productive and reduces fuel and overtime costs
2206695 the service isnt just about fuel costs but the price of gas helps you open the conversation
2206696 the big objections in our company were that nobody could tell exactly what this 40 per vehicle monitoring was going to do for us
2206697 but once we did the pilot project on 400 service trucks it was great we saved about 300 a vehicle after a year after two years the project paid for itself
2206698 we didnt spy on employees we told them upfront that we were verifying the use of company assets and if they werent abusing the assets they had nothing to worry about
2206699 if you know the slope of a highway through your vehicles navigation system you can reprogram the engine to optimize fuel consumption
2206700 they will mean a lot on one hand for the rest of the world to discover what china really is to discover a country that for most people of the world is a bit mysterious
2206701 they will see a country with a history and a tradition and a culture of 5 000 years they will see a fascinating country and i think this will change the perception of china throughout the world
2206702 you have to look at the goal of the chinese government which is not to gain international acceptance but to impress their domestic audience
2206703 and since they control 100 percent of the media i think they will achieve what they are looking to gain which is a series of images showing that they have brought the world to china
2206704 there is something about the undercurrent of excitement and anticipation here in beijing and certainly from what we read and hear from our friends back in the united states it feels as if were sitting on top of something special
2206705 what the olympics promote is a form of amoral universalism in which all countries are entitled to take part in the games no matter how barbaric their leaders may be
2206706 im not sure there has ever been an olympic games that will have had as big an impact as these games will have on china
2206707 they provide such a stage to present the host country to the world
2206708 nobody questions chinas future in the world politically socially economically but for the everyday man in the street theres not a lot known about china and these games will be a unique opportunity to present not only the sporting platform but cultural educational and social aspects
2206709 the genius of the olympics is that in theory it allows the chinese government to build its image domestically by means of improving chinas image internationally
2206710 its about helping the twin cities put on a better face i get to brag about it and its also an opportunity to serve
2206711 i went myself so that i wouldnt have to pay one of my guys to do the work
2206712 i hired kevin as the part time executive director of our parent organization when i was president of the kinship board
2206713 he supports our affiliates with training administration board development website resources troubleshooting and hes an engaging speaker our volunteers like him
2206714 but i put some money in the bank from the sale of previous businesses and im finally making a living in this business
2206715 hes sincere he gave volunteers a good overview of customer service how to be good listeners how to deal with challenging situations and to be appreciative these volunteers are our ambassadors
2206716 im grateful that you are so outspoken in talking to the church we need to really hear and respond to the tragedy of sexual abuse by the clergy as a former roman catholic priest and now a priest of the episcopal church im shocked at my own hardness of heart and the slow awareness of the tragedy of abuse let alone by the clergy its a kind of spiritual murder thanks for your clear understanding and peace in christ
2206717 he had a bounce in his step and the way he bowled this morning to andrew flintoff in the nets it can only work for us
2206718 i feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers and ive given a lot more responsibility to the batters to score some runs
2206719 if you are going to pick a guy like steve then that must mean that they englands selectors are going to see a future for him going forward to india and the ashes series
2206720 hes got lots of family and friends here praying for him and supporting him
2206721 i figured that in my position it shouldnt be kept a secret
2206722 notons donc que pour les fans de q une bonne distrib linux est un bon choix
2206723 tetapi ini tidak ada jadi saya dicopot dari jabatan saya dan dinonjobkan di dirlantas ntt
2206724 kalau benar alasan itu yang dipakai saya kira tidak adil karena keputusan pencopotan saya hanya berdasarkan dugaan dari pihak tertentu yang tidak bisa dibuktikan kebenarannya selama ini saya tidak pernah berkomentar soal mobil bermasalah di koran justeru orang orang yang diduga terlibat dalam kasus pemalsuan dokumen mobil itu yang berbicara banyak di koran kenapa orang lain yang melakukan kesalahan saya juga ikut jadi korban
2206725 i wouldnt want to be an apparel retailer in a mall today
2206726 continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2206727 so what turns the corner for consumers its a matter of time
2206728 well have to see some stability in housing were not expecting a rebound
2206729 that starts to give you a foundation for improvement going forward
2206730 while we have continued to implement price increases in this segment they have not been adequate to offset the higher input costs
2206731 an oversupply of turkey breast meat also kept pricing of commodity breast meat at a low level exacerbating the cost price differential
2206732 there is no way in hell that it should be that big
2206733 im miserable my husband is going into the field soon and my mother is coming id like to have this baby

2206760 the campaign has decided to seek federal judicial review of a decision that has troubling near term and long term ramifications for the constitutional rights of maine citizens
2206761 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office
2206762 places strict limits on the nature and extent of permissible regulation of ballot access by the states particularly in the context of state regulation of federal elections

2206767 as a free over the air broadcaster that depends on advertising revenue for income and over the decade weve owned the station weve not had the level of support we had projected
2206768 and as expenses increase advertising revenues had to increase commensurately
2206769 according to court records rep russell pearce strangled his wife
2206770 russell pearce is possessed of a violent temper and has from time to time hit and shoved the wife the last time being on february 3rd when he grabbed the wife by the throat and threw her down
2206771 to repeal the law which prevents them from hiring individuals who are in this country illegally
2206772 the republican party in this state has to decide if we want to be the republican party of john mccain and jon kyl or if we want to be the republican party of russell pearce
2206773 and the difference is that the russell pearce republican party is at its core xenophobic racist and exclusionary it is the john birch wing of the republican party i dont think that is the way for the republican party to remain in the majority in this state
2206774 unfortunately there is not a pleasant way to tell the voters who russell pearce really is
2206775 i dont think its productive it certainly has a negative effect on the voters
2206776 russell pearce is a dangerous harmful spokesman for the republican party
2206777 i think he and his ilk are directly responsible for the deteriorating image of the party and i think they are largely responsible for why we are losing statewide elections and why we used to have six congressman and now have four i think it all lands on their shoulders
2206778 i think nathan went over the edge with this latest attack you dont stoop to their level to try to defeat them
2206779 were looking at using this lander for all we can get out of it
2206780 we want to come up with the best we can do between now and the end of september thats our expectation
2206781 we are not at the point to slap each others backs and offer congratulations but we will be at that point by the end of the mission
2206782 i think it will go down as a great mission but we still have our jobs to do before that happens
2206783 the extended mission is very important for understanding the seasonal changes
2206784 its going to be very helpful to have more time to complete the analysis with the idea of using all eight tega ovens
2206785 were trying to become one of the top 10 research universities in the country and so you have a mission like this that is getting international attention people realize what is going on and say that this is the place to come and do scientific research
2206786 i think this is going to be a huge boon for tucson and the university
2206787 in return were trying to get another project so we can keep the ball rolling
2206788 there are other opportunities coming in the future as always at the moment the next available mission to mars in 2016
2206789 once the sun sets the amount of energy the solar panels produce obviously goes down the temperatures go down when the sun goes down so the energy we have to use of that restricted resource goes up to keep the temperatures high enough so we dont freeze
2206790 so all these things combine to the point that we believe by the time we get to the end of september we are going to be down to about 350 watt hours per sol so we wont be able to aggressively do what we have been doing
2206791 it doesnt mean we wont be able to continue to operate
2206792 it just means we will have to slow down a bit on what we are doing on a sol to sol basis

2206794 faced with a weak economy and increasing energy costs many mainers are having a tough time making ends meet
2206795 the purpose of these rebate checks was to get people to spend more money and when they spend their payments here in maine that will help our local economy
2206796 most of these people are seniors who are not required to file for any reason other than to get their stimulus payment so they may not realize they qualify and because they may not have filed a tax return in decades they may find the process intimidating
2206797 we need to get the word out that people have until oct 15 to claim the payment and that they can get help in applying
2206798 many of the seniors who havent filed yet are home bound and may need special assistance
2206799 family members and friends should check in with the seniors they know to make sure theyre aware they can qualify for the payment and get the help they need
2206800 the sole effect of the artificial snow is on the tribes subjective spiritual experience
2206801 a government action that decreases the spirituality the fervor or the satisfaction with which a believer practices his religion is not what congress has labeled a substantial burden on the free exercise of religious freedom
2206802 in a nation that prides itself on religious freedom and rights for all it should be intolerable that it is good for everyone except native americans
2206803 what we have is generally a bunch of non natives becoming arbiters of indian religion which is not the role of the court
2206804 i dont know what the repercussions are in terms of 2014
2206805 we have to reconfigure and move forward how i dont know yet

2206809 we have just been overwhelmed by the positive response of our business community
2206810 we are surprised by it encouraged by it and we are going to seize on it
2206811 they could have asked for a motion to reconsider the findings
2206812 its something we wouldnt do if we didnt think we had a legitimate reason to do so
2206813 all the evidence presented to the court demonstrated that gonzales was not competent to stand trial and could not be restored to competency within 21 months
2206814 some schools when they felt it wasnt working for them went back to mojave student management system
2206815 when they did it definitely slowed the process and gave them less time for doing schedules
2206816 find out what the kids needs are and then build the school schedule to their needs instead of building it first and plugging kids into it
2206817 teachers told us i know im going to teach math im a math teacher
2206818 that doesnt give them much time to prepare for those classes and a lot of people do prepare during the summer
2206819 then we ran into the president of the choir and she hadnt gotten in either
2206820 but once we got in it took her about 10 minutes to completely correct the schedule
2206821 s az man who filmed sex with children gets shot in the forehead
2206822 we really think this is a much better system than meters
2206823 very few credit cards were used at city hall stations near ua are running 50 50
2206824 you pay and it gives you a ticket and you put it in your car they dont print tickets in tucson but for me its cool
2206825 one person came up and said he hated it but when he found out he didnt have to go back to his car he thought it was ok
2206826 they need to make them so they take a dollar bill credit card thats taking too much a chance
2206827 i can tell you space 25 at city hall has only 15 minutes left
2206828 how will you stand out in the crowd and get the scoop no one else can
2206829 i get a 50 50 chance to see the next president since im covering the republican convention ill get to see president bush and i get a real chance to start my career
2206830 seeing the work ethic that goes on behind this job
2206831 i think we get to sit in the nbc box so seeing all those people there ill be learning from the best
2206832 one of the great things about being in a democracy is you cant have too many perspectives
2206833 citizen journalists can bring the psychology of the individual voters mind set into their reports not just the collective opinions of groups
2206834 its tough its tight but this is typical of the smuggling organizations
2206835 i thank god for this golden opportunity afforded me to be part of this online program honestly speaking it has been a great benefit to me not only taking this course but the exposure to online education the experience has been great and i do appreciate the great work ntc is doing i will encourage many of my people to get involved in this program

2206838 we come to celebrate our heritage and our centennial anniversary as a church this gathering was like a family reunion a big fiesta time i am encouraged about the future of the hispanic latino church in the usa and canada we have a saying que la fiesta siga let the fiesta continue in making christlike disciples in the nations
2206839 the ministry to hispanics started as a result of a godly woman named may mcreynolds and the passion god gave her for ministry to the mexican community in the pasadena and los angeles area we pray that god will continue to place his passion in the hearts of hispanics as we celebrate the past and future of the church of the nazarene
2206840 our building is battered but god reigns and we will grow closer and stronger through this we are still blessed
2206841 to make disciples of the caribbean nations by intentionally engage our culture with the gospel of jesus christ while equipping and empowering our regional church people and structure with the resources that would facilitate holiness evangelism that is prayerfully compassionate
2206842 while the doctors say theres nothing they can do i know theres definitely something god can do
2206843 everyone and everything will have frustrations but other things overtake that
2206844 god called me into a deeper relationship with himself and helped me understand that he could and would use me for ministry to others
2206845 i love getting up in front of people speaking and preaching
2206846 to reach as many people for god as i can and to make the biggest difference in this world for god that i can
2206847 i hope i can give hope and inspiration to the people around me
2206848 despite losing sight and having the disease i feel that anything that comes my way i can defeat
2206849 the training seminar the first of its kind in malawi was very timely it dealt with topics and issues that we are experiencing in malawi which need some new techniques in this 21st century
2206850 every participant left very excited about what god is doing in the church of the nazarene in malawi

2206854 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2206855 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2206856 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2206857 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2206858 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in
2206859 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2206860 we cant keep going back at it with pakistan cmon man where would that leave us
2206861 weve done war were in a different place now its not about india pakistan
2206862 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
2206863 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
2206864 we know the promise is weak but there is relatively little india can do short of military action and we do not have the stomach for that
2206865 danger is everywhere but i have to live my life
2206866 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2206867 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged

2206876 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2206877 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2206878 a good and a positive step in the right direction
2206879 the biggest shiite threat to both the iraqi government and the u s led coalition

2206881 we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2206882 there has been some dissent among militiamen when the news first broke about the momahidoun army
2206883 but what muqtada says always turns out at the end to be good
2206884 a major disruption to transnational organised crime both in this country and abroad
2206885 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation there have been 10 000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this worlds largest seizure and importation into our country
2206886 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2206887 there are not many boardrooms in australia where you would write off half a billion dollars worth of a commodity or a product and continue your business
2206888 what we have to do is reach out to the youth of the country and reduce demand

2206891 the politicians put a set of policies in motion but what happens on the street they have no control over
2206892 as long the turkish state insists on this war such actions will justifiably be expanded
2206893 we believe these actions carried out against economic resources have a deterring effect on its war to destroy the kurdish people
2206894 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices

2206897 were working with apple to get netshare back up on the app store
2206898 theyve raised awareness in the marketplace about what smart phones can do

2206902 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2206903 hi im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2206904 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
2206905 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
2206906 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2206907 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2206908 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2206909 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2206910 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2206911 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2206912 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2206913 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2206914 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
2206915 were all on the same journey you can choose to do it with joy
2206916 t he cubs have got smart smart people here i mean theyre winning theyre doing great things ill just stay out of the way

2206923 holy shit did you see that snake i just ran over
2206924 out on the roads there is fitness and self discovery and the persons we were destined to be
2206925 people always say that as if its a good thing
2206926 and of course that is what all of this is all of this the one song ever changing ever reincarnated that speaks somehow from and to and for that which is ineffable within us and without us that is both prayer and deliverance folly and wisdom that inspires us to dance or smile or simply to go on senselessly incomprehensibly beatifically in the face of mortality and the truth that our lives are more ill writ ill rhymed and fleeting than any song except perhaps those songs that song endlesly reincarnated born of that truth be it the moon and june of that truth or the wordless blue moan or the rotgut or the elegant poetry of it that nameless black hulled ship of ulysses that long black train that terraplane that mystery train that rocket 88 that buick 6 same journey same miracle same end and endlessness
2206927 im always on to my next film and beyond that
2206928 i never get bogged down in what audiences think or what critics think or what friends think or anything because if i did id be paralyzed i try and keep my mind completely blank and not think at all about what i do
2206929 has a natural flowing vitality to it a sun drenched splendor that never falters
2206930 thats exactly the point of the picture really that you are who you are and you are always going to be who you are
2206931 since moneys always a factor with me in getting films financed i said sure
2206932 it wasnt that they were asking me to make a film in the sudan orc something barcelona is a great city
2206933 then i started to play around with it and think about it and get some ideas and discard some ideas and finally came up with it
2206934 you reach a certain point where you just simply know and you have great confidence and you have great trust in the actors that you have hired and you dont have to second guess yourself when youre woody allen you know what youre doing obviously its a remarkably non neurotic set but you do have to be prepared
2206935 i felt that i was actually making a foreign film that i was making an american film but basically it was foreign when i look at the film i get a personal pride out of the fact that it looks to me like one of those films that i grew up liking
2206936 i never felt there was ever anything to be rejuvenated from
2206937 i thought that some of the best films i did from my point of view were anything else and hollywood ending
2206938 ive done so many films in new york city that when they see the people walking in central park and eating out at those restaurants and living in those apartments automatically it gives it a feeling of well weve been here before but when they look up and see the streets of london and the london countryside and the spanish countryside theres automatically a freshness that they feel even though the pictures the same
2206939 the only thing that stands between me and greatness is me
2206940 ive made many films and from my first film to my last film ive always had complete 100 percent control over everything no one gets to read the script i cast who i want i write about what i want its a complete carte blanche for me and so i have no one to blame at all when i dont live up to expectations when i do a poor job or a mediocre job or dont make a great film i still feel you know ive never made a film that could stand next to what we consider the great films grand illusion or rashomon or things like that
2206941 ive never thought oh this is the one that if fellini and akira kurosawa and bergman could see this they would just be open mouthed
2206942 i never have that feeling its usually the cold shower feeling i look at it and think oh god what did i do
2206943 and once in a while i get a better feeling
2206944 i saw it and i thought well its close to what i set out to make
2206945 what still surprises me in the movie business is the enormous enthusiasm and enjoyment people get out of unmitigated garbage
2206946 in life what surprises me is that there are any decent people given how terrifying and difficult it is how people cope with it at all
2206947 im very surprised that there are people that actually affirm it
2206948 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
2206949 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
2206950 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
2206951 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
2206952 she wants it all and yet like many women shes like im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us i think shes a little disillusioned
2206953 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
2206954 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
2206955 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
2206956 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
2206957 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
2206958 she was playing she knew what they were doing on the other side of that mirror
2206959 she was taking the control back instead of being the victim she wasnt being slutty she was being confident and sexual that was one of my favorite scenes it was one of the best revealing moments for joan and i also just love the dynamic of men and women on either side of that glass i think it sums up a lot about mad men in particular what goes on in the office
2206960 wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
2206961 but she is nice thats her roommate and joan likes her
2206962 i think i understand now youre actually trying to be nice
2206963 every other girl came in here and listened to what i had to say youre not the first girl to be walked around the office and told what to do every other girl is doing that and been just fine

2206974 the doctors were really like that they would treat you like a child and talk to your husband
2206975 youve got to go in there and be like this and be like that

2206982 thats not to say were not getting phone calls from their agents saying theyre huge now and were respectful of that were not expecting anyone to do it because they owe us there are actors that have come to some prominence theyre helping us out because they want to do it
2206983 starting before the events of the miniseries our story focuses on familiar characters including cylon number one known as cavil stockwell resistance leader sam t anders trucco and chief galen tyrol douglas
2206984 in the beginning the cylons had a plan but it didnt account for one thing survivors during the chaotic aftermath of the destruction two powerful cylon agents struggle with plots and priorities on the human ships that got away and among the resistance fighters who were left behind

2206989 solid growth for the prominent apple 3g iphone driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
2206990 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
2206991 somehow the fact that i didnt share their convictions must mean that im an
2206992 he came in here bouncing around the room and said lets have a lot of fun
2206993 its a new system for him so id give him the play and bubba franks served as a translator
2206994 ill be doing some teaching now but before long it will be all learning from favre
2206995 i picked up on it pretty fast and bretts a smarter guy than i am
2206996 i was very much looking forward to approaching this season like i was going to play on sunday but well roll with it
2206997 but you dont get an opportunity to play with a legend too often
2206998 will mainstream science ever be prepared to admit that psychic phenomena warrants serious investigation
2206999 a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it
2207000 as far as the jets are concerned i think its an extremely smart business decision both on and off the field
2207001 i want to get a good one a nice official one

2207004 youve got a better chance of securing deals when your quarterbacks last name is favre
2207005 i think we had been at an impasse for quite a while
2207006 i think we didnt think he would show up to camp and they didnt think we wanted him to come to camp so in any negotiation there has to come a pressure point and i think the pressure point was him being reinstated and coming up here
2207007 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
2207008 in this case frankly i dont have all the answers i never have
2207009 my first blush guess is probably communication breakdowns when one group of people are in mississippi sometimes you think that everybody understands where everybody is
2207010 you probably will have to talk to people around him and develop a myriad of sources to find out whats really going on with brett favre
2207011 you may have to go to everybody around him to get the truth and know whats on his mind
2207012 if he doesnt like a play call dont be surprised if you see an interception he may throw it up there for grabs
2207013 we had no answer for the safety blitz and brett was ticked so he threw it up there
2207014 when youre in one system for so long you can get brainwashed and its difficult to unlearn it but i think brett will be able to do it he knows six and seven man protections the terminology might be different but he knows schematics and philosophies
2207015 itll be an adjustment for brett but the coaches will have to adjust as well if they dont know how because of their youth and inexperience thats where it could bog down
2207016 i think theyre very similar in many ways the teaching by brian would be very much like the teaching with mike mccarthy so theres a benefit to that because theres a connection

2207026 the dog gets a peculiar reaction he crawls under the table stays away from the dark leaps out at imaginary objects and as far as one can interpret may be having hallucinations

2207044 just so grateful theyve been able to find him and that hes well
2207045 from the beginning of the investigation there were five options and we had to go through all those options
2207046 we are still investigating but it would appear that he wasnt missing or ran away he was actually being hidden
2207047 it would appear that he was there of his own free will and he knew that person he was staying with
2207048 therell have to be a full moon tonight and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2207049 the small size of the territorys electorates and the impact of the recent redistribution of electoral boundaries means a handful of votes will determine the outcome
2207050 the last three elections have shown that there have been massive swings in seats that have not been seen to be vulnerable at all
2207051 the general view is and ive been listening to the pollsters over the last few days is that labor will be returned
2207052 and the part of that that is the unknown there seems to be a view that we will lose seats i personally cant see that
2207053 i couldnt believe it i went to follow and there it was sitting up on bricks
2207054 its just an ordinary holden wagon a few years old nothing special so i hope they got their kicks using my wheels for their street drags or whatever and leaving me stranded

2207056 hayley is a midwife and nurse at sunshine and you just cant believe people would do this in a hospital car park
2207057 the granting of an injunction to restrain the defendants conduct abroad is not futile if the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction and his assets are within the jurisdiction
2207058 the presence of assets in the jurisdiction means that if the injunction is not complied with by the defendant it will be open to the plaintiff to seek an order for their seizure
2207059 central to the structure of rugby league and our future plans
2207060 the survey fits with what has been going on with singles for a long time but the question is why
2207061 certainly it is the singles who are depressed who commit suicide at much higher rates
2207062 my feeling is society is stuck in this transitional stage between coupledom and singledom and its range of other options but for some people they dont adjust to the single state
2207063 this survey missed a whole group of people whereas what we see in society now is that after age 45 the kids have not left home they are still a financial drain
2207064 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2207065 we were told to trust nobody we were warned that there is going to be a huge spy presence in beijing and that we should expect to be followed wherever we go
2207066 no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
2207067 the british security services seem particularly worried about the chinese hotel staff going into our bedrooms
2207068 we were told they will find an excuse to go into our room five or more times a day theyll say theyve come to change the free slippers but actually theyll be on the lookout for any phones or documents we might have left lying around
2207069 in order to ensure the smooth opening of the olympics in beijing it is required that your company install and run the security management system
2207070 one group is responsible for the audiences feelings like leading them to cheer politely or applaud appropriately during matches the other group is in charge of organising primary or middle school students to be the audience for the matches that are less popular

2207072 we were given 12 and told to come back in two months
2207073 quils ont tous vouloir minviter au resto en ce moment
2207074 we are all longing to go home to some place we have never been a place half remembered and half envisioned we can only catch glimpses of from time to time community somewhere there are people to whom we can speak with passion without having the words catch in our throats somewhere a circle of hands will open to receive us eyes will light up as we enter voices will celebrate with us whenever we come into our own power someplace where we can be free

2207083 why do people push their shopping carts the same stupid way they drive
2207084 it also means keeping your momentum going toward the goal
2207085 but mostly our music is about pulling together to make things stronger to make things better
2207086 we wouldnt do five or six guitar tracks for one song because we cant reproduce that live but well try any type of music from metal to blues and stephen knows whats up
2207087 we love to work hard and have a good time doing it

2207090 women with olympian physical stamina cast iron immune systems and steel clad nerves and sensitivities
2207091 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
2207092 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness
2207093 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
2207094 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
2207095 and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
2207096 marsha was baptized confirmed and married and received her first communion all in about thirty minutes
2207097 i was never so happy as that day she recalls and i remember telling you how extraordinary it was to take communion at last and you spoke about communion as coming together in an incomparable way with god in such a complete loving way
2207098 in case you wonder this almost intuitive sense of the centrality of the mass and communion is far from being uncommon among prospective catholics another woman formerly an evangelical protestant and now an enthusiastic catholic says that when she was looking into the church she quickly realized that if she could settle the issue of the eucharist then eventually all the other things the infallibility of the pope praying to mary and the saints and the rest would fall into place and they did when you think about what mass and communion are that stands to reason
2207099 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners
2207100 who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father
2207101 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
2207102 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness
2207103 because you didnt serve hashem your g d with joy you will end up serving your enemies
2207104 por qu fui tan ciego o ciega ante todo esto

2207117 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
2207118 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2207119 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
2207120 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
2207121 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2207122 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2207123 reminding them of the campaign finance law and providing some information as to how to get a refund if thats what they desire
2207124 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
2207125 people always make allegations in lawsuits its purely a commercial dispute
2207126 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2207127 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2207128 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2207129 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2207130 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2207132 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2207133 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2207134 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2207135 if its such earth shattering stuff whats been going on since 2005
2207136 why is he on the street if they think its that important
2207137 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2207138 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2207139 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person

2207141 i dont pay for coffee i am an officer i get coffee for free
2207142 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2207143 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2207144 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2207145 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2207146 we wanted to create a womens boot line that lives up to irish setters reputation of fit and performance these boots live up to that reputation and while they meet our high standards for field performance they also have styling to highlight their feminine nature
2207147 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2207148 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
2207149 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
2207150 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2207151 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things

2207157 the aftershock could be felt in many places in sichuan the sina com website reported
2207158 all sides should bring an immediate end to the violence and engage in direct talks to resolve this matter peacefully
2207159 the georgian leadership has resorted to very aggressive actions in south ossetia in fact it started warfare using heavy armour and artillery
2207160 this is very sad and this will incur a response
2207161 restoring peace in south ossetia and defending the local civilian population within the peacekeeping mandate we have
2207162 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
2207163 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
2207164 all sides should bring an immediate end to the violence and engage in direct talks to resolve this matter peacefully
2207165 obey your parents in the lord for this is right
2207166 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long upon the land which the lord your god is giving you
2207167 the eye that mocks his father and scorns obedience to his mother the ravens of the valley will pick it out and the young eagles will eat it
2207168 if a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and who when they have chastened him will not heed them
2207169 and they shall say to the elders of his city this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard
2207170 then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones so you shall put away the evil from among you and all israel shall hear and fear
2207171 for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found
2207172 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2207173 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2207174 those who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2207175 probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing

2207191 i reiterated to premier wen jiabao the extent to which all australians had been moved by the huge loss of life this extraordinary natural calamity which affected so many people and communities throughout sichuan province

2207193 tokbox has an impressive and very loyal and energetic user base
2207194 the company is executing well and its service offers consumers a variety of great features that strongly differentiate tokbox from competitors we are excited to be investing with our partners at seqouia in a company we believe has the potential to be the next big thing in web communication
2207195 weve successfully changed the pattern here and also at peter mac peter maccallum cancer centre
2207196 a year and a half after the debut of facebooks web site it was built by copying the look feel and features of facebook com
2207197 facebook is concerned that because studivz looks like facebook and incorporates similar features and functionality to facebook users will incorrectly believe that studivz is associated with facebook
2207198 kamco is currently conducting a series of environmental tests at train stations
2207199 the tests are confirming and testing the functionality of the devices in the field
2207200 it is still very early days of testing and no definitive test results are available yet
2207201 the ticketing authority will release the results of the tests at an appropriate time
2207202 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2207203 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2207204 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2207205 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there
2207206 we know there are customers more oriented to a direct branch service that is more innovative and direct
2207207 our platforms are able to deliver what we need right now but theyre not sufficient to underpin our future growth strategy
2207208 weve had all my business colleagues a technology sub committee chaired by andrew thorburn and the board and group executives involved
2207209 it has been an incredibly inclusive process and this is a unanimous decision
2207210 one of our key sustainable outperformance strategies is to make sure were very well buttoned up on our quality of service initiatives
2207211 as the leader of the free world president bush should use the bully pulpit to remind leaders in china and elsewhere that basic human rights to life liberty and property pre exist the state and that a just governments role is to safeguard those sacred rights the best way to help china move toward a freer society is to continue on the path of economic engagement and not surrender to protectionist forces the u s should practice what it preaches
2207212 we must trust in god and put the people in gods hand and pray just pray for them
2207213 the reality on any major college campus is that the lines between for profit and not for profit are blurring as these worlds come together with companies renting mini refrigerators or running the bookstores
2207214 what universities are really good at is the creation and delivery of undergraduate and graduate curriculum kaplans skill is understanding the needs of foreign students and the complexities and differences of higher education systems
2207215 the resources to develop the infrastructure to sustain recruiting overseas
2207216 the cost of higher education is increasing so rapidly theres no end i can see
2207217 we must protect ourselves for that day when the competition for tuition dollars is going to get rougher
2207218 were not a wealthy institution we dont have a large endowment
2207219 a great deal if not all of studivzs success is due to its copying and misusing of facebooks intellectual property
2207220 facebook may have the superior technology but it doesnt have the users in germany
2207221 this lawsuit is an attempt to encourage holtzbrinck to sell studivz
2207222 i know the two companies met several times to discuss this and that offers were made by facebook
2207223 because it uses observations to demonstrate the sensitivity of extreme rainfall to temperature
2207224 in the u s flooding is a greater cause of death than lightning or tornadoes and presumably poses similar risks elsewhere
2207225 i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2207226 you shouldnt even be riding in a car with a guy named white
2207227 if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in the seat what would i do
2207228 residents can be assured government will continue to operate as usual
2207229 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
2207230 what ultimately happened in spite of the system was justice
2207231 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed
2207232 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2207233 giving bob casey jr a role at the convention says all that in fewer words
2207234 indeed it makes tangible the most important message the democrats could possibly hope to convey to catholics since the senators dad was wrongfully denied the platform in 1992 and maybe since robert f kennedy welcome home
2207235 should say the united states will hunt you down and give you a harsh but appropriate sentence if you provide material support for terrorism
2207236 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
2207237 what ultimately happened in spite of the system was justice
2207238 this is a tragic day for firefighters everywhere and the people of california are profoundly aware of the tremendous sacrifices these heroes and their families make day in and day out to keep us safe we are praying for the swift recovery of the victims and our hearts go out to their loved ones
2207239 any time anybody gets hurt on a fire you feel it
2207240 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
2207241 its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when i am being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home so i dont spread the pestilence
2207242 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away
2207243 that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2207244 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2207245 if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in the seat what would i do
2207246 residents can be assured government will continue to operate as usual
2207247 they are less wear and tear on your body and they are enough of a challenge i can actually race those because i know my body can handle the mileage
2207248 id like to do two this year and if i can do it in two weeks that would be great
2207249 my pace is faster for a half marathon than a 10k
2207250 ive had the benefit of great equipment having the same crew chief and crew for three years and having fedex as a sponsor from the beginning
2207251 as a young driver coming into the series i know i have been really fortunate to have that consistency all around me
2207252 if we keep doing the same things weve been doing then the points will take care of themselves
2207253 last time in pocono we ran in the top five to top 10 the whole race but strategy didnt play in our favor
2207254 we ended up taking home a 12th place finish when i think we could have finished in the top 10
2207255 strategy is where jimmy elledge shines though hes just good at knowing the right strategy at the right times good at knowing how to get your car up front and once you get up front its a lot easier to stay there
2207256 the art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe
2207257 vatican splendors from st peters basilica the vatican museums and the swiss guard
2207258 its going to be horrible if the red sox make it
2207259 youd probably see every free agent pitcher signed by the yankees
2207260 those are monster bats taken away from your lineup not just good bats
2207261 then we lost wang our ace our horse but everyone has injuries weve got to find a way to get it done
2207262 id rather we were doing better but im pretty happy that weve put ourselves in a position to make a run at this thing
2207263 theyve been so great for so long you cant count them out even now they have alex rodriguez derek jeter bobby abreu and johnny damon you cant ever count that lineup out with mariano rivera
2207264 i think like any other manager who doesnt make it hell be scrutinized
2207265 joe torre had tons of injuries last year too and he was under the gun every day
2207266 the yankees organization doesnt make excuses every year when i was there their reply was it doesnt matter whos hurt you have to find a way to do it if you dont meet those standards they dont like whats going on
2207267 theyve got a lot of veterans over there who know how to win
2207268 his potential is endless hes recognizing pitches out of the pitchers hand a lot better and hes able to drive balls as opposed to hitting home runs and striking out hes swinging at strikes he isnt chasing pitches
2207269 when he was struggling he was chasing fastballs up and sliders in the dirt now even with two strikes hes a different kind of hitter theres not very many guys i make sure i get a good seat for when theyre batting but hes fun to watch
2207270 i feel like i still have a few good years left
2207271 i understand the different situations i try to think like a manager
2207272 instead of using torres money to buy dread hats for the kids why cant mccourt donate the hats and then the hospital can use torres money for something else for the kids why let mccourt ultimately make the money back
2207273 with sales stabilizing we should go back to positive zip codes
2207274 projecting the future economic and 7 5 months is an incredibly owner broker of cozumel
2207275 250 is a bargain considering the quality and features of ee
2207276 if my company produces 50 ee sites per year thats 12 500 year
2207277 250 is a bargain considering the quality and features of ee
2207278 if my company produces 50 ee sites per year thats 12 500 year
2207279 shortly after midnight we got call patrol deputies got called to the scene of a shooting upon arrival they found a male deceased in a vehicle it appears at this time that it is a domestic dispute between a girlfriend boyfriend we have a female that we are talking to she is in custody at this time and the investigation is in the early stages and were not sure of the charges and or anything it is still under investigation but it looks like its going to be a homicide
2207280 dance music has always been seen as a second class citizen in the music world here
2207281 the biggest prob lem is theres no real support for dance music on the radio or in the media like there is in europe especially in england
2207282 its elevator music in england and here you cant even get 400 people in a club to come listen to it it didnt even catch on in baltimore like it did in d c
2207283 youve got a lot of embassy kids who are here because of the nature of the government work
2207284 its a more cosmopolitan international mix of people theyre coming with an exposure to dance music and an expectation of a club experience thats different than we normally have in baltimore
2207285 these will be basic tools that we would use for any emergency
2207286 being able to get all of this equipment and all the training to learn how to operate it has just been a phenomenal asset
2207287 thats going to affect wisconsin in our ability to complete some projects that have been ongoing for a number of years and to start some new projects that are needs and are priorities throughout the state
2207288 the ability for emergency responders to come on that scene and to communicate immediately is critical
2207289 we wanted to use these funds this year to help local communities connect to a proposed state wide system
2207290 with a 14 percent cut there are simply fewer funds to help local communities to connect to a state wide system
2207291 it having the equipment benefits not just madison but it benefits this whole area i think
2207292 the interstate backup showed that thats a very high priority and we have to do whatever we have to do in the state to make sure it doesnt happen again and so obviously we hoped that we had as much federal money as we can get but if not were going to have to do it as a state
2207293 since 9 11 the state homeland security grant program has been a valuable program for san diego allowing us to drastically improve this regions readiness for both man made and natural disasters
2207294 wikis are ideal for capturing and collaborating on subjects that are already known such as existing policies documentation and best practices
2207295 but discussion forums provide a way to quickly gather opinions and ideas from everyone in an organization so that you can make more informed decisions you can engage people in a way that is different than wikis or blogs
2207296 in keeping our promise to offer collaboration software that is easy to use and innovative we have also created an easy way to ask and answer questions within forums
2207297 our answer approval capability allows an organization to streamline the most critical of all activities make decisions
2207298 the additional dollars going directly to each of our 21 counties will result in additional equipment programs and training for first responders to better protect our people and our critical facilities
2207299 it is a positive sign that our funding level is approaching where we believe it should be but we still insist that fort dix and mcguire air force base being located in our county should be included in the formula and be considered critical facilities
2207300 we never would have been able to afford these projects without the support of the federal government and homeland security
2207301 we have an army of volunteers about 100 and that kind of volunteerism personifies the spirit of lewiston
2207302 more than weve ever had over 200 were closing off two blocks of center street the first time weve ever done that and putting the artists right on the street
2207303 its easy to get carried away every local school is invited and some use it as part of the lesson plan well have 30 students this time in 3 student teams and each team gets an 8 by 10 foot rectangle in which to work
2207304 this administration has aggressively pursued federal funding because of mercer countys unique concentration of important interstate highways railways and other transportation hubs
2207305 we plan to use this money to increase our capability to handle a natural disaster or other incident
2207306 so we believe they were trying to package it for sale
2207307 the art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe
2207308 the circumstances of mannys final hours with the red sox
2207309 there might have been a renegotiation with the red sox in the future
2207310 mannys only leverage was withholding services and playing at half speed so thats what he did he made sure the red sox knew he could not be trusted to play hard if they kept him until the end of the season with the options intact
2207311 but as far as we can tell it was not a manipulation of the system
2207312 we worked with them to make sure our underlying network to ensure it can match the potential of the adsl2
2207313 if you put adsl2 on a network that cant handle it then youre not going to get the speed or the throughput youre effectively strangling the service
2207314 remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
2207315 you get a boost like that you start playing better
2207316 it always feels better to drive in runs when the person in front of you gets walked
2207317 they were chasing my fastball up so i used that a lot today
2207318 were seeing a negative trend going from 31st to potentially worse and youre talking about one of the wealthiest states in the country going from mediocre to bad
2207319 the rate got better for white babies but worse for african american babies
2207320 maryland has a sizable uninsured population and a sizable population in the lower socioeconomic range i think that explains a lot of it
2207321 i think one of the problems is that women have insurance when they are pregnant then they lose it after they have the baby which means that theyre out of care so they have to get plugged back in when theyre pregnant again
2207322 women need access to health care just as women not just as mothers
2207323 panorama of congress st portland maine september 2007 with the baxter building circa 1901 inkjet print the image is about 6 feet long and really fun to study for a while klett has published a book of his work
2207324 i got away with some pitches tonight but overall i thought i threw well
2207325 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
2207326 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
2207327 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
2207328 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
2207329 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
2207330 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2207331 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2207332 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2207333 being the observant person that i am i watch them anyway
2207334 the government thinks i could be apart of the first line of defense
2207335 it is important that people who work in the industry when they see something suspicious they feel comfortable calling
2207336 maybe that one incident doesnt bring actionable intelligence but that combined with other intel can piece together the puzzle
2207337 our goals are certainly to sell a couple thousand units this year alone
2207338 this is a device that we had purchased a few years ago to deliver noninvasive respiratory support to our patients more particularly the premature babies although weve used it in all types of populations
2207339 it has reduced our need for invasive respiratory support resulting in less complications and lower chronic lung disease rates
2207340 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2207341 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint
2207342 that introduced huge amounts of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere and subsequently us
2207343 i dont look like as if anything is different with me but i might have trouble saying or seeing something
2207344 nf is a common genetic condition which is underrecognized by both physicians and the public
2207345 all those patients dont have a voice and often feel very self conscious and misunderstood
2207346 i sometimes feel electricity shooting down my body just completely unexpected
2207347 i cant deal with most people the rudeness people have the outright pointing staring screwed up face while looking at me
2207348 when i go out i need to have my guard on im ready for a comment or a look and thats why i have my cards
2207349 its not recommended procedure because there are just too many to remove
2207350 and it may not be worth the risk of sensory and nerve damage
2207351 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
2207352 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
2207353 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
2207354 in five short months the bush administration will be done
2207355 were in indiana were campaigning with the most popular politician in indiana
2207356 the architecture qualification pages on wiki debian org are still missing a lot of information
2207357 theres a small group of senior forwards who have made a pact and what has happened to sammy is part of their rules its a case of short sharp pain for long term gain youve got to send the right message to everyone the biggest penalty you can have when you are dropped from a team is to be stopped from playing footy
2207358 once the network information is distributed potential bidders will have 12 weeks to craft their proposals
2207359 it provides proponents with certainty over the information that will be provided the time line in which this will occur and arrangements to safeguard the information
2207360 the government has already received a significant amount of information from telstra that it is ready to provide to proponents this can occur when proponents have certified appropriate security arrangements are in place
2207361 now its time to get this show on the road and as quickly as possible reap the productivity benefits that this broadband network will bring to australia
2207362 we have no problem with the elected leaders on this its the bureaucracy that has the whole country in heath robinson land and is causing delay
2207363 true to form the rudd government is attempting to promote a very small step as some type of major activity in a bid to mask the policy silence and hide senator conroys broadband mess and broken election promises
2207364 the reality is this should have occurred months ago the lack of nbn progress is only matched by the lack of clarity and transparency in the decision making process and this is the problem when you have a sound bite without the supporting sound public policy
2207365 despite the global credit crunch theres been no shortage of banks willing to invest and were thrilled with that
2207366 to commit 4 7 billion without a competitive tender process would be reckless
2207367 there will be a huge cost to the whole australian economy if australia gets this decision wrong
2207368 we have identified a clear opportunity to leverage products and support areas in optuss business division to speed up the small and medium business expansion
2207369 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010
2207370 we will see how the timetable of the it transformation is going and how many customers have been moved onto the new system telstra is trying to become leaner
2207371 the major driver of top line growth continues to be wireless data and the mobiles division
2207372 they will come back with another impressive set of results
2207373 right up until yesterday morning we were still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2207374 however despite all our efforts we just werent able to bring it across the line i didnt expect to be told what i was told yesterday afternoon
2207375 once again i am so sorry that we werent able to nail the plan we announced in january time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2207376 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2207377 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any liklehood of a return
2207378 there are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is underway
2207379 in the same breath that theyre said to be apolitical theyre said to be a celebration of human rights and theyre said to be a sporting festival we hope that can transcend mere sporting festivals
2207380 i think when we talk about the crisis in darfur we talk about the millions of innocent people that are suffering there and we talk about the positive role that china could play should they choose to and the rest of the international community i mean these people have been failed i think at every level
2207381 chinese authorities have in the past cracked down prior to big international events
2207382 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2207383 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
2207384 feel like you are mindful that the market is still the best way to allocate resources productively that some of the excesses of the 60s and 70s may have hampered economic growth that we dont want to return to marginal tax rates of 60 or 70 percent
2207385 weve become so accustomed to thinking that theres two ways of looking at the economy either you dont give a hoot about whats happening in the daily lives of people so you dont talk about it or conversely you are you know out there raging against the machine
2207386 when you hear me talk about people versus the powerful my populism is built most powerfully around the sense that government is nonresponsive to these folks
2207387 theyre probably less angry at wall street for making money and angrier at washington for not just setting up some basic rules of the road
2207388 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
2207389 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2207390 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2207391 i love combining the idea of trying out new dishes and cuisines with learning a bit more about the country
2207392 food is so caught up with culture and history and personal memories and sometimes i do some research and sometimes i chat to the waiters to find out more
2207393 what im doing isnt about reviewing restaurants but about enjoying a new cultural experience usually with friends
2207394 i bumped into someone who asked me where id been on holiday and i said i hadnt id just been for lunch that was my idea of a holiday and from that i had this random thought that it would be good to eat my way round the world i tend to go for lunch mainly as i find it a real indulgence its really nice to have a leisurely break in good company sometimes with a glass of something and sometimes a soft drink it all feels very civilised
2207395 the emphasis is on enjoyment and developing young players so that they are comfortable with the ball at their feet
2207396 we hope that the courses attract both existing players who wish to develop and learn new skills and new players who simply want to give the sport a try
2207397 our coaches are very well qualified and experienced and they all like to ensure that every player who comes onto a course takes away some new knowledge
2207398 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
2207399 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
2207400 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
2207401 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2207402 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2207403 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2207404 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2207405 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2207406 im really excited about getting these acts to come when felix dexter and howard marx came before they both said they had such a good time that they asked to come back
2207407 i think the way that weve set it up so they can chat with the crowd and people can ask them things helps make it really special and intimate and of course the audience is getting to see some really interesting and entertaining people up close
2207408 i wanted to make it a bit different too with the audience having a nice meal in relaxed comfy surroundings theyll come and be looked after and have a fantastic night hearing all these funny stories about everything from music to poetry to politics and any number of other subjects
2207409 there isnt really anything like this round here and i think the events will be a good night out for anyone who wants something different without having to go to lots of different venues
2207410 i want to congratulate schools and pupils for all their hard work over the last decade there has been sustained improvement at key stage two
2207411 there is still more to be done before our education system is truly world class and while i am pleased that there continues to be steady improvement overall the results at the higher level show more needs to be done to improve personalised learning to ensure that all children fulfil their potential at this crucial stage
2207412 without doubt road and public transport congestion places a significant cost on a region like greater manchester this will escalate substantially over the next decade
2207413 congestion charging is a controversial solution but where it pays for investment in public transport extensive research shows that there are substantial benefits for the local economy
2207414 china is smiling at the world but the world is not smiling back
2207415 political news is not as salient as it used to be
2207416 emcore will be the first to benefit from the ramp of the cpv business
2207417 we continue to sign long term agreements with a wider base of customers and are on schedule for an initial public offering in mid 2009
2207418 emcore will be the first to benefit from the ramp of the cpv business
2207419 we continue to sign long term agreements with a wider base of customers and are on schedule for an initial public offering in mid 2009
2207420 has been marred by a well documented surge in violations of the rights of free expression and association as well as media freedom in addition abuses of migrant construction workers who were pivotal to beijings infrastructure improvements have increased as have evictions of beijing residents whose homes were demolished to make way for that infrastructure
2207421 crackdown on human rights defenders journalists and lawyers has intensified because beijing is hosting the olympics the authorities have stepped up repression of dissident voices in their efforts to present an image of stability and harmony to the outside world
2207422 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2207423 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2207424 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions yet change will arrive
2207425 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition
2207426 northenden labour party has called on vicar greg forster to resign he clearly behaved in a party political way backing a new tax on northenden residents and appearing on lib dem leaflets
2207427 he used his parish magazine for this propaganda in the run up to the recent local government elections his behaviour on this and other instances related to the images of st wilfrids school has been a disgrace and he should go
2207428 i was shocked to see the piece i did indicate that i thought a civil parish council would be a good idea but the issue became a political football
2207429 mike kane seems to blame me for a very tight defeat in the local elections because i supported a parish council however i think that particular issue lost martin eakins as many votes as he gained from it theres a lot of point scoring going on between labour and the lib dems in northenden
2207430 the article was based on the feedback weve received a number of people have complained to me because as a vicar he shouldnt appear party political
2207431 were terribly upset weve helped the parish for 20 years
2207432 he wrote a number of critical things in the run up to the election and was quoted on a lib dem leaflet which went out the day before giving us no time to respond it was no way for a member of the cloth to behave
2207433 we have no idea what we saw but they were not conventional aircraft microlights paramotors helicopters when zoomed in on the flying objects they had no wings and were of circular shape
2207434 i watched the fire from start to finish i love how it united burnage for one night
2207435 funny what you find under the surface of a manchester car park
2207436 has indian classical music ever been so rock and roll
2207437 you are good i will keep a lookout for you when i am next in fallowfield
2207438 i work in that store it was amazing how they planned it
2207439 brilliantly thought provoking anyone who watches this and thinks about you all blocking their way in the supermarket is missing the message we are all frozen in the supermarket lifeless consumerism
2207440 olivia explorer is about exploring childhood imagination and the naive innocence that makes being a child so magical
2207441 im so excited ive never been to china before and thats going to be an experience in itself but to go to the olympics too is going to be incredible
2207442 ive only just been told im going so its all a bit of a whirlwind really and im not really sure what to expect
2207443 when the commonwealth games were held in manchester the atmosphere was great and i bet in beijing its going to be incredible
2207444 weve been stocking tsingtao for a while now and its a really nice bottled beer slightly sweet with a nutty taste so itll be interesting to see where they brew it
2207445 i reckon ill have to learn a few chinese words too before i go
2207446 after we sent our mystery drinkers out we found that ben was the best seller in the uk terms of talking about the beer to customers and serving it well
2207447 it is completely nuts they are already planning another tesco in whalley range they are like an outbreak of smallpox
2207448 as always the decision has been taken completely out of the hands of elected people and the local residents of the manchester community we dont have any appeal process and once this store is there we wont have any say
2207449 we have always argued that it is a completely inappropriate place for a large convenience store the size of the store is going to go up three fold
2207450 it is already a really difficult part of manchester road and with a big tesco express in the middle of it it is just going to be a complete nightmare
2207451 im disappointed but not surprised i knew they would bludgeon their way through everywhere tesco goes it is the end of the community the shops are declining and we are not busy at the moment i think it will have an adverse effect on trade
2207452 i cant see it really helping to keep people within the local chorlton economy
2207453 i just think that this will function as an isolated unit i would have been much happier if the petrol pump part of the plan had been decommissioned
2207454 the fact that the decision could be overturned by people in whitehall in the face of a local decision made by local decision makers in my opinion is wrong
2207455 a new tesco express store will significantly enhance the range and choice of convenience shopping within the area
2207456 i felt as if medical information on the web was more underdeveloped than other areas i was used to spending time on the web with
2207457 ive been building web sites for years and i felt that there needed to be an upgrade on what was available
2207458 in the big picture its an attempt to engage the health and medical communities with web technology something that is only beginning today
2207459 we have a vast repository of content created by faculty and peer reviewed internally
2207460 our goal is to distribute high quality health information to the general public and thats part of harvard medical schools educational mission
2207461 the aim of the site is just to push out information
2207462 its sort of amazing how many insights non health professionals who have personally experienced disease can provide about that disease
2207463 will enough people contribute enough time and energy to make medpedia what it aspires to become
2207464 we will be announcing our numbers when we launch the site
2207465 when they originally told us it was going to be like two houses to an acre now they want r6 zoning which is six houses to an acre
2207466 were not here to stir up any trouble were here to try to provide service to our consumers in the rural area were not interested in taking anything away from anybody
2207467 when they apply for a phone number or a car registration they want eight as the last number
2207468 oh my goodness this is really a very very lucky day
2207469 many disasters have occurred on the eighth or on a date the total of which comes to eight
2207470 the number eight is not a very auspicious number it brings hardship and bad luck
2207471 eights are mystical and mankind is an incurably mystical race
2207472 i would predict were going to see greater superstition in the next 14 18 months

2207480 he is a very direct player with lots of pace and is a natural and proven scorer
2207481 although roy can play wide right and midfield i see him as a striker and im sure hell be a big success in the spl
2207482 im also certain that united supporters will enjoy seeing him play for the team
2207483 roy is a player i know very well having tried to get him from cork before his move to sunderland
2207484 in fact he might have been one of my first signings for dundee united had it not been for interest in the player from the premiership i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2207485 hell benefit greatly from playing regular first team football at the highest level in scotland and therefore this deal is not only good for dundee united but will also be to the advantage of the player and his club
2207486 the 12 year old stayed home during the day he didnt go to school

2207492 the guy might think everythings okay since theyre not arguing much but that can really mean shes over the relationship and planning her exit strategy

2207497 esperamos que este d a de la suerte tambi n traiga fortuna a la ceremonia inaugural es un d a muy especial para nosotros en china aproximadamente 10 000 personas deciden casarse hoy
2207498 he cannot possibly demonstrate prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice
2207499 it takes you back to a very ugly time in history in texas when we killed people because of the color of their skin and their poverty
2207500 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things
2207501 we often leave our healthy diets behind which stresses our digestion
2207502 dans une p riode qui sera la plus courte possible
2207503 le haut conseil detat a mis fin aux pouvoirs du pr sident de la r publique investi le 19 avril 2007 et prendra les dispositions qui simposent en vue de garantir la continuit de letat

2207506 nous condamnons de la fa on la plus vigoureuse le renversement par larm e du gouvernement lu d mocratiquement en mauritanie et lheure actuelle toute aide ext rieure non humanitaire est suspendue et en cours dexamen

2207511 thats probably the longest ive ever heard of one but you cant put out spike strips on the river and put out their tires like you can on the highway system
2207512 you cant radio ahead for assistance it just doesnt exist youre kind of at the mercy of them until they stop or do something stupid
2207513 it appeared that he either passed out or slumped out from behind the steering wheel
2207514 well i dont have to write this kind of story now because walt has already done it well enough and i can just tell people to read it if they would like a peek into what is sometimes happening in my own often chaotic mind
2207515 had enough of him and dump him from the line up
2207516 it is as stupid as is fuelwatch the proposed petrol price register
2207517 telling australians what the price of baked beans was a month ago and putting it on the internet is not going to do anything to bring the price of groceries down
2207518 and mr rudd needs to focus on the real issues that are worrying australians every day
2207519 the healthier system would allow more flows through the darling and into nsw there is water available in the darling basin and its for sale
2207520 buying these properties would be a win win win for the environment for the communities in the basin and for willing sellers
2207521 customs and its law enforcement partners are working hard to stop shipments like these from reaching australian streets
2207522 investigations like this one that include targeting the illegal financing of organised criminal syndicates involved in the global trade in illicit drugs are proving highly successful and ensure an economic as well as social return for the community
2207523 i would argue there is a need for higher superannuation contributions
2207524 as a general comment i would agree that low middle earners would need a higher level of superannuation contribution above the 9 per cent
2207525 in terms of equity it is unfair that lower income earners are effectively taxed on a higher rate on their super contributions than their marginal income
2207526 but one of our election commitments was we will not be increasing the 9 per cent super guarantee which is payable by the employer we have ruled it out and we will be sticking to that
2207527 my fund has lost money inflation eats into it bla bla
2207528 raised money for an organisation which does not worry about doing killing in pursuit of its political objectives
2207529 it finally vindicates mr ali and restores his reputation as well as his confidence in the australian community
2207530 mr ali worked tirelessly to ease tensions between muslim and non muslim members of his local community after the bali bombing in 2002 work which was destroyed by the untrue articles
2207531 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2207532 there are probably some workplaces where the f word is commonly used but it has no place in negotiations between employers and employees about wages and conditions
2207533 and as for you jennifer asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2207534 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire everyone people who do care about my business
2207535 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2207536 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2207537 theyve extrapolated their own view that the f word is banned thats not the case
2207538 you would think in a nice pristine environment no one would be swearing but the fact of life is it does happen
2207539 it would be nice to have a lovely atmosphere but sometimes that breaks down lets not have more political correctness heaped on to stuff weve already got
2207540 i have uncles who are very similar to this guy lovable losers who feel that life has passed them by i wanted it to be comedically fresh but at the same time to feel like a real journey even though i was sweaty the whole time and covered in vaseline
2207541 there are nerd fans who view him as their god but dwight is also loved by a certain component of frat boy guys who wear flip flops and puka shells and rock out to john mayer hes been adopted as a misfit stepbrother to those guys
2207542 i think that from will ferrell to jack black to judd apatow off beat character men have taken over comedy
2207543 a movie about a mexican wrestler jack blacks 2006 film nacho libre can make 80 million the days when you had to be eddie murphy or jim carrey mega comedians to open a movie are over its exciting
2207544 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2207545 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2207546 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2207547 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2207548 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
2207549 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2207550 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2207551 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2207552 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2207553 the collapse of the doha round for the liberalisation of trade in favour of development is a major blow to the possibility of a more inclusive world
2207554 if we cannot achieve doha which is literally the low hanging fruit how are we going to solve climate change infinitely more complex
2207555 how are we going to handle migration or the challenge of extreme poverty affecting hundreds of millions maybe billions on the planet
2207556 its not going to be possible people are feeling a little tight budgets are under pressure and now some politicians are saying that all charity starts at home
2207557 if we are able to send joint messages on relevant policy issues it will be very difficult for the leaders to ignore us they shall do so at their peril
2207558 we found very important areas of cooperation going on the rich experience that both the oecd and australia have had over the years
2207559 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
2207560 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2207561 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2207562 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2207563 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2207564 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2207565 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2207566 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2207567 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2207568 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2207569 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2207570 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2207571 to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under the heaven
2207572 there have always been musicians in our family but my father was the first to support himself that way
2207573 the agency recognizes that a number of factors contribute to high corn prices as a nation and as a nation we must address these challenges the rfs mandate however will remain an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen our dependence on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
2207574 but its done wonders for the garden it gets better all the time
2207575 someone else may have put in a pink lotus pool
2207576 i just buy something and walk around and look for a place to stick it
2207577 and if it doesnt do i put something else in i like anything that takes care of itself and just grows i dont like to have to coddle them and beg them and watch them and compliment them and urge them to grow
2207578 such exuberance such flinging itself about joyously the fire seemed to be fairly swooning with pleasure after years of growing sagebrush scrub by earth and water now air and fire were having a turn at it the eternal foursome joining in a dance
2207579 i dont believe that there is a person thats ever been through this process that respects it more than i do
2207580 now that hes caught hes taking responsibility he thought he got away with it
2207581 i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2207582 it was a sorry thing to see innocent people killed i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the u s i personally present my apologies to them if anything i did has caused them pain
2207583 but we dont kill all murderers we dont execute all murderers we do it according to the law
2207584 when your state violates international law to kill somebody it has very negative consequences
2207585 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2207586 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2207587 typically when you have strong activity during july thats also a very strong indicator the remainder of the season will be above normal
2207588 este d a se ha ido un hombre bueno bueno subrayado el bueno
2207589 a nombre del gobierno las condolencias y el sentimiento de p rdida por la muerte de juan bustos
2207590 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2207591 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2207592 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2207593 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2207594 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2207595 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2207596 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul
2207597 i finally told him about a month before the election
2207598 its the difference between wearing jammies to bed and wearing your work clothes to bed
2207599 unbifurcated garments are far more comfortable and suitable to male anatomy than trousers or shorts because they dont confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do
2207600 please open your hearts and inseams for an option in mail carrier comfort
2207601 i got so pumped up after being at such a low that im taking this to the next convention in 2010 in anaheim calif
2207602 due to the increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research in recent months our first concern is for our employees and the animals we care for at charles river
2207603 usda did open an inquiry when we filed a complaint
2207604 their statement about fears for their own safety is absurd
2207605 they have an abysmal record of animal care as usual they are more interested in their reputation than in the animals safety
2207606 that monkeys were literally cooked to death by a heating system failure as a whistleblower alleges shows that the facility did not even have a simple alarm system in place to alert staff to the malfunction
2207607 hay una campa a de provocaci n promovida por sectores conservadores en contra del referendo y la democracia los gobernantes no caer n en esa provocaci n no le dar n pretextos a estos grupos de choque furiosos que quieren generar enfrentamiento en la sociedad boliviana y para garantizar la tranquilidad de la ciudadan a y estabilizar los nimos son estas decisiones
2207608 lamentar los enfrentamientos lamentar las muertes de dos ciudadanos bolivianos pero tambi n lamentar la degeneraci n pol tica de una cob no de sus bases luchadoras honestas humildes y trabajadoras sino de una direcci n decadente que se convirti en el ariete en el grupo de choque de una derecha cavernaria y antidemocr tica
2207609 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2207610 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2207611 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2207612 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2207613 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2207614 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2207615 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2207616 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2207617 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2207618 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2207619 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2207620 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2207621 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2207622 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2207623 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2207624 this goes to show the people of japan and the government of japan that they can be reassured that the united states navy will be forthright in disclosing details about any inadvertent release of radioactivity even when it is extremely small
2207625 i explained how the so called enemy the viet cong and the north vietnamese were actually the legitimate parties and how the u s presence was illegal immoral and unwise i supplied him with reams of documentation
2207626 this was an extraordinary thing for someone who had until recently held a top secret clearance to say to anyone least of all to someone who still had a clearance
2207627 i asked him if he knew where we could find a xerox machine
2207628 and within an hour he got back to me with the word that his then girlfriend had a machine in her office we could use
2207629 a real patriot of this country someone who fought for right and justice
2207630 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2207631 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2207632 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
2207633 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
2207634 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2207635 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
2207636 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2207637 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2207638 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2207639 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2207640 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2207641 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2207642 he knew how to bring together orchestra and singing doing everything possible to bring out the best singing performance
2207643 it is not by chance that he worked with callas when she had her small vocal problems
2207644 bueno esto se interrumpe porque ha fallecido nuestro presidente y compa ero juan bustos y comunicarles que se han decretado tres d as de duelo nacional en su homenaje y yo pedir a un aplauso para juan bustos

2207722 we have never practiced like this we are doing a great job of helping each other get better i saw a great job up front today several times the defense got to the quarterback but then let up and allowed him to throw those types of things are going to help us get better as a team
2207723 we have had an outstanding first four practices the coaching staff could not be more pleased with the attitude and the mental approach we have received from the team
2207724 we thought they might take a step back when we went from helmets to shells yesterday but again we were very proud of how they responded the mental alertness and sharpness didnt drop off at all
2207725 we have some very athletic guys that come up to the line and are very tough to handle sometimes
2207726 theyre a little bit quicker than the average defensive lineman and that enables them to get free the defense is off to a great start in terms of installing their complete package and putting pressure on the quarterback
2207727 this early in camp those long plays are even a plus to the defense they get to go back and see it on tape tonight learn from it and improve before the next practice
2207728 we cant get too excited about the things we do well everyone still has several things that can be worked on and improved in order to become a great player by game one were going to look at tape tonight get better as individuals and have an even better practice as a team tomorrow
2207729 get this taken care of or go around on one leg forever
2207730 so take a new grip with your tired hands and stand firm on your shaky legs

2207733 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy
2207734 my grandmother always warned us to stay away from it because it could break our legs i wasnt sure how but i wasnt taking chances
2207735 after many years of living with a wet basement i dont keep anything on the floor or within two feet of the floor that cant get wet
2207736 sump pumps wear out dry out overheat lose lubrication or blow a circuit if put on the same one as another major appliance
2207737 how nice is your basement what is six inches of water going to do to you
2207738 this is a great way to be a part of nature rather than fight against it
2207739 as we learn about wildlife we learn to appreciate what a huge impact we humans are having on the rest of the creatures on this planet we are the only hope they have
2207740 it tolerates anything sun shade wet dry its ornamental peeling bark is very attractive in the winter
2207741 and im really starting to push sumac its tough and drought tolerant a plant more people should use its also salt tolerant and takes occasional flooding
2207742 food is best provided by using native plants for their berries seeds nuts nectar pollen and foliage
2207743 natives rather than exotics are preferable because they and their native wildlife have co existed and evolved together to be part of a mutually sustainable environment
2207744 people were afraid of so many things even witches were protected here
2207745 he was telling everybody he was sorry for our troubles and blaming events beyond his control the nations real estate

2207748 generally parents are willing to give the children a good deal
2207749 kids are thrilled because they have the opportunity to own something they otherwise wouldnt
2207750 we kept thinking that as long as we paid him the rent we would be all right
2207751 this last landlord he didnt even seem like the type who would do that to somebody but what is the type
2207752 early on the focus was all on the homeowners problems
2207753 its only now that the renters dilemma is bubbling up to the top
2207754 we should start thinking of ourselves as brands and control our message
2207755 thats what were doing when we put ourselves out there people dont have a sense of their identity as something they have property rights to

2207772 its not a real privacy risk in this context since your ip changes pretty regularly
2207773 its not unusual that perpetrators or suspects try to hide stuff in the cruisers before they go to booking where they know theyll be searched
2207774 devis e regulations that can provide for rational management of gun ownership
2207775 people should be made to wait ten days before buying a gun
2207776 reporters and editors should cool off ten days before writing
2207777 we must ban guns that fire more than one shot in rapid succession
2207778 we must ban printing presses that print more than one page in rapid succession and those web servers millions of hits per hour dangerous
2207779 oh but thats different guns can bring down a government
2207780 im so glad you called me for this jury ive been trying to get some kind of control in my life forever
2207781 i just dont think this packer team and gm ted thompson especially is thinking in terms of winning with me
2207782 on the other hand 1996 packers gm ron wolf is committed to building the team completely around me i dont think its out of the question to say that with me behind center the 1996 packers are looking at going all the way to the super bowl
2207783 nothing against donald driver and greg jennings but if i cant throw it to randy moss then i want to throw it to antonio freeman robert brooks and don beebe
2207784 i bet with them id have more of a chance of throwing for say 3 899 yards and 39 touchdowns with maybe as few as 13 interceptions who knows that kind of production could even get me another mvp award although of course thats much less important than leading the 96 pack to another super bowl victory
2207785 it sure would be great to play alongside reggie white again i get chills just thinking about seeing him in the locker room
2207786 that whole 96 defense is great too santana dotson is a force in the middle that leroy butler i tell you hes one of the most underrated safeties in the game desmond howard isnt a bad kick returner either and unlike the packer backfield i got now the 96 packers still feature william henderson at fullback
2207787 decent tight end but something about him isnt quite right
2207788 i think holmgren and i would make an interesting team
2207789 he could teach me a lot we could learn from each other and i know ron wolf would have my back if say our number one receiver gets knocked out for the season in week 7 i believe wolf would go right after a great veteran free agent like maybe andre rison to give us an edge in the playoffs i can almost guarantee that
2207790 wed be one of the all time great teams a once in a lifetime thing you know im going to have my agent look into it right away
2207791 in our investigation we believe an ak 47 was brought on school grounds
2207792 foi o melhor do ano melhor de todos daquele tipo de livro que tenho sempre a m o para uma releitura e posso indicar com toda confian a como sendo um livro completo
2207793 i usually have some clout when it comes to the remote
2207794 i think to a lot of people it means a lot of different things but for me im just iliza and i won im a comedian that won the female thing i cant comment on because i just dont feel that in my heart
2207795 no one ever voted for me they always just challenged me
2207796 if you really look at it the majority of people didnt try to get me out of the house it was those who were voted for that thought id be the weakest
2207797 i was always very vulnerable because i kind of just knew that it would always be me not so much getting voted off but always being challenged
2207798 so i was always ready for it i never for a second thought i was untouchable or invincible until last night just after the show ended
2207799 i would say through others doubt is where i grew stronger had those people not looked at me as a girl who had no material or as a threat or a nothing i got to showcase my stand up for the world when no one else was doing it
2207800 i think the audience got a vested interest in me as the underdog early on i think that was the key in me winning
2207801 i knew that i had to prove myself to myself and to the audience
2207802 at the end of the day the audience was my main concern i dont really care what the other comics think of me
2207803 it was fine everybody was really respectful we never were at each others throats i dont know if professional is the right word but it was fine it wasnt like i was in a frat house we were all there with a common goal
2207804 i came in with a goal and regardless of who was in the house i would have done my best to achieve that goal
2207805 these shows are the reason america is becoming not such a good place as far as pop culture goes this is the reason people dont like us is because of shows like this but i cant stop watching them
2207806 i will watch anything thats a reality show that has bad editing and a bad storyline to be honest with you
2207807 if i watch someone on stage i get anxious i want to be on stage so i never watched last comic because it would make me anxious to watch other comics just as a comedian thats how i feel
2207808 so i never got around to watching the show before because im either on that show or not a part of it of course ill watch it from now on because i got it out of my system
2207809 i really want to be financially responsible i know this sounds boring but im going to pay off my one student loan that i have which is a small one im going to get an operation for my cat so his ear stops dripping wax i know thats gross
2207810 i think im just going to put the rest of it aside for when i actually find something that i need because im a pretty simple person
2207811 instead of alleging concrete injury plaintiffs assert a generalized grievance with a particular government policy

2207859 due to a reoccurring medical condition klaus flouride has decided that the rigors of touring and the demands of the band were the determining factors in making this difficult decision
2207860 flouride will continue to perform regionally with bands like the american professionals the go going gone girls band and the legendary stardust cowboy but the road has become a grind that is counterproductive to his health
2207861 over the past 30 years i have had the great fortune to have been a founding member of dead kennedys its been tough at times but particularly rewarding
2207862 however a recurring medical condition called angioedema has caused me to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the road as a touring member of dead kennedys

2207882 ill be an italian youll be calling me kobe giovani you know what i mean
2207883 im going to negotiate a contract with another team somewhere i aint going back
2207884 in 04 we didnt know anything we were blind it was embarrassing to come back to the states knowing were supposed to be the best basketball players in the world and to come back with a third place medal
2207885 we really took a big hit not just as a team but as a country
2207886 a lot of people are saying it will be the most viewed sporting event ever in china
2207887 playing china in the very first game i dont know if it gets better than that
2207888 after we lost in 04 everyone has pride and took that to the heart
2207889 we want to show that our game is still the best were the founders of this game
2207890 we feel that family chemistry other countries have over the last few years
2207891 when a firefighter dies everyone knows him because we are all from the same cut
2207892 it affected everybody emotionally but everybody accepted the challenge and went back to what we do everyday
2207893 they are experiencing great grief about the missing and those who are injured
2207894 if were going to fight obesity we need to teach folks about nutrition and proper eating
2207895 i question whether this ordinance will have a real meaningful impact on peoples behavior in terms of what they eat and how much they exercise
2207896 we recognize our customers do want this information but most of the customers dont want this information forced on them every time its as much as a mandate on our customers as it is on our restaurants
2207897 you could fit all four of the teeth onto the end of a pencil the blunt end of a pencil
2207898 anthrasimias may also be the oldest anthropoid in the world
2207899 i think that the fossils provide a few tantalizing clues that are consistent with an early presence of primitive anthropoid primates in asia
2207900 but i think that to have real confidence in the conclusions we need more material from the skeleton of this animal anthrasimias so from its cranium limbs and hands and feet
2207901 what we can say from the teeth is that these animals were also probably largely or significantly insectivorous
2207902 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2207903 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
2207904 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
2207905 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2207906 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts
2207907 ive heard people speak of it as a level of humility about understanding different cultures thats quite appropriate
2207908 science is a wonderful thing but it is at the end of the day a tool
2207909 there was always the lingering question as to whether you would ever really be able to find differences that would be useful in terms of doing attribution
2207910 finding that you could really apply many of the same parallels with human forensics to microbial forensics
2207911 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2207912 if they were engineered by dr ivins its highly unlikely that they would pop up anywhere else
2207913 their case hinges on the fact that these strains came out of this particular flask
2207914 confessed to having had access to a banned drug and he explained the context in which he received the substance
2207915 i have got a weight off my shoulders im conscious of what i did and as a result i decided to cooperate
2207916 we would encourage all drivers male and female to think about the consequences of driving after having a drink
2207917 even one drink can impair judgement and affect our ability to drive if you are planning on driving the safest option really is to have nothing at all to drink
2207918 people think it wont happen to them that they wont get caught they wont be involved in a crash we must challenge these presumptions in order to change drivers attitudes and behaviour
2207919 the thought of getting caught and the consequences need to seem a very real prospect for drivers who through selfishness or ignorance continue to put lives at risk by getting behind the wheel after drinking
2207920 for drivers who do want to abide by the law we must make it easy for them to do so by sending out a very clear message that even one drink is one too many
2207921 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2207922 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2207923 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2207924 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2207925 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2207926 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2207927 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2207928 however here we are in mexico city still in the middle of a raging pandemic
2207929 to be sure there are multiple and daunting challenges ahead in terms of how we confront hiv globally not all but certainly some of these challenges can only be addressed through biomedical research
2207930 even with the drugs we have today or with forms of the drugs that are very similar to what we have today if we could develop forms of these drugs that could be taken for life with acceptable levels of toxicity than its in principle possible to offer everyone who is currently living with hiv infection the chance for a normal life this is the long term challenge that all of us face
2207931 prevention care and treatment for children continue to lag behind adults
2207932 support for affected children has been left largely to families extended kin and communities although they are the most appropriate group to care for children they cannot protect and care for children without assistance
2207933 when there is a country that discriminates that is conservative that criminalizes sex work the prevalence of hiv is higher
2207934 if the policy is bad today what will it mean for the next 20 years 50 years so that we start building campaigns building towards 2031 because by 2031 if we havent done anything it might be too late
2207935 will likely require aggressive drug regimens and rely on the timing of initiating therapy
2207936 studies need to be done in the next few years to determine if very aggressive therapy early on will allow us to get a functional cure
2207937 we have to make sure the drug development remains in step with the evolution of the virus and that industry continues to invest
2207938 worrying signs that that isnt the case and that is something we have to put on the table
2207939 no company will try to sell soap if they havent done research for the community they are trying to sell to
2207940 it would pay off if we could bring that experience from the business world to our amateur approaches
2207941 continue with efforts aimed at reversing this level of maternal mortality
2207942 it just said up there rage played the dnc in 00 and it ended in tear gas and pepper spray theyre not called rage against the republicans their gripe is with the whole damn system truthfully if they had a bias against republicans where the hell have they been for the last 8 years
2207943 im pretty excited about it because i get to make up my own world there
2207944 i love the idea and i love the characters but i dont know if i can do it
2207945 it just has the soul of the book it had bella and edwards relationship
2207946 it wouldnt feel like this movie was based on something i did without muse in it
2207947 it seems that we have got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2207948 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2207949 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2207950 charming thoughtful and incisive melding the very best components of the first three albums while managing to as ever sound refreshingly new
2207951 short stories we love em and dzanc books a small press out of michigan that shot out of the gate with keseys all over is going to be publishing a lot of them this is a book that combines the wiliness of george saunders and the wisdom of ron carlson put simply this is a great collection
2207952 what the world will look like when all the water leaves us

2207960 some people in particular those who aspire to olympic success may think that anabolic steroids can enhance their performance but they can in fact have serious health consequences
2207961 with the london 2012 games coming ever closer we must ensure that drug cheats and those supplying and trafficking banned substances have no place to hide
2207962 we take security and privacy very seriously which is why the british biometric passport meets international standards as set out by international civil aviation organisation icao and we remain confident that it is one of the most secure passports available
2207963 it is of deep concern the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
2207964 what is worse the same technology will underpin the governments identity card scheme which risks making us less safe
2207965 by putting your private information on a chip on a passport or id card designed to let it be skimmed off for official purposes the whole centralised approach to id makes it easier for your life to be perfectly stolen
2207966 the government cannot be trusted to look after your identity
2207967 measures it calls secure are only securing official convenience with an id card or chipped passport youll never know whos walking around pretending to be you
2207968 the e passports fiasco clearly illustrates why the national identity scheme must be scrapped now before millions more peoples personal security is put at risk
2207969 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
2207970 because right now we have probably 150 children that depend on us their lives are with the school their families have finally found a school where their children can do academically very well and socially very well its their home
2207971 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008

2207982 he was an outstanding executive and a passionate supporter of the company steve commanded the fullest respect and affection of everyone in our industry we are deeply saddened by his death and our sympathies are with his family
2207983 if he has any problem differences with someone he should keep it within the party
2207984 he should not rush to the media to air his grievances the party has a mechanism to deal with such things
2207985 no one should talk about what happens inside the cabinet
2207986 it will be a mistake to take party discipline lightly
2207987 yes there have been offers but it is too early to comment on anything
2207988 there have been offers and this was among the many offers she has received it is too early to comment because she is busy with her bollywood commitments
2207989 such decision should have been taken much earlier he said that the country was passing through a critical stage of his history and it was all due to wrong policies of musharraf he said that all national institutions and assets were at stake due to growing external and regional pressure
2207990 all parliamentarians will have to vote against musharraf for the supremacy of the parliament

2208006 whether vohra is recalled or not is of no concern to me
2208007 the realization that my own unhappiness cannot be dealt with until i stop blaming other people or circumstances and start taking responsibility and making the decisions i needed to make was a difficult one and one i am still working on
2208008 i think we can both hold each other up in prayer and conversation and accountability in this i have struggled with a feeling of helplessness and unhappiness for nearly a decade and it is a breath of fresh are to even start the climb out of that pit it is a tough climb we can help each other
2208009 i think ill adjust the temperature overlay to high transparency because that makes the red pink and i like pink
2208010 edwards said his wife elizabeth and others in his family became aware of the affair in 2006
2208011 i am deeply concerned over the slow growth in business of bsnl in spite of regular review meetings with the officials of bsnl it is a serious matter and it has to be monitored and reviewed by the secretary telecom on regular basis

2208021 i wouldnt say its an easy job it can only get worse i suppose
2208022 ive been getting a few text messages asking who writes my scripts but i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can and im just playing the game that i love
2208023 ive been getting to know more about the players and how they operate and thats come on in leaps and bounds in the three or four days ive been in charge
2208024 its given me a really different perspective and now when they are batting i really want them to do well for me and for the team its more of a holistic type of thing which is great
2208025 more than me getting a hundred i really wanted steve to get a fifty today and an even bigger score
2208026 hes deserved it after being away from the game for six months to see him back and smiling and laughing the cynical little man that he is its great its lovely to see him back
2208027 another day of doing the simple things as best i can and doing them right
2208028 you just have to go and bat and make sure you try and score as many as you can all the nonsense that happened before the game the scrutiny and the attention youve got to get on with it but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday and knew the cricket was on the way
2208029 you have to do the press conferences and live the life but the cricket is what i love
2208030 before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work that i normally do i just have to give that extra time and responsibility to the other players to build their confidence and speak to them which i dont mind it just keeps me involved a little longer at training
2208031 if i am having a good day today or yesterday was a good day then it was a good day
2208032 ive had lots of bad days but ive had a lot more good days than bad days so far in my career so ill just keep doing what i normally do but its probably no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better

2208063 ich denke dass das ein wichtiger punkt ist ich bin der meinung dass internationale erfahrung enorm wichtig ist die gewinnst du nur wenn du regelm ig dienstags mittwochs oder donnerstags am spielbetrieb teilnimmst ich spiele mit dem bvb im uefa cup ich freue mich auf diese herausforderung
2208064 n ich habe aber viele anrufe und gl ckw nsche bekommen
2208065 zum jetzigen zeitpunkt eigentlich schon damit hatte ich nicht gerechnet ich war schlie lich ein halbes jahr verletzt trotzdem habe ich mich sehr gefreut dass der bundestrainer mich nicht vergessen hat da ich bis zu meiner verletzung ber jahre in der bundesliga konstant gute leistungen gebracht habe ich habe mich sehr ber diese aussage des bundestrainers gefreut
2208066 der bundestrainer hat immer deutlich gemacht dass ausschlie lich leistungskriterien bei der auswahl eine rolle spielen deswegen bestand f r mich kein anlass mich ffentlich ins gespr ch zu bringen ich vertraue voll und ganz joachim l w und werde alles tun um ihn durch meine leistungen auf dem platz davon zu berzeugen dass ich ihm bei der besetzung der torwart position helfen kann
2208067 ich denke dass das ein wichtiger punkt ist ich bin der meinung dass internationale erfahrung enorm wichtig ist die gewinnst du nur wenn du regelm ig dienstags mittwochs oder donnerstags am spielbetrieb teilnimmst ich spiele mit dem bvb im uefa cup ich freue mich auf diese herausforderung
2208068 das ist toll darauf habe ich die ganze zeit hingearbeitet es ist f r die mannschaft und f r mich wie ein neuanfang wir wollen wieder auf ganz hohem niveau fu ball spielen
2208069 die reha war eine schwierige zeit sie war oft eint nig und langweilig ich konnte mich nicht wie gewohnt bewegen konnte nur zuschauen nie eingreifen ich habe das gef hl vermisst gebraucht zu werden ich denke dass dich jede verletzung ver ndert reifer macht ich habe meinen k rper noch besser kennengelernt sehe sachen aus einem anderen blickwinkel will auch st rken aus dieser zeit ziehen ich bin ruhiger und gelassener geworden
2208070 diese situationen sind meiner meinung nicht ganz vergleichbar ich habe das damals sehr wohl zur kenntnis genommen so ist das im fu ball aber ich schaue jetzt nur nach vorne
2208071 das war der negative h hepunkt der ganzen zeit ich hatte mich gefreut darauf hingearbeitet und dann wird dir von heute auf morgen diese chance genommen da ist erst mal drei tage nichts gelaufen ich war nur niedergeschlagen aber auch das ist fu ball es macht dich reifer und st rker
2208072 das ist richtig ich war in einer praxis f r ganzk rper training um meinen k rper noch geschmeidiger und gelenkiger zu machen jeder berufsfu baller sollte in seinen k rper investieren ich will ja noch zehn jahre auf hohem niveau spielen durch die vorbereitung bin ich beschwerdefrei gekommen ich bin topfit habe keinerlei probleme au er ab und zu mal muskelkater nach den trainingseinheiten lacht rot weiss essen kann kommen
2208073 das war ein riesenvertrauensvorschuss und einfach klasse ich werde dieses vertrauen zur ckzahlen
2208074 ich war ein halbes jahr verletzt und es ist noch ber ein jahr zeit ich bin da entspannt und lasse das auf mich zukommen ich bin schlie lich im besten fu baller alter und ich wei was ich kann
2208075 das ausland ist f r jeden profi reizvoll aber da muss auch alles passen ich bin aber nach dortmund gekommen um titel zu holen das hat bisher noch nicht geklappt obwohl der supercup eine nette abwechslung war der bvb ist eine top adresse in deutschland und in europa wir k nnen an einem guten tag jede mannschaft schlagen
2208076 wir hatten in den vergangenen spielzeiten pech mit verletzungen aber wenn alle mann an bord bleiben und wir uns in der saison kontinuierlich verbessern sind wir auch f r eine berraschung gut

2208089 magazines have to be sensitive to perceptions that light skinned african americans are more acceptable
2208090 i have to say a couple of things that i feel are important to say right now
2208091 a few months ago i did a quick interview with entertainment tonight and i stuck my foot in my mouth and said that i was having twins by accident
2208092 i begged them to edit that out and not say anything yet as i wasnt ready for it to be out there then but that when i was i would give it to them exclusively
2208093 they really could have ran with it but they said they would not
2208094 they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
2208095 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in
2208096 in the past couple of years high profile type people seem to have less and less rights less privacy and protection
2208097 it is so nice that et does not engage in that and that they still respect people entertainers and artists that they see and respect their value in society and still give them some dignity and respect

2208101 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
2208102 of course this is by no means an election endorsement who they choose as their president is the americans business
2208103 those who operate on the premise of short time periods in iraq today are being more realistic artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
2208104 would like to see the establishment of a long term strategic treaty with the united states which would govern the basic aspects of our economic and cultural relations
2208105 see what the situation on the ground is and thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
2208106 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2208107 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
2208108 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
2208109 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2208110 we are not alone and we know what we need to say from our websites and laptops the street corners and coffeehouses the delis and diners the factory floors and the bookstores on campus at the mall the synagogue sanctuary and mosque lets tell it where we can when we can and while we still can
2208111 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
2208112 the more spin there is the truth gets that much harder to find in the end its all just noise
2208113 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2208114 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm

2208119 he mccain says that he is willing to send our troops into another 100 years of war in iraq

2208129 this summer do something teens rallied to bring tens of thousands of dollars worth of office supplies to staples store collection points
2208130 todays event is a reminder that the weeks leading up to back to school is a great time to join do something 101 and help supply students in need
2208131 the teens who assembled 5 000 kits today for los angeles students are role models for their peers and exemplify what it means to give back to their communities
2208132 we hope teens will continue to donate throughout the month as we know having the right supplies makes for a successful school year
2208133 ich freue mich dass so viele bei dieser hitze zu meiner sommerwanderung gekommen sind viel spa auf dem acht kilometer langen premiumwanderweg durch das sch nste deutsche bundesland
2208134 ich k nnte mir schon vorstellen dass die linke und die spd zusammen mehr stimmen bekommen als die cdu
2208135 aber lafontaine als ministerpr sident das kann ich mir nun wirklich nicht vorstellen
2208136 oskar lafontaine ist doch eine pers nlichkeit die immer nur oben stehen m chte um macht zu haben
2208137 ich bin mir sicher dass die cdu die absolute mehrheit verlieren wird aber ich denke dass sie mit der fdp koalieren wird und peter m ller ministerpr sident bleibt
2208138 egal wer von den beiden gew hlt wird es wird nicht besser im saarland
2208139 die meisten von denen haben dort das gef hl etwas bewegen zu k nnen das fehlt ihnen wohl bei den anderen parteien
2208140 wartet erst mal ab was da n chstes jahr kommen wird
2208141 berall wo bergbau und industrie ist traue ich dem lafontaine schon viel zu
2208142 der guckt den kleinen leuten eben aufs maul und damals als er ministerpr sident war ging es der schwerindustrie auch noch gut
2208143 ich wei noch gar nicht welche partei ich w hlen soll eigentlich finde ich sowohl lafontaine als auch m ller nicht so toll
2208144 we dont want one and we are not seeking one we dont have to offload players simply because of that situation
2208145 there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2208146 we dont have to sell the player or any player at this stage
2208147 some players were going to leave anyway and that will still happen but its not entirely because of our failure to qualify for the champions league
2208148 we had some money there anyway but we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in thats been a difficult task over the close season
2208149 but there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2208150 nobody likes to be criticised in any way shape or form
2208151 but you dont become a football manager expecting to go through your career without receiving a level of criticism
2208152 it comes with the territory when you lose out in the manner we did you expect criticism and its deserved
2208153 from the chairman all the way down we feel the disappointment
2208154 the one thing we have to make sure of is that the disappointment doesnt allow our domestic results to be affected
2208155 there is that little bit extra pressure on us to do well in the league and our thoughts must be on that we cant let ourselves be affected too greatly going into our first league game
2208156 like every other club when you dont have european football thats whats left for you to aim for and everybody aims to do as well as they possibly can
2208157 we would hope to do well in the league we certainly made up the gap that was there between ourselves and celtic last season and they were good enough to go on and clinch the championship at the end when we fell just short
2208158 we have to make the spl our aim for the season and the retention of the two cups we won last year would be something wed look for as well

2208294 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten and former white house counsel harriet e miers yesterday asked a federal judge to delay an order to cooperate with congress while they appeal the ruling
2208295 the court filings indicate that bolten and miers will continue to resist subpoenas from the house judiciary committee as the bush administration heads into its final months
2208296 lawmakers are seeking testimony from miers and documents from bolten related to the firings of nine u s attorneys in 2006 after u s district judge john d batess ruling democrats announced they would schedule hearings on the issue in september less than two months before the presidential elections

2208298 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2208299 w e believe that entertaining any requests for mr boltens compliance with the senate judiciary committee subpoena should await a final resolution by the courts in regard to my august 1 2007 letter to mr rove please be advised that consistent with the above the view stated therein remains the position of the administration on the question of immunity for close presidential advisors
2208300 for more than a year karl rove and the presidents chief of staff have hidden behind baseless and unprecedented claims of absolute immunity not to appear in compliance with subpoenas they continue to withhold critical evidence and testimony and to act as if they are above the law because they work at the white house this claim was rejected by judge bates after months of consideration still the white house refuses to appear or cooperate this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law

2208320 creativity comes from a certain kind of hard work i call deliberate practice this means focusing on what youre doing constant reflection and striving for improvement in contrast to repeating the same action over and over again the flip side is that if you only work hard you wont have any great ideas creative people take time off this allows the unexpected to emerge from your subconscious creativity is what happens when your mind combines new ideas and concepts that you have already mastered these new combinations are not going to pop into your mind while youre working hard theyre going to happen when youre taking a break
2208321 individuals can be highly creative in one sphere but this can have no particular implications for others over and above an intellectual strength in an area compare einstein to picasso or gandhi to woolf the most important traits are personality and temperament are you willing and eager to take chances when you fall flat on your face do you quit or do you ask what have i learned from this defeat in my definition you cannot be truly creative unless you have mastered a domain
2208322 chakras are intellectual and emotional centres portals into the subconscious we believe an enormous amount of creativity lies in the subconscious body not in the conscious mind the subconscious is where all the archetypes and the symbols are by doing qigong and guided imagery people find things that they have repressed things just waiting to come out and blossom people discover a deep inner wealth art is the language of the subconscious
2208323 when you work with reiki you connect with universal flow its a training that will enhance whatever you put your focus on as a creative individual the first thing is to become aware of what draws your attention second catch yourself in the moment focus on your intention what do you want to do maybe you have a spark of insight you connect with the idea and the third thing you do is let go and yield to it you dont become attached to it and become a perfectionist the fourth step is to manifest something greater surrendering and letting go will help enhance your creativity

2208360 im finding that people like that vaudeville element they like being part of a discussion and bring up genuine things that should be discussed
2208361 what i should emphasize is the taboo element the actors are playing characters that do not have down syndrome for whatever reason this can make people feel uncomfortable
2208362 there are reasons why certain things are taboo things that make me uncomfortable that seem perfectly normal in other cultures taboos have a time and a geographical barrier a lot of it is subjective

2208379 and the man that committeth adultery with another mans wife even he that committeth adultery with his neighbours wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death
2208380 a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them
2208381 and the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy god or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put away the evil from israel
2208382 if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear
2208383 but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shalt thou put evil away from among you

2208756 the era of the united states as the dominant influence in latin america is over
2208757 inappropriate and irrelevant to the changed realities and trends of the future
2208758 wise for the united states to make an explicit move to abandon the monroe doctrine
2208759 abandoning the strategic perspective which has shaped u s policy from the monroe doctrine down to the eve of the carter administration at the center of which was a conception of the national interest and a belief in the moral legitimacy of its defense

2208774 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2208775 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2208776 countries like germany and france were already resistant to the idea of giving a nato security guarantee to a country with an open dispute with russia i cant see how they can get the consensus of 26 states anytime soon
2208777 we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2208778 weve been encouraging everyone involved and every international party to engage in talks for years months days hours
2208779 we find ourselves in a situation similar to where the czechs were in 1968 to where the hungarians found themselves in 1956
2208780 the conflict might be short and hot but my sense is that neither party wants a prolonged conflict
2208781 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2208782 some members of the security council were somehow reluctant to call on the parties including georgia of course to refrain from the use of force and we think that this is a very serious blunder of judgment error of judgment and political blunder
2208783 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
2208784 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
2208785 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment

2208789 this is someone whos already come to terms with the fact that if he has to do a year possibly a year and a half on the custodial kidnapping charge

2208794 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2208795 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2208796 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2208797 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2208798 it takes you back to a very ugly time in history in texas when we killed people because of the color of their skin and their poverty

2208814 i think its more about the intelligence behind their music thats more of a compliment than an insult
2208815 i think they get a bad rap for being derivative especially of the beatles but thats just good music i dont think its a character flaw
2208816 were not virtuosos were just stylists and that will only take us so far were never gonna be playing 17 minute songs
2208817 weve played some of those festivals but i dont think we ever really killed

2208819 i know that im coming here and all i have to do is try to win the race i dont have to worry about points ive got no stress its just go out and have fun and thats a real rarity in spring cup competition you never are able to come to the race track without any stress
2208820 these next five races are win at all costs just get the wins get the bonus points
2208821 theres no way to tell right now whos got the best chance of winning the championship
2208822 theres enough teams that are running well right now theres a number of teams that can win every week and it seems like theres more people getting stronger as we go
2208823 yeah i think performance wise weve been really good this season
2208824 the four wins is a great number its a lot of wins at this point of the season the great part about it though is we gave away another two or three wins maybe even more so weve run well enough to win seven or eight races its all you can do in racing is be in a position and whatever you get is what you get
2208825 for us our team is really in a position right now where we dont have to worry too much about having a bad race but for a lot of the teams at the tail end of the chase field this tracks really important
2208826 you can have such a bad day here through a small mistake that this will be a little bit of a bottleneck for a lot of guys theres a lot of pressure this is really nice to come here without that pressure because i know how that feels

2208828 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest

2208836 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2208837 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2208838 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2208839 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level

2208849 both my wife and i both have to work 60 hours a week at two or three jobs and we can barely survive what happened
2208850 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2208851 canada has sought assurances that mr khadr under our government will be treated humanely
2208852 however that is all secondary to the larger issue and that is the republicans ousted clinton on a platform that was supposed to bring integrity back to the oval office so recent events must be of great concern to bush as well as the american people no matter which party you are beholding to
2208853 the ethics findings may be particularly upsetting to a president who came to office in 2000 vowing to restore integrity and honor to a white house that he said had been tainted by the recurring scandals of the clinton years
2208854 a majority of americans say the indictment of senior white house aide i
2208855 in the aftermath of the latest crisis to confront the white house bushs overall job approval rating has fallen to 39 percent the lowest of his presidency in post abc polls barely a third of americans 34 percent think bush is doing a good job ensuring high ethics in government which is slightly lower than president bill clintons standing on this issue when he left office
2208856 bushs low approval ratings will be of major concern to the white house and thats not good for the country because he will be more distracted with improving his tarnished image than governing
2208857 obviously the best thing for the republican party is to have this all end as quickly as possible
2208858 but at the end of the day you cannot ask a guy who all of us think is an upstanding and honorable guy to give up his legal rights
2208859 it is clear that senators would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents concerning advice provided during her tenure at the white house disclosures that would undermine a presidents ability to receive candid counsel

2208863 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2208864 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2208865 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
2208866 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
2208867 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
2208868 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
2208869 this threat made by mr martinoski was made in anger and on the spur of the moment nonetheless his language and conduct at the time of the threat were offensive and bullying
2208870 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
2208871 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
2208872 an exercise in absurdity made necessary by a daft law

2208895 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2208896 theyve got a heavy lift to convince the scientific world theyve nailed it

2208898 their case hinges on the fact that these strains came out of this particular flask
2208899 when you suspect someone of a crime of course you have to investigate but questioning people when you dont suspect them that is absurd
2208900 the main text of president bushs nationally televised address last night was the rebuilding of new orleans and the gulf coast but the clear subtext was the rebuilding of a presidency that is now at its lowest point ever confronted by huge and simultaneous challenges at home and abroad and facing a country divided along partisan and racial lines hurricane katrina struck at the core of bushs presidency by undermining the central assertion of his reelection campaign that he was a strong and decisive leader who could keep the country safe in a crisis never again will the white house be able to point to his often praised performance after the attacks of sept 11 2001 without skeptics recalling the fumbling and slow off the mark response of his administration after the hurricane and the flooding in new orleans his response to these criticisms last night was a speech largely shorn of soaring rhetoric and stirring turns of phrase of the kind that marked his efforts to rally the country after the terrorist attacks instead as if recognizing that his own road back will be one marked by steady but small steps he spoke with workmanlike focus spelling out the details of what has been done and will be done to help those displaced by the storm in again taking responsibility for the federal governments failures bush signaled last night that the white house has decided not to contest the widespread perceptions that his administration failed in the early days of the crisis by embracing those criticisms they hope to make the issue a sideshow that will play out sometime in the future instead after a halting start the white house appears intently focused on demonstrating the presidents capacity to manage the huge rebuilding effort ahead bushs advisers believe that despite the partisan finger pointing over what happened most americans are not looking back and will judge the president on what happens going forward but as iraq has shown over the past two years the facts on the ground shape public confidence in the president more than words or promises
2208901 katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government and to the extent the federal government didnt fully do its job right i take responsibility
2208902 its in our national interest that we find out exactly what went on so we can better respond
2208903 bush already has dispatched his top strategist deputy chief of staff karl rove and other aides to assemble ideas from agencies conservative think tanks gop lawmakers and state officials to guide the rebuilding of new orleans and relocation of flood victims the idea aides said is twofold provide a quick federal response that comports with bushs governing philosophy and prevent katrina from swamping his second term ambitions on social security taxes and middle east democracy building
2208904 the agreement was reached on the basis of a compromise proposal put forward by china in an effort to bridge differences between the united states and pyongyang over a north korean demand for a light water nuclear reactor to produce electricity the compromise suggested that north korea be accorded the right in principle to peaceful nuclear energy but only after dismantling its nuclear weapons program and rejoining the u n nuclear inspection regime and the nuclear non proliferation treaty
2208905 this was my mistake and im going to have to live with it
2208906 to put those numbers in some context the average us driver will use 580 gallons of fuel each year compared to 242 in the uk 139 percent more even allowing for fuel thats less than half the price 3 88 per gallon vs 8 52 per gallon currently us drivers are still poorer to the tune of nearly 200 a year
2208907 ms grants alleged prior actions are totally irrelevant to this suit
2208908 nascar must obey the law and should focus its full attention on improving the discriminatory and hostile work environment to which employees are subject

2208917 we will investigate put them before the court but its a concern in relation to their ages
2208918 our members have taken steps to ensure safety is not compromised he said
2208919 in our view the department of corrective services is not providing enough positions and on top of that they are threatening to remove more positions
2208920 certainly if the department provided the facility with more staff it would be possible to let patients out of the cells more often but they havent done that mr little said
2208921 if not normally then as close to normally as possible

2208934 a number of items have been located during the operation which will be subjected to further forensic analysis to determine their relevance to the ongoing investigation
2208935 since the operation began on monday detectives have received a number of calls from members of public with new information
2208936 this information has provided detectives with additional lines of inquiry which are being investigated

2208941 googles soc is a formal sponsorship program tailored specifically to open source
2208942 my primary role has changed from developing drupal web sites myself to consulting with large clients such as mtv sony bmg records bbc and popular science magazine that use drupal my job is to help train their developers help architect web sites mapping wireframes to drupal functionality and to impart best practices and advice that ive picked up from working in the drupal community over the past three years lullabot also gives us time built into our working schedule to work on drupal itself
2208943 an internship is a nice opportunity for both an employer and an employee to size each other up to see if theyd be a good match and real world experience will always trump anything you read in a book
2208944 ive been mostly self taught but i went to school to help fill in some of the gaps
2208945 one of my instructors ian macleod mentioned gsoc it sounded like a wonderful opportunity to me id had a love of open source basically since i first heard the term in the late 90s but i had always lacked the confidence to believe that i could be part of it to be able to get my foot in the door and to be paid to do it at the same time was basically a dream opportunity so i applied figuring what the heck
2208946 someone reading about gsoc might come away thinking the sole goal of the program is for open source organizations to use googles money to pay students to work on much neglected or much needed features
2208947 what a sweet deal however i believe gsoc is more about attracting and retaining talent to an open source project than it is about producing fantastic code
2208948 i would much rather have only semi fantastic code from a student who stays on with the project long term and gets involved in other aspects such as documentation and core development than a 100 working thing of beauty from a student who we never hear from again after gsoc is finished
2208949 students work on something fun that they enjoy and get paid to do it
2208950 it greatly lowers the barrier of entry to getting involved in an open source project
2208951 and if they cant help you they know someone else who can
2208952 its a great way to bug test your documentation to see if its easy for new people to get up to speed
2208953 potentially long term contributors get completely immersed and start taking on additional roles in the project since open source projects thrive on contributors the opportunity to obtain more of them is a huge benefit
2208954 working in open source effectively gives you an open resume
2208955 instead of taking you at your word your employer can actually look at your code and see its progression from when you first started on a project until now they can view your interactions with fellow community members and see how you can effectively solve problems in a team environment you demonstrate your ability to use collaboration tools necessary for serious software development
2208956 this program served to completely shatter the myths i had about how open source projects worked i thought everyone who works on open source is this enormous genius with a huge brain and is some sort of god of programming which paralyzed me from getting involved in open source for nearly 10 years

2209001 if we look at the terrain that the nigerian economy is you will realize that poverty is obviously still the number one national challenge and if the data of a survey conducted in 2004 is to be disaggregated state by state you will come to the reality that between the 70s and 90s largest chunk of the poverty appeared to be in the north
2209002 when it comes to celebrating our love for the great canadian lager size does matter
2209003 this is a question of precedent people have been making wood carvings drinking dancing wildly and then having raucously cathartic orgies all in my name for nearly three millennia even at less formal affairs the offerings have always been made and we among the party gods have collected our fair share this mega keg undermines a time tested system of drink inspired bad decisions
2209004 the spread of islam across africa and the middle east has had a significant impact upon our pantheon the last fifteen hundred years have seen more and more progressive belt tightening measures in ras court in addition to multi faith competition our rituals and rites are now easily accessible on the internet but that does not make it legal to use them without our permission idol worship is our intellectual property

2209009 assuming without conceding that government has been subsidising petroleum products to the tune of n1 5 trillion the blame for this should be squarely placed at the doorstep of the government which has woefully failed to build functional and local refineries that can make the prices of petroleum products much cheaper than those being imported from europe and america
2209010 in an economic environment where most industries and individuals are forced to rely on petrol and diesel to generate their power needs any increment in prices of petroleum products would only increase the overall cost of goods and services a phenomenon which would only compound an already aggravated situation

2209027 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
2209028 that is what most americans most military spouses are saying thats our tendency in this nation to say that i am blessed because we are in so many ways were blessed to live in this country were blessed to have the opportunities that we have but sometimes things just still arent right

2209047 universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
2209048 we just dont believe in chasing efficiencies at the expense of the interests of the people who fund the service we dont want to centralise to such an extent that the less populated areas end up losing services
2209049 we cant lose sight of the fact that our landholders pay for the service and they expect their money to be spent in their local area
2209050 in our area blocks are getting bigger and these people take their primary production business very seriously the threats of exotic disease outbreaks or weed infestations affect their bottom line in the more populated areas where blocks are getting smaller as tree changers move in they dont share the same priorities
2209051 if its done right this is our big opportunity to do things better get top quality staff keep jobs local and improve our services to our ratepayers

2209065 its not so much what you put in the paper but what you dont
2209066 scientists are smiling at the citys chances of landing disease lab
2209067 really what we have here is an arrogance of power
2209068 it is so discouraging to me to see the public be so gullible

2209074 i am today notifying the department of homeland security that i do not support locating the national bio agro defense facility nbaf at the proposed butner site

2209076 the information from the 1million central nsw transport needs study will inform the federal government on how they will spend the 20billion they have set aside to get infrastructure in the country back to where it should be
2209077 this 1m is the first part of a 5m commitment to the centroc region and it is my view that we should spend the least on plans and the most on on ground works
2209078 i want to see action before the next federal election
2209079 the timing for the study is very tight though and the mayors of the centroc region have been asked to form the reference panel to inform the federal government of the current issues and concerns in our community
2209080 we have also been requested to ask our citizens about their concerns regarding transport
2209081 the central nsw transport needs study is looking at the big picture
2209082 for example road and rail links for passenger and freight for the next 25 years intermodal terminals like those at parkes and blayney and tourism linkages through the region
2209083 it is not about where we should put traffic lights or roundabouts so i am asking the people of parkes shire who are interested to give me feedback regarding this big picture stuff
2209084 people can also make submissions direct to central west study rta nsw gov au
2209085 the fact is we have to be there and make our voices heard to ensure that the federal government knows that transport infrastructure improvements are vital to this region especially the upgrade of the bells line of road
2209086 centroc councils are unanimous in their call for the sequestering of the corridor for the bells line of expressway as soon as possible
2209087 the rta and skm have arranged the next meeting of the reference group of mayors from centroc
2209088 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
2209089 archbishop orombi isnt the first person who has used this language of colonial relics about the canterbury relationship i think its a misunderstanding really it would be fair only if canterbury governed now i dont govern the communion

2209108 we kept thinking that as long as we paid him the rent we would be all right
2209109 this last landlord he didnt even seem like the type who would do that to somebody but what is the type
2209110 early on the focus was all on the homeowners problems
2209111 its only now that the renters dilemma is bubbling up to the top
2209112 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2209113 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2209114 the housing crisis that we all observe as we drive home every single day continues to strain our results and our capital
2209115 were trying to create a synergistic environment between the businesses the faculty and the students
2209116 start up companies will have a place to be nurtured grow and then grow into the business park
2209117 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2209118 we think that the general market is being moved along by the surprising strength of the dollar which is exacerbating the slide in oil prices so all positive for stocks
2209119 and i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2209120 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness

2209122 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2209123 given the economy i thought it would be a bit slower
2209124 i used to come here for the dining the movie theater
2209125 those things we did retain we enjoy them more because theyre not spread out over a five bedroom house in upper bethesda

2209127 do i potty train my older kid or do i help my youngest learn how to speak
2209128 youve got open space and youre putting buildings on it
2209129 an indoor pool i dont know how that would quite fit
2209130 frankly we think a lot of these kinds of facilities are very important to parkgoers and recreation users around the state
2209131 its a long standing practice our interpretation is that indoor facilities are supportive of outdoor recreation
2209132 there is some basis in law for the departments longstanding interpretation
2209133 there is a tension that has developed throughout the years
2209134 i think this is something the legislature should look at
2209135 the internet though far less costly than television has become a major marketing tool of food companies that target children and adolescents with more than two thirds of the 44 companies reporting online youth directed activities
2209136 this study confirms what i have been saying for years industry needs to step up to the plate and use their innovation and creativity to market healthy foods to our kids
2209137 that 1 6 billion could be used to attract our kids to healthy snacks tasty cereals fruits and vegetables
2209138 open an investigation into the circumstances that precipitated the recent distress in the shares prices of freddie mac

2209140 its been clear that what we have been focused on is shoring up fannie mae and freddie mac and instilling confidence in them and thats all
2209141 we were halfway to great falls that was the frontier you had to go to arlington to find something to eat

2209145 im so used to keeping my eye on you i would never have been able to concentrate
2209146 how can you swing a club let alone get a hole in one after breaking your ribs your hip and shoulder thats amazing you had me thinking you might not even walk again
2209147 it was a script submitted to me about nine years ago
2209148 at the time it was about a bunch of teenagers who worked in a mall which we thought was an absolutely great concept
2209149 we noticed how to add more and more music and still keep the story moving forward it felt like you got to a certain part of the script and you just went music when i started watching every musical i could trying to understand why i liked them so much i realized music didnt stop the story and added depth to the characters
2209150 a lot of the other cast members had been involved with the project for months doing very intensive auditions
2209151 i got really lucky i had only two auditions in the space of a week then a week later we were ready to shoot
2209152 and i really loved it plus it was an amazing group of people we got along really well in real life
2209153 theres been a lot more of it over the past few years which is really fabulous
2209154 when i was in college moulin rouge came out and my friends and i obsessed over it it was the first musical that had come out in a long long time
2209155 i love playing villains theyre just delicious i try to make every person i play her own character as opposed to oh its just the ingenue i think maggie gyllenhaal does that she makes every part special and not just the girlfriend i admire that
2209156 he doesnt know he likes me and i dont know i like him i mean i do know i like him but he doesnt know i mean yea

2209158 i did for an hour i burned 375 calories and i read my book the whole time score
2209159 the best exercise is pushing yourself away from the table
2209160 you can be a tigger or an eeyore kristin you choose
2209161 you better decide early on if youre a tigger or an eeyore tiggers are energetic theyre optimistic theyre curious theyre enthusiastic and they have fun and never ever underestimate the importance of having fun
2209162 moral and political questions that put the integrity of the tribunal into doubt
2209163 the verdict has raised very serious and weighty legal and moral as well as political issues that deserve public attention the legal issues raised would of course soon be a matter for the appeal court to examine and consider the moral and political issues on the other hand are in the realm of the curious and the absurd that affront fairness and equity
2209164 it must be curious to all discerning minds that the bulk of the nullified results come from governor agagus stronghold the ondo south senatorial district which constitute the governors home base
2209165 the tribunal had all the time in this world to prepare the judgment prior to its delivery it could therefore not have been working on or is it re writing it unless it had to do so to conform the text to the apparently absurd verdict
2209166 not permitted in law which means in effect that the tribunals verdict cannot stand even on this basis alone
2209167 we shall meet at the appeal to upturn the verdict
2209168 the governor elect dr olusegun mimiko proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was the duly elected governor of the state dr mimiko called credible witnesses who testified that election was either marred with irregularities or failed to hold in the contested areas
2209169 where were those who are calling for the heads of the panel members when agagu was unable to bring witnesses
2209170 but for the electoral act which limits it to court of appeal anybody can still go to the supreme court if he wishes
2209171 why they are saying all these things is that the tribunal had to abridge its ruling
2209172 we were expecting in okitipupa where fola ewegbemi signed and even for the reason the second election panel nullified the election of two contestants in agagus constituency we were hoping that the tribunal would have nullified the election and at the end of the day agagu would have scored less than 100 000 but the tribunal was lenient to him and we accepted the judgment out of four local governments they nullified two in its entirety if they said they want to go to appeal fine but i can tell you he would lose again
2209173 it is give and take thing we expected the cancellation of okitipupa local government but they did not on the judgments of panel two on irele local government we are already in court because what they did there was based on technicalities with the prevalent situation then we know why those things happened
2209174 you dont just make allegations that bother on criminality just to show off and that you are not happy with the outcome of the election so it would not be easy to prove the allegation the law says you must prove beyond reasonable doubt these allegations were accepted by the tribunal like someone was just drinking water it is unbelievable it is a great shock i think that if a party is to lose it will be because of a cogent reason
2209175 i think after the judgment of the court of appeal and we have succeeded it would begin to be clear that people should stop using the court to gain through the back door what they lost on the field
2209176 the position of our party is that the judgment is unacceptable and it is rejected in its entirety we have every reason to believe that the judgment was not well considered it was lacking in soundness the evidences that we adduced and canvassed before the tribunal was not appraised evaluated and correct deductions made before the judgment were arrived at we have every reason to believe that we will succeed at the level of appeal in the light of the evidence before the court what was read fell short of standard of balance and sound judgment
2209177 at the time the expectations of ondo state citizenry indicated preference for the coming together of all progressive forces away from and against agagus pdp only the positively minded and well meaning politicians were capable of its discernment
2209178 but while some of the governorship candidates who contested the april 14 election with agagu conspired with him you sacrificed your exalted position as a minister risked the possibility of total political extinction posed by the challenges and the stack realities of the day to chart a new course for the emancipation of the people of the state we share with you that you did not backslide from doing the biddings of the poor masses of the state at that critical moment when your leadership was required
2209179 justice nabaruma has resuscitated and enlivened in ondo state a democracy thrown into a state of coma darkness has departed now and light has been restored he has added yet another feather to his cap and a unique dimension to his intimidating track record of uprightness and patriotism
2209180 the appellate court has found grounds to dismiss the judgment of the tribunals in many instances of recent including that of david mark and others so the last has definitely not been heard on the matter and those jubilating should hold on until that time
2209181 the judges erred by their verdict which gave order for outright declaration
2209182 towards reaching an agreement that would bring about a smooth transfer of power from agagu to mimiko
2209183 arrangement is necessary because there is the possibility of the appellate court ruling in favour of a re run which in essence would mean a fresh four year term for agagu
2209184 he is so corrupt that he will want to be close to authority so that he will not be arrested to answer for all he did
2209185 no normal human being will want to do what he is doing
2209186 if the chairman of the pdp comes from the south the position of bot chairman goes to the north automatically
2209187 when solomon lar was the chairman of pdp alex ekweme was the chairman bot lar acted as bot chairman because there was a vacum
2209188 also it was back again to the south when tony anenih was the bot chairman and the chairman of the party was from the north
2209189 this competitive deficit translates into foregone income and lost jobs whilst not everyone agrees on the exact amount of investment needed to bridge nigerias infrastructure gap everyone agrees that it far exceeds what the government budget could ever finance alone
2209190 the same is true for the subsequent maintenance and recurrent costs required to keep the infrastructure working just to give you an idea of the order of magnitude for africa it would need 22 billion every year for infrastructure investment plus another 18 billion every year for operations and maintenance
2209191 give me a directory and i play the files there
2209192 we have put this team together at short notice but the guys have been tested and proven and they will ultimately produce the results
2209193 but as a patriotic guyanese i wish them the best and hope that they will come out on top
2209194 from what ive read in the media i dont think they had the best of preparation but im hoping for the best for them
2209195 and while i dont know the composition of the team i know there are players who have the tenacity that will do guyana well
2209196 we beat suriname last year in the cup finals and despite the fact that they suriname beat us in back to back games a few weeks ago in the world cup qualifier im optimistic that this time around guyana will prevail
2209197 after that game collie hercules and nigel codrington went back to their clubs and showed remarkable form and as a matter of fact both of them are among the top three leading goalscorers in the trinidad pro league codrington has 10 or 11 goals to his name in the league to date and hercules is just one goal behind him and added to that konata mannings is back to full fitness and form
2209198 while we have not seen the dominicans play since 2006 the fact is we have the same group of players who have been tested and proven so our chances this evening are good
2209199 the government has known about the problem since the 1980s
2209200 the river is a mess it is a national disgrace they blame global warming and everything else but they do nothing
2209201 we havent had floods since the 1970s not a decent one i am angry about this river and what has happened to it it was a beautiful river and now it is a hazard
2209202 they would swing ropes into the river go canoeing fishing catch yabbies
2209203 this was a magic place now theres nothing when the kids come back with their kids they dont catch anything
2209204 this is quite a natural stoppage this is one of the events where there is a lack of rain
2209205 but with the advent of irrigation on this river we are amplifying the drought these are the worst conditions i have ever seen
2209206 ecologically it is doing a lot of damage within the flood plains billabongs creeks and flood runs
2209207 they allocated more water than it is possible to take out of the system
2209208 we have 15 000 hectares of irrigated wheat in that looks absolutely magnificent we often get tagged as just being a cotton operation well we are not
2209209 this year we have grown sorghum sunflowers wheat we will be growing some cotton at the end of the year and it is highly likely we will grow some soybeans during summer
2209210 the demand for food is driving prices up so it makes these other crops look quite attractive
2209211 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalised lack of empowerment to claim goods and services
2209212 we have goals that are clearly achievable and within reach but at the same time we want to continue to push forward and stretch
2209213 with the escalating prices of energy and fuel it will only become more attractive down the road
2209214 for 54 of filipinos people have only themselves to blame for typhoons flooding landslides and other calamities that occurred in the philippines and other countries in recent months

2209226 at yaw opare krom in the suaman constituency the ndc mp hon snk ackah got into open confrontation with our party agents when they requested for forms to challenge the citizenship of people who could not speak any ghanaian language nor had residence in the constituency but had been brought for registration by the mp also at osei kwadwokrom yametwa and kaase all in the bia constituency the ndc mp hon boampong also brought a group of people who neither spoke any ghanaian language nor had residence in the constituency to be registered
2209227 in the offinso north constituency of the ashanti region many
2209228 there was also the issuance of fresh birth certificates to a large army of minors at nkenkanso to enable them to circumvent the process this illegality was no doubt orchestrated by the npp to have unfair advantage in the election
2209229 only sports widely practiced by men in at least seventy five countries and on four continents and by women in at least forty countries and on three continents may be included in the programme of the games of the olympiad
2209230 to be included in the programme of the olympic games events must have a recognized international standing both numerically and geographically and have been included at least twice in world or continental championships
2209231 only sports that apply the olympic movement anti doping code and in particular perform out of competition testing in accordance with the rules of the world anti doping agency will be included in the programme of the olympic games
2209232 sports disciplines or events in which performance depends essentially on mechanical propulsion are not acceptable
2209233 baldness can be caused by emotional stress sexual frustration etc
2209234 bald men are more virile or sexually active than others
2209235 a federal court of appeals on friday ruled that using reclaimed wastewater to make artificial snow at a flagstaff ski resort does not violate the religious freedom of native americans at issue was whether the possibility of residual human waste in the reclaimed water estimated at 0001 percent desecrated lands held sacred by several tribes
2209236 the healthier system would allow more flows through the darling and into nsw there is water available in the darling basin and its for sale
2209237 buying these properties would be a win win win for the environment for the communities in the basin and for willing sellers

2209245 on tuesday september 30th at 1 30 pm alongside the fabulous
2209246 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all
2209247 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
2209248 the spice girls reunion tour was a very healing experience for me it put to bed every bit of doubt guilt insecurity i had about leaving the girls when i did i felt id made amends with them
2209249 the legislation is called the employee free choice act and i am sad to say it runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard efca risks silencing those who would speak
2209250 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
2209251 southern california edison has more than 20 years and 16 million ev miles of experience operating the nations largest fleet of electric vehicles this new ev collaboration with mitsubishi complements sces existing work on plug in hybrids and next generation advanced batteries and their effective connection and control by edisons next generation meters
2209252 i kept on a read zone right around the outside and went to turn up and just couldnt do what i nomally did
2209253 its just a little bit sore i didnt go down i just did a little hop and skip and they came to check me out and put a little ice on it
2209254 charlie is fighting for his freedom but also fighting for the rights of others
2209255 we experienced favorable weather especially at night entertainment was awesome incidents were down and i really appreciate the responsible well mannered crowds
2209256 our junior livestock program remains one of the strongest in the entire state of california and our community continues to generously support the kids year after year
2209257 of course the soft economy trickles down and does have an effect on everybody
2209258 well start the bidding and get it going and then get off if it seems like theyll get their money
2209259 we try to protect the kids from parkfield shandon paso and templeton
2209260 i take a few thousand dollars and make sure the kids bring in enough money try to help out the market some we get some we dont but we add money to keep the bidding process going we help out the kids that have a low price help bring up the price so they make enough money for their efforts
2209261 socialize discuss issues and find out how you can help
2209262 we are in negotiations with target for the anchor position in our shopping center
2209263 we feel they are going to add great value to our city
2209264 it certainly is the most requested retailer that we get
2209265 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2209266 you start to lose your memory you start to lose your confidence you start to lose your invention so i think thats pretty much a closed book for me
2209267 were happy we think the city council understood our issue we believe the decision they made really reflects what the citizens of paso robles want
2209268 these conditions will be used as a model for other downtown entertainment establishments that are pursuing their own use permits
2209269 we are kind of having a perfect storm of difficulties
2209270 for a lot of people its probably a temporary situation
2209271 maybe they just lost a home or went bankrupt but its a substantial part of the current increase in demand
2209272 people can be so generous but they are having a hard time meeting their own needs right now
2209273 cutting back on service would be the absolute last resort and we hope never to do that
2209274 very very small distribution that these people will get in a month or two
2209275 we had secured a lot of pro bono work during the boom in the building industry but then the economy took a downturn and a lot of people didnt have the discretionary income to get involved
2209276 the problem cant get fixed i want to go back to work i want to go back to work at the sheriffs department
2209277 are done validating the signatures now they have to enter it all into the computer match it up with our account numbers thats when theyll get the final count
2209278 as he said yesterday theres going to be a lot of good bills that come down that hell have to veto
2209279 why arent we trying to connect suburbs with urban areas the central valley with the bay area
2209280 that rail is much more achievable sooner than looking at a 30 year investment that is relying on the hope of the private sector to come in
2209281 though this might be a step in the right direction in oversight i think its the wrong direction for the needs of the state today
2209282 horses are supposed to be protected if people dont pay attention before they know it there are not going to be any wild horses and i think thatll be a great loss
2209283 the bottom line is weve run out of things to do with these animals
2209284 there are pros and cons to each method but were not at that point
2209285 the potential for wholesale killing of thousands of healthy wild horses marks a complete turnaround in management policy
2209286 living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west
2209287 to set the record straight euthanasia is mercy killing thats certainly not whats being proposed here by any stretch of the imagination
2209288 its killing pure and simple to balance the books for an agency whose reckless management has caused immeasurable harm to a national treasure
2209289 is a longstanding concern and must not be used as a death sentence
2209290 any time they talk about killing wild horses its disturbing
2209291 what its going to take is a public outcry to hopefully reverse that kind of thinking people need to contact their legislators
2209292 wed be on the news if we had kids wed do something horrible to them or leave them somewhere
2209293 no i shouldnt say that wed do horrible things to them i just mean that well i couldnt give them the constant love that they need
2209294 look for her playing the girl in the bumper cars and the girl on the carousel
2209295 two days later she got a call shed gotten the job
2209296 alexis says it was a lot of work but fun being on the set of a carnival the best part was she got to ride the carousel until 2 a m although it did make her a little dizzy after awhile
2209297 when she went airborne and hit her head on the slide
2209298 any time theres a head injury a doctor should take a look
2209299 we found out about it when the father of the juvenile contacted me to make a complaint about our officer
2209300 the father obviously took the matter very seriously because of what was allegedly being said
2209301 i really dont know if anyone has any further information we ask that they step forward i dont know how many kids would tell their parents theyre being investigated by police but maybe once they read this story theyll call us
2209302 all too often innocent law abiding people suffer tragic consequences and the loss of loved ones due to this careless disregard for human life
2209303 well be especially vigilant during high risk nighttime hours when impaired drivers are most likely to be on the road
2209304 our message is simple and unwavering if we find you driving impaired we will arrest you no exceptions
2209305 all maine state parks and historic sites offer unique experiences for visitors
2209306 this year i hope residents will take advantage of maine day to travel to a property that they have never been to
2209307 whether its close by or 100 miles away this is the day to get to the place youve always wanted to visit
2209308 when the individual was asked he did admit that he had a weapon on him
2209309 at that point it heightens the awareness of those on the checkpoint both police and secret service
2209310 there was at least enough probable cause to stop him as well as a need to talk to this individual
2209311 if we wait until next spring were looking at crunch time for the first virginia class submarine which is coming at the end of 2010
2209312 as much as anything can be in d c its a lock
2209313 what i can tell you is that the senator is very aware of this project and is working hard to keep the bill moving in the senate
2209314 critical to our future were the best in the business and were doing our work in a 60 year old outdated mess
2209315 this legislation will ensure it remains on the cutting edge and the best in the fleet
2209316 it was a little slow in may but once the schools let out in june
2209317 ive been pleased and surprised and i didnt hold out high hopes
2209318 to be honest i did not anticipate a great summer
2209319 we sell the things you want not necessarily the things you need
2209320 most of our guests are from new england or are canadians
2209321 once they get their heating bills well vacations and going out to dinner are the first things to go
2209322 the hotel owners are telling me that reservations look good for the fall
2209323 but i worry about oil prices people getting their bills and looking at them this time of year
2209324 in the fall we get a lot of european customers
2209325 they usually have no children or their children are grown and they have more money to spend
2209326 our hotels are full our stores are busy and its hard getting a dinner reservation around here
2209327 for july 4th we had a beautiful weather weekend and some businesses had their best weekend ever
2209328 some businesses are down but a lot more are holding their own and doing better than anticipated
2209329 we hope to not only continue but expand the efforts in the future
2209330 we believe that with your help this will be possible the tournament is only one way of helping these great charities
2209331 the hall is used to provide a gathering place that anyone can use
2209332 the uniqueness of the area will be lost if we dont continue to make the repairs and renovations
2209333 at the beginning of this summer we set an artificial deadline to get the plan to the state by aug 15 knowing full well that we may or may not get there by that time but we at least needed a door to walk through
2209334 as long as the selectmen are talking and moving forward then im convinced the plan will move forward
2209335 this is a critical issue for us as the rsu 57 committee
2209336 we need to sit back and see what is in the best interest of all the communities
2209337 the campaign has decided to seek federal judicial review of a decision that has troubling near term and long term ramifications for the constitutional rights of maine citizens
2209338 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office
2209339 any large extraction contracts and to support the enactment of an ordinance to regulate extraction
2209340 it is very important that we let our kkw trustees and town selectpeople know we are serious about protecting our water and that it should be a public trust
2209341 this proposal presents an immediate sustainable and environmentally conscientious solution to our waste problem
2209342 and this solution is also an intriguing economic development opportunity with great potential to attract new business create good jobs and propel maine forward on the path to clean sustainable energy development
2209343 kids were running and jumping there was a lot of joy and appreciation
2209344 if you go into it and say its so depressing youre not going to make any difference
2209345 you do hold peoples hands as they die but what you bring away from that is their stories and its a celebration of their stories
2209346 they sing all the time youre eating your eggs and its like a choir coming out of the kitchen it really bonds them
2209347 they have nothing and they are just the strongest people because they have to be
2209348 they have little bits i have little bits and everybodys willing to teach
2209349 you tell their story and you can help the next generation
2209350 the community has supported me i want them to know theyve created an amazing change in the world
2209351 the reason its an important story is that it makes you reflect
2209352 it may be summertime in maine but winter is on the mind of many maine people
2209353 it is time we begin working together to do what we can before the temperature drops
2209354 i know we are in serious trouble this winter especially for the elderly we have to do something to help these people out
2209355 i am hearing the concerns throughout the district and i am going to do everything in my capacity as state senator to work for solutions and relief
2209356 its two hours of really wonderful skill and of sophisticated youth performers really having a good time with what they are great at
2209357 if people think youth circus and they are unsure they should definitely be sure because they put out a ton of energy and put on something really amazing its hard to describe the show because part of me doesnt want to give it away
2209358 its basically if dr seuss wrote a science themed book
2209359 its a bizarre science done through great skill and its had many people leave the tent just buzzing
2209360 one of the really wonderful things for us is that they are a nonprofit but that they do these shows so that other organizations can raise money too
2209361 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
2209362 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all
2209363 if kids dont have the information lets get it to them
2209364 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
2209365 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
2209366 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
2209367 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
2209368 you can find yourself saying im getting tired of looking at all death records so you change to another type of record
2209369 some of the records we have we got by mistake whether its from another town or another state
2209370 and part of the oath is that he wont divulge that information because the town wouldnt have that information anyway
2209371 you look in the documents and many times there is information in these books that families were required to report but they didnt want the world to find out
2209372 some records he had trouble reading so someone else had to take oath and help him to read the script writing
2209373 i dont quite know how many hours he put into this project but it has to be hundreds and hundreds of hours
2209374 as long as bush has been here theres been a reason to march
2209375 were all politically active in this area if there is a just cause that we believe in then were there
2209376 when the president moves from one place to another or if he is out on the property or if there is a general security concern then the police adjust for that situation possibly by creating roadblocks with detours
2209377 this is the first time weve been here for this for a laidback kind of town its pretty interesting that a president lives here
2209378 what some people are calling the most important moment in modern chinese history
2209379 we need a cultural analyst ann you look asian want to take a crack at this
2209380 people from all over the country were flocking into the office
2209381 we have suggested donation levels for our items but we are thrilled about the number of people who have chosen to donate over and above these levels
2209382 i cant i cant i cant get anything done cause im having too much fun
2209383 i dont need drugs i dont need help ill fuck it up all by myself deepak chopra kiss my ass ive got advice for you i say fuck it
2209384 although weve only had four nominations for the bathurst election so far there have been quite a few people come in to our offices at 126 bentinck street and pick up nomination forms
2209385 so were expecting a bit of a late rush as the candidates start to signal their intentions
2209386 everyone that has been in however are very enthusiastic about running for council because they really want to have a say in the future of bathurst
2209387 ive heard we can expect to end up with anything from 15 20 candidates
2209388 it should be noted there is no absentee voting at local government elections
2209389 it has to be either a postal vote or a pre poll vote that can be made anytime from monday september 1
2209390 after then we will also know the line up of candidates and all the official polling places
2209391 at this stage we do know the memorial entertainment centre wont be available because of a clash with the bathurst eisteddfod
2209392 however the principle polling place will be the catholic parish centre in keppell street
2209393 china has an ancient culture and this shows how the culture has developed
2209394 at the end of the day the people of bathurst should receive the level of protection that they are paying for
2209395 they are paying the exact same amount as people in the greater sydney area but are receiving an inferior service
2209396 i have made contact with the minister for emergency services nathan rees to find out where bathurst fits in on the time line
2209397 bathurst has not been overlooked but it needs to be addressed
2209398 the firefighters said what normally happens is when they need a new truck a station in the metropolitan area secures the upgrade and we get one that is six or seven years old
2209399 so the questions is why dont we get a brand new one a truck that is six or seven years old does the same job but it is certainly an issue the union raised that needs to be answered
2209400 i believe that the unions submission asking for five per cent in the first year and then four per cent for two succeeding years is a responsible claim
2209401 the new south wales fire brigades safety record is second to none and i would oppose any negotiations that would compromise this
2209402 its only now that the renters dilemma is bubbling up to the top
2209403 most of these renters will be able to find new rentals so really they are only being inconvenienced
2209404 most of these renters will be able to find new rentals so really they are only being inconvenienced
2209405 renters just being inconvenienced must be coming from non renters or those who only rented when they were students or only had a couple of suitcases to move
2209406 former wallaby rugby union marty roebuck was presented with his medal as he was unable to attend the previous induction ceremony as he was away on world cup commitments at the time
2209407 the inductees were pretty humble about all the fuss but we know they must have had a feeling of jubilation when they walked out the door
2209408 they should be proud of their achievements they certainly do deserve to be recognised
2209409 hopefully there will be plenty more international sporting honours come bathursts way in the not too distant future
2209410 bathurst has proved to be a real breeding ground for some great sportspeople and tuesday nights function was testimony to that fact
2209411 we believe the relevance of this decision may be lost if notification is delivered to prospective and existing customers too far in advance of cmas commercial availability

2209415 there were once two brothers one ran away to sea the other was elected vice president and neither was heard of again
2209416 stodgy concept of the vice presidency and turned it on its ear
2209417 when you think about the process of becoming president its a two year process but for the vp they get nominated by one person and all of a sudden they are the second most powerful person in the country
2209418 they werent great looking they werent particularly good sounding guys they just did their jobs
2209419 young and outside of washington enough to be considered the question becomes is he ready for the national spotlight
2209420 oil production and the environmental concerns with the wildlife and keeping the tundra area pure and clean those are not mutually exclusive they are very compatible
2209421 the tundra looks exactly the same the terrain looks the same
2209422 these extreme conditions present even in the best months of summer are evidence of the core point members learned firsthand from tours and briefings during the trip anwrs 10 02 proposed drilling area coastal region is a remote and desolate site
2209423 the group saw the most wildlife bachmann said right at
2209424 being human and tripping over your tongue occasionally doesnt mean a thing
2209425 the 11 member delegation led by house republican leader john boehner of ohio made it to prudhoe bay but had to be content with an aerial tour of anwrs foggy coastal plain

2209427 there is no way on gods green earth a successful politician can keep insiting they didnt say what they did say on a daily basis
2209428 he does not think that now is the time for saber rattling towards iran
2209429 senator obama clearly recognizes the serious threat posed by iran
2209430 he thinks that our large troop presence in iraq has served to strengthen iran not weaken it
2209431 senator obama clearly recognizes the serious threat posed by iran however he does not agree with the president that the best way to counter that threat is to keep large numbers of troops in iraq and he does not think that now is the time for saber rattling towards iran in fact he thinks that our large troop presence in iraq has served to strengthen iran not weaken it he believes that diplomacy and economic pressure such as the divestment bill that he has proposed is the right way to pressure the iranian regime accordingly he would have opposed the kyl lieberman amendment had he been able to vote today
2209432 it is important to have tough sanctions on iran particularly on the iranian revolutionary guard which supports terrorism but these sanctions must not be linked to any attempt to keep our troops in iraq or to take military action against iran unfortunately the kyl lieberman amendment made the case for president bush that we need to use our military presence in iraq to counter iran a case that has nothing to do with sanctioning the revolutionary guard
2209433 there is no meaningful amount of oil in the arctic refuge not even a single years worth of us consumption which of course you wouldnt get all at once
2209434 im hoping jay will post something too because hes usually pretty good at explaining the economics of commodities
2209435 itd kinda be like sitting on a buch of confederate dollar bills shoulda used em before 1865
2209436 and half of iraq the western northern portion of iraq is going to be called the iraq state of islam something like that and im sorry i dont have the official name but its meant to be the training ground for the terrorists theres already an agreement made
2209437 they are going to get half of iraq and that is going to be a terrorist safe haven zone where they can go ahead and bring about more terrorist attacks in the middle east region and then to come against the united states because we are their avowed enemy
2209438 you have to admit proposing the federal or state government get into the business of drilling and refining oil is not exactly a capitalistic view of the world your right s c1alism jumps immediately to mind
2209439 as food prices are also rising we could also have the government plow under a few thousand acres of national forest and start raising corn right
2209440 we need to end the ethanol mandate immediately to lower fuel and food costs and help the environment
2209441 the notion that ethanol results in skyrocketing food costs is a falacy
2209442 viewed this as a campaign event and therefore they said he should not come
2209443 sen obama is welcome to visit landstuhl or any military hospital in his official capacity as a united states senator
2209444 but there is a dod policy which governs campaigning and electioneering at military facilities that would have to be respected if he were to visit that distinction was relayed and made clear to campaign and they made a decision on their own based on that guidance
2209445 this last troubling bit of information suggests barack obamas true religious problem its not that hes a muslim its that hes a jehovahs witness
2209446 we have longstanding department of defense policy in regards to political campaigns and elections
2209447 we informed the obama staff that he was more than welcome to visit as senator obama with senate staff however he could not conduct the visit with campaign staff
2209448 gee dtsi i guess you missed all the photos and videos of the troops wanting to see obama
2209449 in the videos ive seen almost all of the troops seen were black
2209450 d2 you say 1 patriotic soldiers dont support obama 2 the ones supporting obama are black
2209451 im sure that the vast majority of black soldiers dont support obama
2209452 i dont think that john mccain has a great choice none of these candidates would be a game changer somebody like michael bloomberg would be

2209458 five days later we met our new daughter nicki at the l a airport wearing the only clothing cindy could find on the trip back a 7 up t shirt she bought in the bangkok airport
2209459 well cnc if youve got some proof besides the national enquirer story by all means send it to them
2209460 sure ot everything obama says is a lie and every lie mccain

2209477 ein abtreter mit kokosborsten oder auch eine automatte mit niedrigem textilem flor l sst sich mit deckender stoffmalfarbe oder auch mit spezieller teppichfarbe bemalen
2209478 die farbe muss richtig tief in die borsten eingearbeitet werden
2209479 auch sisal kann bemalt werden das ist allerdings deutlich schwieriger
2209480 das motiv wird mit einem eddingstift aufgezeichnet und dann mit einem scharfen teppichmesser oder einem skalpell ausgeschnitten

2209485 i wasnt going to bail out i committed to milwaukee the tournament held the same week as the british in january i was ranked 100 something in the world then so who would have ever thought
2209486 its been a dream season for me it all fell into place milwaukee has been huge in my career keeping me going it means a lot to me the fans welcomed me with open arms
2209487 it was pretty funny when i turned on the tv pat perez was in an interview from royal birkdale he just shot 82 he said it was blowing sideways and sleet was hitting him he said kenny perrys the smartest man in the world i kind of chuckled but i couldnt win the claret jug where i was at
2209488 this is my favorite major im a golf course owner and i just feel like this tournament is the heart and soul of the pga and im just proud to be a part of it
2209489 to me a win here would be icing on the cake ive been able to win 12 times but putting has always held me back in majors next year maybe i need to focus on winning one and see if i can do that ive never really tried to do that i always tried to show up and play and do my best and whatever it fell i was happy with that
2209490 in 22 years nobody cared where i played all of a sudden everybody is worried about how im not going to the british oh man and they blasted me for it
2209491 to tell you the truth i just couldnt believe it if i hadnt been playing well the scenario would have never happened so to me it was a compliment and i enjoyed it
2209492 for the past 3 months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period
2209493 a mccain campaign aide confirms that the campaign is going back and examining the contributions bundled by our new friend harry sargeant who was the subject of that big washington post piece detailing how he stockpiled money for mccain from a host of unlikely donors
2209494 there are so many instances of republican election fraud it isnt funny
2209495 obama who has received more from the pockets of employees at several of big oils biggest and most recognizable companies tallying contributions by employees in the industry and their families we found that exxon chevron and bp have all contributed more money to obama than to mccain
2209496 the methodology of the study is worth noting it tallies up the contributions of people at three of the biggest companies and their families finding they were more generous to obama but at the same time the study notes that overall mccain has hauled in three times more money from the industry than obama has its also worth noting that the sort of contributions included in this study from low level employees at say exxon is hardly comparable to the sort of exec bundling for mccain that went on at hess
2209497 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2209498 at first glance panda internet security 2008 hardly looks different from last years model but there are some exciting additions

2209500 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2209501 a tire pressure gauge as a better energy solution than drilling for more oil in america
2209502 instead of dropping in to vacuum money from well heeled minnesotans today barack obama needs to take his first positive step towards american energy independence by calling upon nancy pelosi and harry reid to allow a vote on the republican all of the above energy plan and bring real relief to americans on the high energy prices were all facing
2209503 money for bridges and education not for war and ovulation
2209504 obamas energy efficiency policy is a better solution than drilling for more oil its been well established as fact that drilling for more oil will do nothing to lower us energy prices
2209505 for our purposes in evaluating obamas claim all the available evidence shows that hes on solid ground in saying that better car and tire maintenance would save as much gasoline as drilling would generate
2209506 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2209507 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production
2209508 exactly obama thinks his supporters dont know they should use a tire gauge
2209509 i take no real confidence in any poll or media prediction we will have to wait and see right
2209510 money for bridges and education not for war and ovulation
2209511 i know senator barkley through some other people and i figured id lend a hand

2209537 i tried too hard and sort of pushed it too much so i always made a lot of mistakes this year both the swing is better i definitely feel a lot calmer more and more sort of content with life in general i would say
2209538 the fairways are narrow and if you miss the fairways by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards which you need to take different peoples opinions as to whether that is fair it is a difficult course anyway with the greens and the pin positions to protect it im not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back toward the tee the night before the tournament i think the u s open at torrey pines was set up perfectly
2209539 beijing 2008 the official video game of the olympic games

2209544 video games pass the time so much easier than just playing cards
2209545 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2209546 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2209547 for me it keeps me off my feet it keeps me engaged and i dont waste a lot of energy playing them

2209594 with gas prices now hovering around 3 smart drivers care savvy consumers are seeking to increase fuel economy and the life of their tires by paying more attention to those rubber objects that are attached to their vehicle tires that are underinflated by 6 to 7 pounds per square inch increase tire rolling resistance 10 percent or more increase tread wear rates and tire fatigue when a tire is underinflated the tires road contact zone and cyclic stress level changes resulting in undesirable loss in tire and vehicle performance with escalating fuel prices the time is now for drivers to focus on simple things like proper tire pressure to maximize tire performance and increase fuel economy
2209595 i understand you wanted some details about the store in falluja that looks like a kfc this store is not approved by kfc international and we have working with the us military to warn the troops of this situation
2209596 whether it be the oil industry or the bush administration someones got an alterior motive
2209597 and the individual candidates apparently get bribe money on top of it
2209598 individuals who work in the industry that arent oil execs
2209599 do you conservatives seriously believe that the fossil fuel industry has contributed
2209600 i especially hope that conservative parents make their deranged views known to their children so that when the whole ball of sh t explodes in the future the kids can spit in their crappy parents faces
2209601 and yes jay you can track their position guess youve never contributed to a candidate because they ask that
2209602 not to mention that the people who track donations also can identify the names of the big oil execs
2209603 youre the typical they all do it throw all them bums out
2209604 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you
2209605 if youre going to follow one party blindly and assume theyre 100 right all the time
2209606 its the amounts and the timing in the case of large contributions and whether those large contributors get
2209607 obama voted for a 2005 energy bill that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production mccain voted against it
2209608 voted for the bill because it included huge investments in renewable energy
2209609 because that would be hillarious to see you actually post that and expect any of the readers to believe it
2209610 if you are less interested in the truth and more interested in smearing your opponent
2209611 the only conclusions i am left to draw from your post is that mccain has some measure of integrity and obama is largely a phony
2209612 its okay for a candidate to support a measure that contradicts him in one place but also contains things which he supports
2209613 voted for the bill because it included huge investments in renewable energy
2209614 i realize we havent seen much of this in politics but its called compromise
2209615 ill vote for your wasteful idea if you agree to support my wasteful idea
2209616 god i wish the election were held tomorrow so we could stop having this stupid
2209617 oh thats right you think everybody lies about who they work for rolls eyes
2209618 i dont see the donations flooding into obamas campaign after his supposed flip flop to supporting more drilling
2209619 the oil and gas industry which often sides with repubs went from giving 18 percent of its contributions to democrats overall in 2006 to 26 percent so far in 2008 that means 74 of its contributions are going to repubs right now
2209620 house republicans on tuesday said their protest of speaker nancy pelosis d calif decision not to allow a vote on expanded offshore oil drilling has helped lower gas prices heading into a third day of speeches in the near empty chamber republicans acknowledged that the average price of gas and oil has declined in recent weeks but they claimed credit for part of that reduction
2209621 the oil and gas industry which often sides with repubs went from giving 18 percent of its contributions to democrats overall in 2006 to 26 percent so far in 2008
2209622 soooo obammers in the pockets of lobbyings entertainment and telecom services right
2209623 you want to count the number of mcbushes mcsames bushco rwers etc vs the number of obominations
2209624 the republican party sometimes can be too cynical negative and needs to be more hopeful and optimistic and energetic
2209625 yeah mccain is looking out for middle america except his tax plan doesnt really reflect that at all
2209626 the republican party sometimes can be too cynical negative and needs to be more hopeful and optimistic and energetic
2209627 whats the real reason for this thats what id like to know
2209628 i think theres a difference between a realist i e bush 41 nixon and cynical and negative two very different things jay
2209629 oh i dont know maybe since your question is answered by whats covered in it
2209630 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation
2209631 you were the one that asked how mccains tax plan would benefit middle america
2209632 whoever said tpmuckraker is an established and resourced site with no reader posts
2209633 watch this guy interview william jefferson another member of the most ethical congress in history
2209634 you were the one that asked how mccains tax plan would benefit middle america
2209635 hahaha yeah mccain is looking out for middle america except his tax plan doesnt really reflect that at all
2209636 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2209637 another obama lie he said that tire inflation would save energy equal to
2209638 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s
2209639 unlike liberal democrats conservatives support all forms of energy independence including conservation including proper tire inflation wind solar hydrogen and domestic oil drilling
2209640 cnc the white house says offshore drilling is going to get an extra 200 000 bbls a day in 20 years which is something like 70 million bbls year
2209641 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
2209642 obama supports the bipartisan bill democrats and republicans dtsi in case you dont know what bipartisan means that includes some drilling
2209643 obama would need at least a 10 to 15 point lead in the polls to have a chance
2209644 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
2209645 why does it matter who im telling you we made the contribution we funneled it through the channel in florida because thats the contact we had i was responsible for collecting it
2209646 as far as current leases go id support a use it or lose it program i wonder if the politicians would though as its pure income to the fed government
2209647 for the most part im happy with the way the selection process has put this team together
2209648 i like the way its shaped up how things have played out so far i always felt like four picks are better than two because there would be two less guys i would disappoint but now as i look at it its actually becoming difficult
2209649 its still a big question mark theres a lot of time left i think common sense plays a part theres so many things you can look at its crazy
2209650 im looking for guys who are playing really well and that have a lot of confidence
2209651 that makes a big difference i think its pretty simple
2209652 im just going to accept whatever the personalities are and then try to figure out which ones i feel are right together
2209653 i think its very compelling and its going to be worth watching the next few weeks to see what happens
2209654 john mccain has visited afghanistan four times spent 22 years in the military served for years on the armed services committee and is a recognized international leader on national security policy
2209655 obama has never visited afghanistan once before this week and has no other foreign policy or national security experience to speak of it isnt even close
2209656 lets see we will print if it was a suv but we will not mention the race of a suspect its all settled
2209657 objectively speaking bush and cheney have bent rules and reinterpreted laws concerning the authority of the office of prez and vp
2209658 the first is that when it comes to his stand on iraq obama is like a man trapped in quicksand the more he fights to justify his past stances the quicker and deeper he sinks obamas explanations have moved from being misleading to unserious to embarrassing
2209659 whos better a decrepit geezer from some old war or a negro the tv boys say that negro is arrogant and uppity i dont like that too much ill go with the wrinkly old white guy but god is he ugly
2209660 they do it with cabinet members and ambassadors too why not attys
2209661 interestingly theres a report out today about obamas focus on tim kaine va governor for vp
2209662 so does barack obama have a problem with white voters
2209663 with whites expected to comprise less than 80 percent of the 2008 electorate and with a 20 1 margin among black voters and a 2 1 margin among hispanic voters obamas current nine point deficit among white voters would translate into a decisive victory in november
2209664 the current electoral vote count based on state polling is as follows
2209665 there is an increase in lawsuits all across america as people continue to try to make an easy buck police like other people in power doctors for example are easy targets
2209666 just tell me one thing barack obama has done that you admire
2209667 oh yeah mccain is what 30 years older than obama
2209668 you see no problem with a city council banning a legal business thats scary
2209669 if you wanted them to have the information youd get it to them
2209670 i changed to sharing information with them instead try it sometime you might be surprised
2209671 im happy for you that you figured out your approach was poor when dealing with your parents congratulations on that
2209672 and ive frequently just shared information if you interpret that otherwise thats your issue
2209673 agreed again congratulations most of us accomplished that as teenagers but whatever
2209674 the u s military can play a critical role in building indigenous capacity
2209675 but should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in muslim societies since its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment
2209676 well obama had an exceptional academic career being named president of harvard law review taught constitutional law at u of chicago
2209677 and i will also say this embracing of rap has only enhanced the separation from societal norms its only the rappers and the music executive who get rich the rest end up dead shot dead by some punk with his paints down around his knees and holding the gun sideways as he shoots
2209678 to not deal with the disproportionate way it hits black america is doing a disservice to the issue and a disservice to black america
2209679 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2209680 the race has been very close before with obama holding a 1 point lead as recently as july 15 17 and the race tied for several days in late june the story of the election through the summer months has been a close race that simply does not seem to want to change obama has generally been in the lead and it is significant that mccain has never held even a 1 point lead among registered voters in gallup poll daily tracking since obama clinched the democratic nomination in early june still the relative stability of the race even in the aftermath of such a high visibility event as obamas foreign trip coupled of course with the mccain campaigns vigorous efforts to defuse its impact continues to suggest that it may be the conventions in late august and early september that will offer the next potential timeframe for significant and or sustained change
2209681 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
2209682 moreover a month ago obama explicitly claimed without evidence that the republicans will attack him on racial grounds
2209683 so we have to begin a phased withdrawal have our combat troops out by march 31st of next year and initiate the kind of diplomatic surge that is necessary in these surrounding regions to make sure that everybody is carrying their weight and that is what i will do on day one as president of the united states if we have not done it in the intervening months
2209684 he will never withdraw the troops from iraq he is dying to keep troops there indefinitely and would fight actual withdrawal every step of the way regardless of what the iraqi government and our congress and people might desire
2209685 im change and if you dont like it its because i dont look like the others
2209686 frame mccain as some sort of gwb rove deciple which of course he is not
2209687 and it was just coincidence that the iraqis hit on the same timeframe as obamas
2209688 obama is like these two dirty promiscuous blond white girls that you hate
2209689 out by mar 31 statement confuse the fact that he said these things
2209690 as most thinking people acknowledge it wasnt just the surge that accomplished that
2209691 by the way les if you keep using offensive rw slurs to refer to the democratic nominee for president
2209692 by the way les if you keep using offensive rw slurs to refer to the democratic nominee for president
2209693 and just a note d2 in case you ever get tired of looking like an absolute moron
2209694 yes jay you are correct in saying the surge didnt occur in a vacuum nothing ever does
2209695 an authoritative magazine of liberal ideas committed to a just society an enriched democracy and effective liberal politics
2209696 as important as the increase in american troop strength was the employment of those soldiers and marines in joint security stations to protect the iraqi population on a full time basis
2209697 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
2209698 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
2209699 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
2209700 according to gallup poll daily tracking from july 29 31 john mccain and barack obama are now tied at 44 in the preferences of national registered voters
2209701 i write to strongly protest your decision to instruct sinclairs abc affiliates to preempt this evenings nightline program
2209702 every american has a responsibility to understand fully the terrible costs of war and the extraordinary sacrifices it requires of those brave men and women who volunteer to defend the rest of us lest we ever forget or grow insensitive to how grave a decision it is for our government to order americans into combat
2209703 there is no valid reason for sinclair to shirk its responsibility in what i assume is a very misguided attempt to prevent your viewers from completely appreciating the extraordinary sacrifices made on their behalf by americans serving in iraq war is an awful but sometimes necessary business your decision to deny your viewers an opportunity to be reminded of wars terrible costs in all their heartbreaking detail is a gross disservice to the public and to the men and women of the united states armed forces it is in short sir unpatriotic i hope it meets with the public opprobrium it most certainly deserves
2209704 it is no longer the party representing the values of jfk but of karl marx
2209705 and dtsi the gop is so far right it makes goldwater look like ted kennedy
2209706 we cant discriminate against religion the other is we cant discriminate in favor of religion
2209707 it would essentially violate the rights of male lifeguards if we only hired female lifeguards for certain duty
2209708 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2209709 played the race card from the bottom of the deck
2209710 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
2209711 al qaida confirmed in a web statement sunday the death of a senior commander known as a top explosives and poisons expert who is believed to have been killed in a u s airstrike in pakistan last week
2209712 sen john mccain of arizona called sen barack obama naive today and blasted him for advocating a bombing of al qaeda hide outs in pakistan
2209713 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
2209714 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

2209720 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way it almost would make me try too hard so i think if i just focus on what gets me to play well that will help me and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
2209721 theres a lot of golf ahead of me im just excited to be playing well
2209722 ive been very inconsistent this year and i just decided to make a change
2209723 i got a little different information and i kind of worked on it and it just clicked
2209724 today i felt like i didnt hit the ball very good but i was able to get it around the golf course if that happened maybe a month ago i probably would have shot a few over par so im happy where my game is i think its only going to get better too
2209725 i think the tough thing is to basically know youre not able to play and youre watching guys youre competing with play every week and youre kind of throbbing at the mouth a little bit
2209726 i find it pretty easy to let this course intimidate you its one of those old school challenges that just kind of never lets up but its still golf if you hit it in the right spots you should be fine

2209744 we couldnt get her on could we in relation to ms wriedt as a guest on

2209747 i cop all that we give it we cop it its fair game
2209748 how i got into trouble over caroline wilson ill never know you bring out a mannequin a good looking mannequin i thought wed put some pants and a bra on it instead of bring it out starkers and stapled her face on it
2209749 i dont know if youve ever tried to carry a mannequin but the only way you can carry it because they are designed for shop fittings the only way you can carry it is to put your hand under its crotch
2209750 she got grumpy and thought that i was physically assaulting her but she should be so lucky
2209751 everyone of these appearances could be the last time i appear in public because one day the station will say now mate this is enough weve had enough of this youve got to wind it up and that will be it thats life view rss feed
2209752 hes still not up to it and called on friday to pull out
2209753 at first the few people who stopped were wondering what i was doing helping him but i reassured them i was a doctor on australian tv anyway she said

2209760 next year is the big one for me i have two tv projects in development in hollywood at the moment and im really going after it
2209761 some of hallmarks new humour greeting cards are parodies of todays most popular celebrities and politicians these cards take a satirical look at news and gossip surrounding these public figures and we do not believe the cards violate any of these public figures rights
2209762 hes a wonderfully nutty little thing and youd think he owns the place but hes not spoilt at all
2209763 its a little bull by the sculptor barbara tribe and he looks ready and set to charge somebody
2209764 i dont know that im going to be charging and retreating but i have certainly been scraping the ground a bit
2209765 i keep working on them and putting down thoughts but somebody will have to put them all together for me
2209766 for us he probably would play more at the two guard simply because thats a less crowded spot for us
2209767 the only two guards we have are kobe bryant and sasha vujacic even though his most natural position is point guard were a little crowded there
2209768 the only photos ive seen are the ones in the paper
2209769 i think the government should be spying on all arabs engaging in torture as a televised spectator sport dropping daisy cutters wantonly throughout the middle east and sending liberals to guantanamo
2209770 we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity we werent punctilious about locating and punishing only hitler and his top officers
2209771 you liberals are the descendents of adolf hitler only you dont know it youre the most dangerous people on planet earth
2209772 im beginning to think that women should be denied the vote their hormones rage they are too emotional
2209773 i for the most part dont go to those sorts of places bad for my spiritual health you know
2209774 there are more and more influential people and organizations on the left that wish for teh death of their politacl opponents than there are on the right

2209777 if you want to criticize the man criticize his politics positions and personal actions if you can find cause to do so
2209778 you cant just rely on your speed size and talent alone
2209779 the goal of this part of the movement is to destroy marriage to make the rest of us more like them
2209780 the average american heterosexual has a total of 4 sexual partners in a lifetime including those who have multiple marriages the average homosexual has 90 sexual partners in a lifetime
2209781 there are no people or gay advocacy groups out there with the exception of a few nuts just like there are a few nuts in every movement who are advocating that
2209782 i have noticed recently that all of a sudden and that book is well over 15 years old it is being referenced by several right wing types as the authoritative agenda that we are supposedly all following that strikes me as incredibly funny since i found it not a particularly striking book and also i have a feeling most other lgbts and allies are unaware of its existence
2209783 all evidence points to choice and mental trauma in a large majority of homosexuals
2209784 an average life expectancy of 30 years less than heterosexuals we are not bigots we just want homosexuals to stop believing lies and get rescued from behavior that has been shown to kill them three times faster than alcoholism
2209785 feel free to call me a bigot all you want
2209786 save lives and prevent people from choosing to join a lifestuyle that will kill most of them by its very nature while prevnting this lethal abberation fromgaining any more social acceptance than any other self destructive behavior
2209787 this second part ties directly to the first it may not bother you that homnosexuals are frequently killed at a yougn age by their sexual behavior but it bothers me greatly
2209788 feel free to call me a bigot all you want
2209789 you can continue to support the homosexual agenda and enable people to kill themselves for belief in a vast left wing lie the choice is yours
2209790 abnormal compulsion that has a nearly 100 recovery rate among people who seek help
2209791 now that the president has given what they asked for they want to condemn him the troops and the mission with a non binding bolster enemy morale act this is what is known as giving aid and comfort to the enemy
2209792 but i am in fact not delusional nor ignorant nor do i hate america
2209793 if that is what the majority of the us thinks that invading iraq was against our national interests would you have us to go along with the minority against what we thought was the right and moral thing to do
2209794 do you believe that it was vital emphasis on vital to u s interests to invade iraq
2209795 do you think that deposing saddam hussein was a good thing
2209796 should the u s stay in iraq until victory is certain
2209797 did you see the new report showing that fatal terrorist attacks by jihadists has increased sevenfold since the iraq invasion
2209798 the problem is they view things too simplistically and they assume terrorists are rational
2209799 interesting that you keep mentioning democrats given that 17 republicans also voted for that non binding resolution
2209800 he and everyone who can be linked to this atrocity need to be done away with
2209801 it was only a matter of time before a leader in the aclu was busted on something like this
2209802 it was only a matter of time until a leader in the republican party was busted on this sort of perversion the republicans attract authoritarian do what i say sorts of monsters
2209803 it was only a matter of time until more preachers were busted on child abuse charges religion attracts the sick and ill we ought to kill them all
2209804 the republicans attract authoritarian do what i say sorts of monsters
2209805 democrats attract authoritarian do what i say sorts of monsters
2209806 religion attracts the sick and ill we ought to kill them all
2209807 the aclu supports every sick cause it has taken up in defense
2209808 if we start listing convictions in the national republican and democratic parties or places where they were forced out of office due to malfeasance criminal conduct and sexual assaults misconduct wed see a list that includes both sides but is predominantly republican
2209809 it is ridiculous to paint a whole group based upon the actions of one man you provide some evidence that there is a culture of corruption in the aclu any deeper than what is in the republican party and ill be glad to research those other groups
2209810 do you want to get in a pissing contest comparing convictions of republicans and aclu employees thatd be a contest youd lose im guessing
2209811 do you include christianity in that list you are aware that they have defended christian civil liberties as well as non christian
2209812 the aclu supports every sick cause it has taken up in defense
2209813 and again the democrats have engaged in many times the corruption than republicans have
2209814 but by all means go with your gut youre probably right despite the lack of evidence the dems are probably more corrupt we can know because um your gut right
2209815 if you don t want what you say blasted try saying something true
2209816 and you believe that making gobs of money is immoral
2209817 most supporters of the aclu are simply deceived or ignorant not criminals
2209818 i dont know if the aclu attracts degenerates because it defends them or if it defends degenerates because it is run by them
2209819 you are making the case that the aclu attracts degenerates or is run by them both are a false witness a lie if you will unless you have evidence to the contrary
2209820 we have no reason whatsoever to believe that this is anything but a problem with one person who used to be associated with the aclu
2209821 they cant be reasoned with because theyve been taught that to kill westerners is to get a free ticket to paradise how can one reason with religious zealotry
2209822 no what you are doing is wrong and not pleasing to allah
2209823 if we designate groups with which we disagree groups who do bad things as terrorists and then therefore refuse to work with them then theyre out there making their own calls
2209824 the point is to direct their actions stop the deadly actions instead of ignoring them
2209825 we could not negotiate with hostage takers for example we could choose to just bomb the building theyre in and kill em all along with any innocent hostages or bystanders
2209826 it seems to me that you see negotiation as a sign of weakness i see blind violence as a sign of weakness and negotiation as a sign of intelligence
2209827 it is to build rapport with the offender and get him to surrender without a fight or get him to drop his guard long enough to apprehend him before he can react
2209828 it is entirely possible to get the opponent even terrorists to comply with ones wishes if the correct pressure is applied
2209829 it worked with the contra terrorists it worked in s africa where those in charge were not inclined to cooperate but could be made to see why they had to
2209830 as soon as one starts dropping bombs on one house in a neighborhood in hopes of getting the bad guys in a neighborhood filled with folk who arent the bad guys you are losing the war
2209831 and history shows that the correct pressure for terrorists is lethal force
2209832 i dont see what difference in the world it makes that they were terrorists who
2209833 i say all of this not merely as an american belonging to a nation does not automatically create a compassionate heart in a man i say it first and foremost as a christian
2209834 ill have to agree with the aptly named sir anonymous
2209835 you both are demonstrating a complete lack of basic vocabulary here
2209836 you also might want to keep from using it in their presence you know behind their backs where such language belongs from someone who has so much respect for such people
2209837 i dont stand with those who contradict their own beliefs and i dont stand with you
2209838 ensure that women have abortions available to them as a lifesaving procedure
2209839 you disgust me you divider you hate filled boy grow up
2209840 do you personally know any mentally disabled people and their families
2209841 im just telling you the reality that using that word is offensive
2209842 the real reason you are behaving this way here is bnecause you hate christians first and the disabled secon
2209843 and the fact that you are chiming in on the side of our hateful dicisive and anonymous leftie is unsurprising and have come out on the side of personal attacks motivated by hatred of the religion you claim
2209844 ive not read anything by anonymous that indicated a hatred of christianity or that sounded hateful in any sense as far as that goes
2209845 he also correctly pointed out that the left that you so revile does not for the most part exist in reality
2209846 thats why i and it appears anonymous were appalled to see someone who cares for the disabled to use their condition as epithet
2209847 you know as well as anyone that calling someone a retard is a common occurence when people want to insult someones intelligence
2209848 though your decision to mock the menatlly disabled by using
2209849 patty benson doesnt just sing the blues she whispers cries and even belts out the blues her vocals ring with confidence and emotion shes sultry and bold as she spills out her lyrics on each and every song
2209850 seeking justice because the daughter of one member of the organization had been expelled for praying before class
2209851 the portrayed terrorists were specifically christians who were offended that prayer was not allowed in school this was made clear beyond all possible doubt
2209852 the vastly more worrisome aspet of this whole situation people like the two of you who actually believe this kind of false portrayal of christianity is an appropriate thing to
2209853 i don t want to hear anything about you claiming to be a christain again
2209854 despite your attempts to claim that the oklahoma city bobing and various school shootings are acts of christian terrorism there is not one that has ben done in the name of jesus
2209855 trying to claim that kids who commit crimes who come from christian families are christian terrorists is false it is ignorant and it is bigoted
2209856 on top of all of that it demonstrates that you believe the false notion that christians are somehow more of a threat than muslim terrorists which is so far beyond the realm of reality as to be simply nuts
2209857 you who actually believe this kind of false portrayal of christianity is an appropriate thing
2209858 well i read what you wrote and i read what was in the original article mostly bypassing the wnd and aclj
2209859 certainly the context was that these fictional folk considered themselves to be christians so what
2209860 well if you read what i wrote i stated specifically two times that i thought it was a poor idea for the school police officials to have identified them thusly
2209861 i am a christian saved by gods grace and committed to jesus as the lord of my life
2209862 when it comes to flying off the handle and resorting to violence no religion has a monopoly
2209863 when it comes to violent political acts committed on our soil youre trying to deny the reality that muslim terrorists account for approximately zero of the crimes committed every year
2209864 now youre just making up just because mcveigh or the branch davidians or the kkk or the ira or the phelpses or pat robertson or jeffrey daumer claim to be christians doesnt mean i endorse their opinion
2209865 i said that you believe that the portrayal of christians that was presented in this terrorism drill is appropriate
2209866 a more accurate statement would have been no set of beliefs has a monopoly
2209867 terrorism is primarily a political tactic by its very definition not a religious one it is employed by people who are politically radicalized which often accompanies religious extremism
2209868 so the beltway snipers qualify as muslim terrorists but the columbine kids dont count as christian terrorists interesting
2209869 and i pointed out that lots and lots of completely vile things have been done in this country by people who call themselves christians and claim to be standing up for christ and country
2209870 extremists are by their very nature not representative of the culture that spawned them
2209871 if you believe that its interesting that you completely ignored my statement that
2209872 he who lives by the sword dies by the sword
2209873 the oklahoma city bombing and the 1996 olympics bombing were linked to an american
2209874 yes culture interesting thing culture an amalgam of religious ethnic economic technological and political considerations
2209875 because youve never been amongst the phelpses and the mcveighs and the christian identity and the klan you assume that that culture isnt a threat somehow
2209876 when it comes right down to it the number of muslims who have gone on shooting sprees in american schools is still how many again
2209877 name it and by the way mcveigh didnt belong to any organization just him and a couple like minded people who assisted him
2209878 one of the premier supporters and perpetrators of muslim terrorism is iran
2209879 i also find it interesting the way you ingore the fact that i came out and specifically said that modern muslim terorists are doing the same thing the founder of islam mohammad did and that his followers have been doing continuously ever since
2209880 exactly the same number as practicing born again christians zero again you assume that children of christian parents are themselves christian when this is frequently not the case
2209881 i happen to have some personal experience with with one or two of the groups that you have named and quite well acquainted with their inner workings not as a member but through members whom i knew and disassociated myself from because of their blind hatred
2209882 to make christians out to be as bad as muslim terrorists
2209883 you also assume that their actions are primarily religious as opposed to political
2209884 im taking issue with your argument that theres no valid reason to be worried about rightwing extremists who call themselves christians
2209885 when it comes to people who do violence for political ends they could come from any ideology at all
2209886 arguing that the amount of christian terrorism is greater than zero is the same thing as
2209887 im beginning to suspect you have a bit of a persecution complex
2209888 i simply stated the fact these groups are not christian groups nor are they terrorist groups athough the kkk was one at one time
2209889 you completely deny the existence those who corrupt your own faith for their political ends
2209890 else can information be gathered verified examined and considered with the benefit of hindsight
2209891 history is not what you write why because no one has the absolute end on what fact is true false twisted used for agenda a student a reader any average person cannot simply read one text and say it is so all facts are known biases permiate all works including original source material
2209892 has anyone stopped to consider that these biases in the original source material are valid historical facts that indicate the depth and complexity of why something happened
2209893 for providing material support to terrorism but tossed out a more serious charge of conspiracy hamdan faces a maximum sentence of life in jail as his trial now goes into the sentencing phase the yemeni nationals trial the first before the special tribunals created by george w bush to try suspects in the war on terror was being seen as a crucial test of the controversial military commission system
2209894 the bush administration set up the special military commissions in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states only to see the u s supreme court invalidate them in 2006 the u s congress under heavy pressure from the white house restored them a few months later
2209895 he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world
2209896 that hamdan was only a driver for osama bin laden and that he had not served in any higher position in the al qaeda leadership
2209897 we will capture or kill osama bin laden some day you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
2209898 hamdan in a turban and white jilaba a long hooded robe listened to the verdict standing next to his lawyers aided by earphones in order to hear an interpreters translation hamdan covered his face with his hands and broke down crying when he learned that he had been declared guilty
2209899 confirmed yesterday that hamdan would remain in indefinite detention as an enemy combatant regardless of the verdict
2209900 amnesty international believes that the conviction under procedures that do not meet international fair trial standards compounds the injustice of hamdans more than five years unlawful detention in guant namo ai has said that the entire military commission system is fundamentally flawed and that the tribunals should be abandoned in all cases ai continues to campaign for trials of guant namo detainees to be held in ordinary civilian courts in the united states without resort to the death penalty and for the guant namo detention facility to be shut down hamdans sentencing hearing is due to begin today he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
2209901 institutions of justice at guant namo bay naval base have a jerry rigged character and despite washingtons best intention the trials staged there retain a similarly low grade quality i n pushing the case against hamdan through to a conclusion before the far more weighty and significant trials of the men accused of involvement in the september 11 atrocities u s government officials sought an edifice not a solid structure for justice on the base hamdans case did not test the far more intractable issues of circumstances of capture rules of detention abuse during interrogation and standards of evidence that would matter in far more complex trials with the government of george w bush staring at its final hours many of these issues will never now face a reckoning at guant namo or in the u s court system which can hear appeals of the military trials
2209902 the court designed by the white house and its congressional enablers to guarantee convictions of high profile detainees in guant namo bay cuba using evidence obtained by torture and secret evidence as desired has held its first trial the military commission of six senior officers whose names have not been made public found hamdan who worked as one of osama bin ladens drivers until 2001 guilty of one count of providing material support for terrorism
2209903 drivers of even the most heinous people are generally not charged with war crimes
2209904 hamdans defense was actually required to began its case in a secret session
2209905 informed by his superiors that only guilty verdicts would be tolerated he also said that he was told to bring high profile cases quickly to help republicans score a pre election public relations coup
2209906 im sooo tired i wanna go home and crash sigh
2209907 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that none may perish but have everlasting life
2209908 being left to flap in the wind like an old soiled forgotten dishrag
2209909 the decision by pakistans new ruling alliance to impeach musharraf has sparked jubilation as well as fears across the country if current opinion polls are anything to go by he has become the most unpopular leader in the countrys history his public standing suffered a setback in march 2007 when he sacked pakistans chief justice it hit rock bottom when he sacked nearly 60 judges eight months later to prevent them from overturning his re election as president
2209910 h as the ruling alliance left any room for musharraf to maneuver
2209911 adopt resolutions asking musharraf to seek a fresh vote of confidence from the parliamentary electoral college which comprises the provincial assemblies and the two houses of the national parliament there is no way musharraf can win such a vote given the composition of the present electoral college
2209912 t he government says it has called the national parliament into session next monday
2209913 is this the end of president musharrafs political career the final act in what appears to be a gripping political drama is still far away but things seem to be moving whatever the legal maneuverings resorted to by the presidents opponents it is morally and politically clear that he should step down p olitics is not about the past it is about the present and the future and by any measure musharraf is now an impediment to governance three crises afflict the state today an economic downturn an unstable transition to democracy and an explosive cocktail of militants rampaging across the country it is true that none of these will be resolved simply by the presidents resignation however it is also true that they will not be resolved if the president remains the focal point of the politicians and the publics ire everyone agrees that pakistan deserves better
2209914 was of the view that the removal of the president will create further anarchy in the country as a number of senior politicians who have no role in the current set up will use the situation to their advantage
2209915 was the only real leader and she was killed to pave the way for conspirators she had the courage to boldly face her enemies and the present ppp government is nothing without her
2209916 was optimistic that the major political parties were showing solidarity and had agreed to sit down at the same table
2209917 the political parties need to unite as the public is looking to them to resolve issues such as the political instability and rapid inflation these problems have to be addressed as they are making life miserable for the middle and lower classes
2209918 too early to assume that pakistans politicians will impeach musharraf as they have flamboyantly declared they have formed a pact to do but the figure with the strongest cards in this round is nawaz sharif head of the pakistan muslim league nawaz the former prime minister and an uncomfortable figure even by the standards of pakistans history the best aspect of the drama is that the army under its new chief is standing back although it will want a say in choosing musharrafs successor the worst is that the battle is playing out between a couple of unelected barons not on the floor of parliament and that the vacuum is prompting violence to rise and the economy to worsen

2209933 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
2209934 this specific occs linux desktop is far more profitable than microsoft preloads because it contains two free technologies the linux os and instead of ms windows and office
2209935 for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
2209936 but even there there are already some windows pcs and windows applications and linux has had better but still limited traction as a client platform
2209937 so they will either have to migrate those applications off windows at tremendous cost or pay to run them on windows further eradicating the value proposition
2209938 may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
2209939 for a green field environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is

2209961 wir wohnen im olympischen dorf auch nicht in einem zimmer

2209984 who will get the 800 000 plus dollars to do the work and who will do the work
2209985 yet the one slogan you never hear at the olympics is that with dreams come responsibilities and in the global neighborhood any citys treatment of its local problems is suddenly a matter of everyones concern so evicting roughly 3 million of the capitals residents as beijing has done while spending perhaps 200 billion on reconstructing the city more than 300 times as much as it spent on rural health care for the entire nation in 2006 raises terrible questions about what costs are legitimate in the pursuit of social and sporting acknowledgment

2209991 other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that i should cover her up or move her
2209992 but i dont want to offend anybody so i moved her i dont think you would found this response in leeds or york i dont think anyone would bat an eyelid

2209995 first of all it wasnt an error when youre trying to run back and look at where first base is and field a throw from a pitcher and beat a guy back to the base at the same time
2209996 i thought roy was going to flip it to me and he put more on it and it kind of surprised me
2209997 if the guy had advanced to second base i could understand why the guy would give an error but since there was no advancing there should be no error i would be very surprised if they didnt change it because i think theyre going back to look at it
