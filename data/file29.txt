290000 gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine
290001 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to websites or online applications including peer to peer services
290002 considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
290003 such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service
290004 comcasts throttling of legal internet traffic had nothing to do with network management as the company claims
290005 it had everything to do with a big company trying to exert its power over a captive internet market
290006 it should be noted however that bittorrent while having legitimate uses is the protocol of choice for the illegitimate trafficking of movies software and other copyrighted content
290007 it should be noted however that the internet while having legitimate uses is the mechanism of choice for pedophiles trading illegal images of our children
290008 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
290009 there are not yet measurable effects of possible further strike actions and cost burdens from the ongoing negotiations

290029 i got worried and started walking through the paddock and found more deer i went round and there was 1080 everywhere
290030 she just sat with it crying while it called out no one should have to witness that
290031 it was my fathers and my understanding that the paddocks were excluded
290032 it is a huge disappointment that we are losing the native birds and now our herd
290033 im not happy to accept this at all im not happy with how this has been handled its a severe case of mis communication
290034 the bait was shifted or wayne and his father mis communicated
290035 if its our mistake but i dont believe it is we will look after them its a sensitive issue at the moment
290036 it was an honest mistake and he tried to explain it to them my fathers quite elderly hes in no state at all to be doing a runner
290037 the trend across the middle east is for continued close family ties among the old and the young religion and widespread traditional social values make it likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future
290038 the basic social unit for the individual because it represents the source of protection food shelter income reputation and honor
290039 theyre the thickest and gooiest of liquids and the most disordered and structureless of rigid solids
290040 they sit right at this really profound sort of puzzle
290041 the deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and the glass transition
290042 this could be the next breakthrough in the coming decade
290043 body scanning machines that show images of people underneath their clothing are being installed in 10 of the nations busiest airports in one of the biggest public uses of security devices that reveal intimate body parts
290044 the transportation security administration recently started using body scans on randomly chosen airline passengers in los angeles baltimore denver albuquerque and new yorks kennedy airport
290045 airports in dallas detroit las vegas and miami will be added this month
290046 the tsa says it protects privacy by blurring passengers faces and deleting images right after viewing yet the images are detailed clearly showing a persons gender
290047 passengers scanned in baltimore said they did not know what the scanner did and were not told why they were directed into the booth
290048 passengers can decline to go through a scanner but they will face a pat down
290049 body scanners produce graphic images of travelers bodies and are an assault on their essential dignity ultimately we question whether the security value of these scanners is proportional to the cost to flyers dignity and privacy
290050 khadr put his head back in his hands and cried heavily
290051 khadr began to cry and was crying when the interrogators left
290052 im not a doctor but i think youre getting good medical care
290053 no you still have your eyes and your feet are still at the ends of your legs
290054 the videos do not show omar khadr being tortured or mistreated during the interrogations
290055 as documents released last week show guantanamo bay authorities manipulated omars environment outside the interrogation room before canadian interrogations to induce co operation within the interrogation room
290056 to pay tribute to the courage and the sacrifices of the japanese american community in the forties they had to pay a price to ensure that the civil liberties of all americans were protected we owe them so much we owe them a great debt and were all here to pay that tribute to them
290057 one of the fundamental touchstones of our democracy is that the american military isnt to be used against the american people
290058 what is the military doing with records of domestic surveillance activity
290059 its not only a matter of protecting our civil rights it also hurts public safety by eroding the muslim communitys trust in law enforcement
290060 we want to know to what extent surveillance is being conducted on law abiding citizens and who authorized it
290061 we want to make sure that the legislature is providing the checks and balances required by our constitution the ultimate goal is to ensure even during times of war fear and paranoia that our constitution is always being upheld
290062 the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world
290063 forty years ago dr king joined with the sanitation workers of memphis to insist on human dignity and economic justice
290064 the 40th anniversary of dr kings assassination ought to serve as a clarion call to faith leaders and people of good will all over the nation to join together to complete the unfinished work for which dr king courageously gave his life
290065 todays plantation capitalism is as rapacious and cruel as it was in the sanitation strike 40 years go which i chaired
290066 it is past time for this most religious country this most religious people to repudiate the economics of the plantation jesus insisted that without justice you miss the meaning of the torah and the prophets
290067 we hope that through our joint and continuous efforts with the teamsters and the ncswj we can finally bring about regulations in this industry
290068 we hope that waste management finally realizes that their employees are not just numbers but human beings and as such they pay attention to their basic needs needs such as parts tools or safety equipment that could be the difference between life and death
290069 i can honestly say it was one of the most shocking experiences of my life it really awakened me
290070 you could almost hear the sounds of the people who were there
290071 the freedoms we enjoy today came at a very heavy price by those who came before us
290072 muslims have to go to the airport two or three hours early
290073 youre stopped youre searched they take your laptop they copy your business cards
290074 its easy to say we are a nation of civil liberties when things are easy
290075 this kind of backlash that happens during times of war is something that i know is on the minds of a lot of muslims
290076 the point of this trip is to get ourselves and everyone else educated so that people understand that what happened to the japanese here during world war ii can never be allowed to happen again to muslims or anyone
290077 i made a commitment to use this experience and relate it to my khutbas sermons for the muslim community to learn from
290078 o god stand by our muslim brothers and sisters in their time of suffering
290079 they had two to three minute movies playing that i watched
290080 as we grow and educate ourselves we have to let that anger go
290081 i dont know how to put into words the frustration level how difficult this year has been
290082 i dont know why they gave me 99 i wanted to get 30 but i will stay with 99
290083 he had to find her he had to find her

290085 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things
290086 people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong
290087 not only is the cruiser which lies in the middle of a tourist paradise full of environmentally hazardous chemicals it turns out that it contains radioactive material as well
290088 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should
290089 nobody is going protect the natural world unless they understand it
290090 he was not fit to plan or execute but he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pickup trucks

290102 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
290103 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
290104 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
290105 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
290106 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
290107 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video
290108 should do the honourable thing and step down from the board
290109 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning
290110 being number one in the coaches preseason poll does have significance since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game

290130 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
290131 a lot of products get designed in a day people just throw them out there
290132 slowly but insistently reset our expectations about what a product should cost and about what its worth
290133 companies create great products when they follow their core passion they do less successful products when they chase opportunities outside of their realm for reasons like brand extension and trendy market segments they need to stay true to themselves
290134 the basic premise behind the authors paper that incident data in its raw form is signaling a serious health threat by these ingredients is fundamentally flawed
290135 there was no evaluation by expert clinical and medical toxicologists to sort out incidents that under further scrutiny by epas team of expert toxicologists and medical professionals would have been excluded from the raw data set to allow for a meaningful analysis
290136 clearly the cpi chose not to invest the time and energy necessary to conduct a thorough analysis and the result is a seriously flawed report that merely serves to spread misinformation about products that have served consumers well for decades
290137 because of their superior safety profile pyrethrins and pyrethroids have been the replacement ingredients of choice following the removal of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphates from the marketplace pyrethrins and pyrethroids have helped to provide public health benefits by controlling pests that can transmit to humans diseases such as lyme disease and west nile virus

290141 we look forward to welcoming first priority customers and soon offering them the channels choices and convenience enjoyed by existing suntrust customers

290147 it will be difficult to rally prices in corn or beans as long as the weather remains bearish
290148 by prescribing drugs to patients they had never even met much less diagnosed these two physicians facilitated the illegal sale of pharmaceuticals over the internet
290149 those who participate in or operate such schemes can expect to be prosecuted
290150 the public deserves to deal with physicians and pharmacists who honestly and professionally work to guard peoples health
290151 these convicted defendants sold that immense responsibility with which they were entrusted
290152 these individuals participated in a scheme for their own financial benefit by preying upon the vulnerabilities of patients seeking to purchase prescription medications
290153 in the interest of public health and safety the fbi is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and dismantle the operation of fraudulent internet pharmacies like affpower that victimize american consumers
290154 never has the expression buyer beware had a greater ring of truth
290155 the illegal sale of pharmaceuticals over the internet poses a serious threat to americans who mistakenly assume these substances are safe the defendants who pleaded guilty today were medical professionals who knew full well the risks inherent in what they were doing ice is committed to seeing that those who exploit the internet for profit and put the public in harms way are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
290156 the internet age has changed the way we all conduct our daily business and the medical profession is not immune unfortunately the proliferation of unlawful internet pharmacies has allowed some in trusted professions who seek to exploit perceived vulnerabilities to veil themselves with anonymity and betray their sacred oath and the public trust
290157 irs criminal investigations contribution in this case as well as in many others involves providing the financial expertise to follow the money trail and seizing the profits of illegal activities
290158 working together and utilizing the expertise offered by our partner investigative agencies makes law enforcement more effective in ending corruptive activity such as what occurred in this case
290159 tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
290160 we are interested in the nature and extent to which you engage in such practices and the impact it could have on consumer privacy
290161 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
290162 we are concerned negotiations with drug traffickers means they are given sentences that are practically indulgent they become a mockery

290164 the iraqi government calls on all parties in kirkuk to be abided by calm and wisdom to rely on law and constitution
290165 the iraqi government stresses its rejection to any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and considers it illegal and unconstitutional
290166 kirkuks final situation is controlled by constitutional mechanisms and political consensus that was agreed upon by all parties and the government has started to follow through the committee of article 140 of the iraqi constitution that clarified the roadmap of kirkuks future on bases that have been agreed upon to guarantee peaceful living and to respect the diversity in the city
290167 the iraqi government warns that any violation or security disturbance committed by any armed group will be dealt with in all firmness and force according to the law
290168 we presented today a request signed by 24 members out of the 41 members demanding to annex kirkuk to iraq kurdistan region as it is a constitutional right to be submitted to the iraqi parliament
290169 palmos is not much different than apples old system 6 netscape navigator and even internet explorer 4 and 5 ran fine on old slow powerpc 60x g1 7xx g2 and g3 based macs without much ram

290171 webkit itself has been ported by many individuals separately to several embedded platforms custom chips with arm 7 arm 9 or arm 11 cores using parts of qt3 or nanox for the gui and is included in qt4 4 palmos does have funky memory but it does overlays and webkit should run on treos fast arm7 processor
290172 otherwise hopefully you arent graduating in cs or it because your rep is nuked until someone ignores your bs and ports webkit themselves and lets you download a copy so you can finally release universe and claim you did all the work over the past

290259 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
290260 congress has intentionally refrained from imposing the heavy hand of government which is precisely why we have seen such rapid growth in the internet
290261 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet

290433 there is absolutely no reason for us to be dependent upon opec there is enough gas and oil under the soil of alaska not to mention the dakotas and the gulf of mexico to meet the energy needs of the united states for the next 150 200 years there is also no reason that gas should cost more than 1 50 a gallon which is about what it was before bush became president we must begin drilling for the domestic oil that we know exists we must build more refineries and nuclear power plants

290438 my hand is getting a little tired so can you do me a favor
290439 its a good idea because they get to know him before school starts
290440 he was ready to go he was pumped he couldnt wait to see the teachers
290441 he just went on he didnt say goodbye or nothing
290442 it just gets the ball rolling from the very beginning
290443 we can hit the ground running with what the kids have to learn
290444 we started building on his success before he knew it he recited the entire alphabet while sitting on his dads lap
290445 is really no different than the conversations id have in my classes every day
290446 if better material was used it would at least not turn into rubble like this

290462 vmware esxi confirms vmware s trajectory to keep layering on the breakthroughs said stephen dennis president of virtualappliances
290463 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
290464 it was sort of this a ha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
290465 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
290466 not only increasing their offensive capability but also their defensive capability
290467 marks the opening of a new era in our journey as a nation an era of political and economic reform and increased prosperity
290468 this guy just took a knife out and started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
290469 he must have stabbed him 50 or 60 times there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
290470 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock
290471 then he tried to drive off but the bus driver disabled the bus somehow from the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
290472 we were watching zorro the next thing i know i hear someone screaming
290473 by the time the police had arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
290474 at 1 28 am the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in custody
290475 he has a lot of friends all very upset hes gone
290476 they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
290477 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and that it is likely to be in the new year
290478 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
290479 what most surprised us in this survey was how it goes across the generations it didnt matter if you were 16 or 65 the emotional importance of lyrics was completely consistent
290480 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
290481 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
290482 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
290483 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
290484 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
290485 when i am an old woman i shall wear purple
290486 and i shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves and satin candles and say weve no money for butter
290487 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
290488 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
290489 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying
290490 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
290491 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
290492 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
290493 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
290494 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
290495 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
290496 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong
290497 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are
290498 barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer we wish the police the best of luck in finding the real perpetrator
290499 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends
290500 however we respect the decision of the court the investigation was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
290501 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
290502 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
290503 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
290504 so called child abuse scandal all child abuse is scandalous but it is the unjustified and remorseless denigration of jersey and her people that is the real scandal
290505 our reputation has been shredded we have almost been presented as being an island of paedophiles
290506 images remain with me the tree from which one care leaver saw his friend hanging michael collins a 14 year old boy hung himself at the home in the 1960s the small windows behind which they were detained for lengthy periods in solitary confinement the fields of corn which they ran across barely clothed in their escape attempts the playing field they were never allowed to go on
290507 in the year up to march 2007 160 children went missing from care institutions in the uk
290508 its not happened in 800 years so why should it happen now
290509 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
290510 others from president clintons team are in a hurry to see me dead
290511 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena
290512 holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
290513 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
290514 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
290515 mr holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
290516 by wednesday this week i couldnt stand to see my face or hear my voice
290517 i know that seeing so much of my work can be a very emotional experience
290518 but the emotions not all bad im not a victim to everything i want people to feel the highs and lows the bed was fantastic and seminal the tent was seminal but there are other kinds of work and there is a lot of hard work involved in this art the blankets for instance are all really hard work and they are not all about me this show is a chance for people to see another side of me and my work
290519 come unto me every time i feel love i think christ im going to be crucified so i close my eyes and i become the cross so beautifull sic
290520 when im having sex and being fucked and i disappear into the ether and its amazing i feel like i am being crucified and it makes me feel of jesus and how he is supposed to represent love when you really feel love for someone you go to another place and that level of ecstasy could be heaven theres nothing blasphemous about it its absolutely genuine making love and being in love are just fantastic it should happen more often
290521 and he is not an elitist though he has the education to be
290522 its the proudest moment i have had for a very long time something that happens once in a lifetime
290523 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
290524 the first reason is his name the second is he wasnt born here
290525 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
290526 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
290527 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
290528 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
290529 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
290530 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
290531 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
290532 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
290533 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
290534 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
290535 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
290536 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
290537 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
290538 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
290539 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
290540 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
290541 they could offer another 50p a share and still find themselves in the same position
290542 a huge concentration of electricity generation in the hands of one supplier over a quarter of the market in one supplier
290543 the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built
290544 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
290545 b is a base level of fame that we identified and quantified by analysing the average level of fame in the year before peak
290546 for george clooney b would be a large number but for a fabulous nobody like a new big brother contestant b is zero p is the increment of fame above the base level
290547 this formula fits the data remarkably well giving a precise numerical value to the 15 month theory if i put in t 5 corresponding to 15 months after the peak it gives f b p 1 50 1 50 which works out at f b 04p in other words up to 96 of the fame boost achieved at the peak of public attention has been frittered away
290548 putting t 0 into the equation gives an infinite fame peak not mathematically accurate perhaps but the concept of the level of fame being off the radar is apposite
290549 i can now say im the first mission to mars to touch and then taste the water
290550 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
290551 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
290552 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
290553 airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to
290554 we are not talking about grounding aircraft but the average utilisation will come down slightly
290555 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway on the other
290556 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
290557 and i have no idea how many guns are here crime is spiking all over the caribbean these homicides here with young people involved they are usually drug related
290558 guns are in the wrong hands and these people have become trigger happy
290559 and i am in favour of the death penalty crack five necks and i believe many more will get the message
290560 i was brought down here to build a police force and we are finding a lot of good officers people who are intelligent and who want to work hard
290561 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
290562 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
290563 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
290564 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
290565 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
290566 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
290567 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration it is very rare the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
290568 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
290569 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
290570 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
290571 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
290572 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
290573 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
290574 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
290575 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
290576 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society
290577 some things are hard to return to the way they were take the internet and the flow of information when you open the window and see blue sky and feel fresh air nobody wants to close it again
290578 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
290579 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
290580 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
290581 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
290582 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
290583 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
290584 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
290585 warrior not only in the etzel but in general after having fought to establish the state mother continued to fight for us doing battle against anyone who hurt us but also took care that we would not become arrogant
290586 in the end mother also accepted the idea of dividing the land after hearing about the steps i was promoting
290587 shes tough first on herself but on other people as well
290588 her friends are long standing and separate from her political life
290589 i prefer jeans to a suit sneakers to high heels markets to malls in paris i prefer the quartier latin to the champs elys es in general i dont like formality at all it is just part of what i do you know when i was young i went to the sinai and worked as a waitress
290590 sometimes there are guy issues not only in the war in all kinds of discussions
290591 i am good at persuading people in convincing the other i try to start from their point of view so its easier for me to find a common denominator
290592 you have to be worse at something than everyone else in the world
290593 a new idea that i should go to the park and photograph those women who have the most eccentric or beautiful hats
290594 everything about women fascinates me their dresses their scent the way they walk
290595 yet after all what is there more important to think about
290596 whatever the proportion of a face whether a body is too skinny or too heavy at some moment a woman possesses the power of beauty which is given to us as women often the moment is brief sometimes the moment may come and we may not even know it yet traces of it remain
290597 true the lens was not precise but maybe thats where the art is
290598 its almost as though he has discovered a language or better has heard of a language heard about some of its vocabulary its grammar and its sounds and before he can comprehend it starts using this set of unformed tools to narrate the most important event of his life
290599 as if the film was sprinkled with developer instead of immersed in it
290600 the eclipse is a natural phenomenon i know it was also said to mean bad luck for our nation in old times but i prefer to think it means the end of bad luck
290601 china has had a lot of accidents i think it is the end it should be the end we can go on better in future i hope
290602 we can make these drugs and were going to do it
290603 how many dollars have been disbursed to them and how many dollars have been committed and how many hiv infected people do they have
290604 i sat there while this kindly man held my face back on trying to breathe
290605 i believe there are many paths to the same place and that is a belief that there is a higher power a belief that we are connected as a people
290606 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
290607 all people of faith christians jews muslims animists everyone know the same god
290608 i want to make sure that you understand that this is about doing whats right and yahoo has done a lot since last shareholders meeting
290609 it feels like we have not communicated to you what weve done
290610 we think search is an important part of yahoo and we are going to invest in it
290611 there are some very important serious infrastructure and systems being built right now at yahoo that we think allows us to compete over time
290612 we think that we are the better operating company and we think were going to make it
290613 its not going to get any more pressurised than playing in the last round of the us open
290614 i have tried to carry on the confidence that i built up here into this event
290615 i hit a driver and wedge to about 12 inches at the 10th which was my first hole and then driver wedge to about eight inches on 11
290616 its not going to get any more pressurised than playing in the last round of the us open
290617 i have tried to carry on the confidence that i built up here into this event
290618 i hit a driver and wedge to about 12 inches at the 10th which was my first hole and then driver wedge to about eight inches on 11
290619 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
290620 we didnt imagine wed have a chance to share the books in such a unique and special format were delighted
290621 has an overall coherence strength and emotional depth seldom encountered in modern poetry collections
290622 its thrilling to see a huge presence of specialist presses who are offering a platform for poets with exceptional futures
290623 socially autistic dyslexic cross lateral gay quarter welsh ex con web toed comedian
290624 now i think one can write in english as an indian writer without feeling youre writing in a foreign language
290625 but for my top 10 i decided to take the cr me de la cr me the graphic novels that i most enjoyed these are graphic novels some famous some less well known that do what all great literature does in that they give you such a pleasurable experience while reading that youre simultaneously eager to uncover the ending yet also dreading it knowing that the experience will then be over
290626 i read the book so many times i love it cant wait for it to come out in the cinema
290627 yes i have read the books and nearly died when i saw the film was coming out
290628 there are crazes they suddenly fall in love with an author and are consumed by a need to have everything theyve ever produced
290629 they remember where they where physically and emotionally when they first read these books they have a strong attachment to the characters and now they want to share these books with their kids
290630 from our evaluation of the scheme last year it seems that girls are much more positive about it than the boys
290631 the boys liked it but the girls were much more likely to say they thought it was a great idea
290632 the books teach you things about life because the characters encounter problems teenagers face every day
290633 books like that do give you a way to talk to your friends about things that you might not have any experience of its knowledge but presented in a soft way
290634 i think teenagers need a more personal perspective they are completely self obsessed
290635 i wish id known at that age how nervous boys are as well as girls
290636 so i have quite enjoyed writing about blokes but thats the nearest i get to telling people how to do things
290637 i set out to write a story about first love and sexual responsibility i wanted to allow a girl to enjoy her sexuality while taking responsibility for her actions and show that it isnt always the girl who is most hurt when a relationship ends
290638 its only later that you can look back and say i was trying to encourage young people to think for themselves or i was trying to let them know they were ok they werent alone they werent weird
290639 me and my friend both like reading the gossip girl books so we talk about them
290640 loads of people at school are reading the twilight series at the moment
290641 they can help you decide what kind of person you want to be
290642 so pious so pleased with itself and so besotted with the sound of its own voice
290643 i would have been concerned if we hadnt produced a balanced list
290644 it was very clear that we had a high level of overlap and that a large number of books were straightaway going to go on the list
290645 but then weve made a point of having a lot of informal meetings and social get togethers partly underpinned by hardeeps ability to cook a good dinner
290646 the best novel i have read for a long time
290647 youre not reading for leisure or pleasure youre reading because you have to put it this way i would never do it again
290648 they say humphrey bogart could go for my twin brother and he looks like what a gangsters supposed to look like
290649 organised crime has changed beyond recognition since the days of the krays
290650 i was always careful to draw my knife down on the face never across or upwards always down so that if the knife slips you dont cut an artery after all chivving is chivving but cutting an artery is usually murder only mugs do murder
290651 they were criminals organised and disorganised but they were also good capitalists and entrepreneurs intent on obeying the laws of supply and demand
290652 the modern criminal would rather stay in the shadows a lot of them are still active so what you mainly get in published books are the krays old associates soon it will be the krays hairdresser i expect
290653 to be a criminal now you have to be the unseen man
290654 crime is on the march in britain today boldly and violently it is double what it was in 1939 and the evil grows by 10 000 cases each month
290655 within shouting distance of a spot where eros may soon stand again i have seen men pull out fistfuls of pound notes guns revolvers and tommy guns sold well over the weekend there are more guns at the moment than there is ammunition to fit them furtive clubs are springing up
290656 okay now you can take me to the prison i just wanted to be decent first
290657 well i started to feel sick about two hours into the trip that means ive been holding this down for nearly two days
290658 now i have a question for you why are you doing this arent you supposed to laugh at my projectile vomiting
290659 well miss i figure that youve held this down for two days you deserve the chance to let it all out how much alcohol did you drink anyway
290660 well my stomach is going to be cramping for awhile now gods that tasted foul i swear thats the last time i ever drink whisky bourbon and tequila all in the same night
290661 yes but if you planned to run you wouldnt tell me would you
290662 no i cant say i would i guess theyre letting the convicts out for a walk about aye
290663 technically we can keep everyone holed in there for the next ten days with nothing but whatever you have to live with in there we have to live with
290664 see if you would have puked in there wed smell it for the rest of the week if you folk have to relieve yourselves in there we have to smell it too we figure this way everyone wins you get to stretch your legs relieve your loins and no one has to live with the smell of human waste for the next few days
290665 i guess you have to put me back in now aye
290666 whats this is the knight in shining armor going to let his captive stay all the way over here arent you supposed to keep us in a group its against regulation for me to be out of the wagon before its time for us to take a walk anyway
290667 ah well youre under supervision and i dont think anyone wants you close enough to camp that they can smell the leftovers of an all night bender
290668 how long have you been doing this you dont look any older than me and im an old maid
290669 ive only been at this for about five years im twenty one years young
290670 well i think im ready to be fed and go back to my horrible existence as a lowly thief now
290671 only people whove had to eat the crap before can swallow it down without gagging like that
290672 my name is eric kale now will you tell me
290673 good morning nalah i have to ask why do the other prisoners avoid you like plague
290674 they think im a terrible terrible whore thats supposedly sleeping with half the guards here
290675 but of course thats a load of crock isnt it you big strong guards wouldnt defile yourself on me
290676 you know the idea of you in shackles is actually very tempting
290677 kale here will take you to my wife youre going to be her new girl do as she tells you alright
290678 what did you do eric every god in the sky has to be in love with you to get a spot like this this means total protection from any of the guards or the male half of the prisoners ill even get my own little room along with actual food instead of gruel
290679 the warden asked me who i thought should take place of the last girl who recently died of typhoid i told him that you were obedient quiet and able bodied
290680 youre welcome let me give you a little advice keep your head down mouth shut and dont ask her favors until youre sure she likes you youll know when she does trust me
290681 oh eric thank you dear hows the warden doing today
290682 mother this is nalah tresrin father chose her to be your new girl
290683 my name is margret but you may call me mrs maggie dear now be a doll and go with eric eric show her about you know the drill
290684 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
290685 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
290686 beijing organisers will honour the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
290687 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
290688 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed
290689 its possible to block individual locations but would be very complicated
290690 kindly desist from discussion or debate of a political nature
290691 the television station was owned and run by the milosevic family and was deliberately targeted by nato using a cruise missile because it was seen as the main purveyor of serbian state propaganda jill dando by this stage had become one of the if not the face s of the bbc
290692 the murder certainly hadnt been planned and carried out in just three days
290693 the first one you had yesterday the next one will be tony hall chief executive for bbc news and responsible for coverage of the kosovo conflict
290694 in 60 years there has not once been a claim of responsibility for an assassination carried out by east european secret services
290695 barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer we wish the police the best of luck in finding the real perpetrator
290696 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends
290697 however we respect the decision of the court the investigation was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
290698 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
290699 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
290700 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
290701 may is due to sign his when he returns from some filming at the end of august
290702 were hopeful the contract will be signed within the next few months
290703 i have never stormed off over money or contracts i am paid quite well by top gear i am pretty happy and i have never seen richard hammond storm off either
290704 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
290705 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
290706 beijing organisers will honour the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
290707 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
290708 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed
290709 its possible to block individual locations but would be very complicated
290710 the marine corps is like americas little pitbull they beat us starve us and once in a while they let us out to attack somebody
290711 it could have come from the suits or trousers in miss dandos wardrobe or from her fiance alan farthings wardrobe
290712 it could have been contaminated by people walking past on the path
290713 i would not be confident in putting any weight on the fibre
290714 it was in fact no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by george than that it had come from some other source
290715 if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial there is no certainty that they would have found barry george guilty for this reason his conviction had to be quashed
290716 he described to me that he can be aware of whats going on around him but he just cant respond
290717 i am sure mr george has inherited a gene or genes which pre dispose him to epilepsy or cognitive impairment
290718 measures of his ability to plan and organise himself and to carry out or execute various things
290719 its not good for us the fact the jury took 13 hours to acquit means they were utterly convinced he was not guilty
290720 the fact he has previous bad character will help protect the organistaion and weather the storm
290721 are they really going to say to hamish campbell were going to disembowel your investigation and see where it went wrong it probably needs an external force to reinvestigate
290722 it is just a matter of time before i am killed
290723 i dont like to let the warders out of my sight i feel there is a contract out on my head and one of the prisoners is just waiting for the right time to strike a few come up to me in the dinner queue and say watch your back mate they are after you lots of the prisoners liked jill and blamed me for murdering her
290724 lots have come up to me and said we know you didnt do it murder jill
290725 we dont know why he has placed himself on the list
290726 i would be very surprised if theres not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering he has had to endure
290727 the secretary of state decides whether compensation is payable at present there is no limit to the amount of compensation the assessor can award but when section 61 of the criminal justice act 2008 is commenced the limits will be 500 000 for less than 10 years in jail previous convictions are not taken into account when deciding eligibility but once eligibility has been confirmed the independent assessor may make a reduction in the compensation award
290728 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
290729 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
290730 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
290731 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
290732 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
290733 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration it is very rare the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
290734 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
290735 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
290736 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
290737 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
290738 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
290739 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
290740 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
290741 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
290742 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society
290743 some things are hard to return to the way they were take the internet and the flow of information when you open the window and see blue sky and feel fresh air nobody wants to close it again
290744 im very very very excited to be going in its a great opportunity a great challenge i want to support rex i miss him so much and i really really want to see him
290745 this house has a hit list and the public are hitting that hit list
290746 kat rachel and darnell will crucify anyone in the house
290747 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
290748 il fatto che fosse stata messa allasta solo una copia delle fiabe lo scorso dicembre non era stato molto gradito dai fan
290749 youll get back an answer that sounds hideously long and clearly reflects no understanding of the special reasons why this task will take less time
290750 e coli may seem like an odd choice as a guide to life if the only place youve heard about it is in news reports of food poisoning
290751 b is a base level of fame that we identified and quantified by analysing the average level of fame in the year before peak
290752 for george clooney b would be a large number but for a fabulous nobody like a new big brother contestant b is zero p is the increment of fame above the base level
290753 this formula fits the data remarkably well giving a precise numerical value to the 15 month theory if i put in t 5 corresponding to 15 months after the peak it gives f b p 1 50 1 50 which works out at f b 04p in other words up to 96 of the fame boost achieved at the peak of public attention has been frittered away
290754 putting t 0 into the equation gives an infinite fame peak not mathematically accurate perhaps but the concept of the level of fame being off the radar is apposite
290755 most dangerous rock n roll band on the f ing planet
290756 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
290757 i was kind of bad because i am looking for that kind of job especially with that going down being in debt now it hurts a lot of people especially in the construction industry
290758 on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
290759 the ministerial statement is drafted and forwarded to the cabinet with the agreement of all its members
290760 ooh darling lets rinse this basil and have a lovely gin and tonic
290761 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
290762 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
290763 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
290764 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
290765 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
290766 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
290767 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
290768 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
290769 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
290770 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
290771 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
290772 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
290773 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
290774 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
290775 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
290776 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
290777 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
290778 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
290779 where we are today is the result of a development cycle from 18 months ago
290780 18 months ago psp hardware wasnt doing quite as well in terms of sales since then its taken off weve been talking to a lot of developers and really trying to change their thinking about how psp is doing and theyve realized it from what theyve seen at retail
290781 weve told developers to think about how they create the games
290782 because the games they were creating were mostly ports and a lot of consumers were playing it at home and saying well i could play it on a screen like this or i could play it on a smaller screen we dont want to have that competition
290783 going towards the end of the year and going into 09 and beyond were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties
290784 theyre going to be a bit of a surprise theyre going to be like wow thats coming to psp
290785 the chancellor is looking at all of these options sensibly and fairly as he always does and he will come forward in due course with his proposals
290786 weve got to encourage very significant investment in our power generation system over the next 10 to 15 years
290787 we have got to have a fiscal regulatory climate that encourages all of that investment because quite simply it will go elsewhere if there is not confidence in the uk market
290788 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
290789 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
290790 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
290791 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
290792 the spouse has traditionally carried a major burden and has contributed to the success of the other halfs job
290793 i suspect being the spouse will in some way be every bit as a challenging as being high commissioner
290794 one trial of being a diplomats wife is having to make polite conversation at these terrible dinner parties i remember in syria i found myself at a table with the indian ambassador and some other people who didnt speak very good english there was a deathly silence that i thought i should fill so i started talking about markets in different countries i was gabbling away about potatoes when i suddenly noticed that the indian ambassador had fallen asleep
290795 once i started to tell the story of the pied piper of hamlin and all the people on my table thought that it was something that had happened last week and that this terrible paedophile had made off with all these children
290796 so often in foreign office marriages there is perhaps one less happy partner and one very happy partner with the less happy partner enduring living somewhere where they dont really want to live for their partners sake because they know that its exactly what he or she wants to do
290797 you have to have a very good marriage to be a diplomats wife because it can be very lonely
290798 the difficulty is that the sort of life that we lead where you are always moving around makes it very difficult for anyone to have a career as say an accountant or a lawyer we have managed to get the best of both worlds which is great
290799 we were thinking about what we would do next we would both have horrid days in our respective environments and tom said well what about doing something where we can share
290800 from that grew the idea that we could apply for our next job together because we were both at the same level we thought we could do it as a job share
290801 i think the reason our job share got so much support from the foreign office was that it ticked so many boxes
290802 i think there was a certain amount of anxiety among staff at the embassy when they heard we were going to be coming up over the horizon but very quickly feedback became very positive particularly on the management side
290803 i dont know if you work harder but if you are only working for four months you have targets for what you want to achieve within those four months and our previous boss used to say that she got an injection of energy every four months
290804 certainly other diplomats that weve met yes they have been envious particularly when they have been forced to have one of them posted to one country and another to a neighbouring country and ended up having to split the family up
290805 if one of our children wakes up in the night because of a scary dream or a nose bleed they will generally get into our bed on the side of whichever of us is on home duty
290806 the only thing i have noticed is that i get asked a lot what on earth i do for the four months when i am not at work
290807 it will take a few days for the dust to settle
290808 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of nuclear power stations
290809 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
290810 a push for more nuclear power would scupper the uk renewable energy industry and by doing so cancel out the prospect of creating hundreds of thousands of british green collar jobs
290811 accordingly the court decertifies the settlement class on the grounds that common issues do not predominate over individualized issues
290812 our commitment to nuclear power does not depend on one single deal
290813 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
290814 we are dedicated to preserving our objective to become a major player of nuclear in great britain
290815 i am disappointed we thought it was a good deal edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
290816 the future development of britains nuclear energy capability is at stake the public is reduced to bystanders witnessing the failure of the governments market led strategy for keeping the lights on
290817 he has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
290818 a persons decision to kick the habit is strongly affected by whether other people in their social network quit even people they do not know and surprisingly entire networks of smokers appear to quit virtually simultaneously
290819 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
290820 if you shoot someone you want to make sure you kill him otherwise he can sue you
290821 my ex boyfriend is stalking me were looking for some protection
290822 if you woke up this morning with more health than illness you are more blessed than the million who will not survive this week if you have not experienced the danger of battle the loneliness of imprisonment the agony of torture or the pains of starvation you are more blessed than 300 million people in the world if you have food in the refrigerator clothes on your back a roof overhead and a place to sleep you are richer than 75 of the world
290823 a rich person is not the one who has the most but needs the least
290824 when someone loves you the way they say your name is different you know your name is safe in their mouth
290825 if you want to love better you should start with a friend who you hate
290826 under certain circumstances companies can rely on their websites and blogs to meet the public disclosure requirements under fair disclosure according to new guidance unanimously approved by the us securities and exchange commission today
290827 ongoing technological advances in electronic communications have increased both the markets and investors demand for more timely company disclosure and the ability for companies to capture process and disseminate this information to market participants
290828 first check that the council knows about the empty property and then ask what they are going to do about it
290829 youll find these officers are generally overstretched so you may need to bring a bit of pressure on them to take action
290830 so called child abuse scandal all child abuse is scandalous but it is the unjustified and remorseless denigration of jersey and her people that is the real scandal
290831 our reputation has been shredded we have almost been presented as being an island of paedophiles
290832 images remain with me the tree from which one care leaver saw his friend hanging michael collins a 14 year old boy hung himself at the home in the 1960s the small windows behind which they were detained for lengthy periods in solitary confinement the fields of corn which they ran across barely clothed in their escape attempts the playing field they were never allowed to go on
290833 in the year up to march 2007 160 children went missing from care institutions in the uk
290834 its not happened in 800 years so why should it happen now
290835 at the 2007 annual meeting our members voted to double our contributions to 1 per cent of our turnover around 7 8m in the most recent year that caused us to have a new look at good causes macmillan cancer support and disability sport events are the main recipients now
290836 citizens advice bureaux are finding the lha is resulting in some very rough justice because the geographical areas over which a set of lha rates apply are now so large the differences in lha rates at the boundaries can be huge
290837 this means a tenant can find that their lha is significantly different from someone in identical circumstances living in the next street but on the other side of an lha boundary for example in westminster the lha rate for a two bed property varies by more than 150 on either side of the boundary
290838 rent levels vary significantly within any lha area so it can be very bad news to live somewhere where rents are relatively high whole communities can find themselves becoming unaffordable for tenants on hb because in setting the lha rate the rent officer has lumped them in with neighbouring lower rent areas
290839 lha rates are set to reflect the median of rents in an area using the median rent will make rates less volatile tenants can have greater certainty about the amount of support they can receive
290840 it is an honor to see employees such as jeff recruited by larger cities
290841 we are very proud to have had jeff on our team kansas city is extremely fortunate to be getting such an accomplished individual
290842 jeff is a talented and proven financial manager who has effectively dealt with capital improvements projects internal financial control measures the annual budget process and enterprise fund rate issues among other things
290843 jeff was selected after a deliberate search process and will be a great asset to city staff the city council the mayor and the community as a whole
290844 we dont want to miss it wheres our hand luggage
290845 all our luggage has been checked in weve just got our handbags
290846 she was six and a half stone frightened and angry when i called in the psychiatrists
290847 my mother was back and the lights were on we had the most meaningful conversation wed had in years about her coming out of depression and how she wasnt going back there
290848 we are getting on better than we have done for years i can see she is not away with the fairies just interpreting the present in the light of her past it has been worth the investment of time to tap into some key wellbeing themes from her life history
290849 she waltzes up the corridor to tom jones recalling the days when women threw their knickers at him she lights up like the person she is inside a glamorous divorcee with a gang of girls on a night out
290850 preferably until the tears run down her face she always expects to wear a woolly hat when going out since she believes she is cold and that winter is coming even though it is now summer indeed this inappropriate dressing was cited by professionals as evidence of her delusional state we have turned the hat into a prop for a running joke about benny the 70s soap opera simpleton from crossroads who is my mothers latest clandestine lover due to the dementia the joke is fresh every time and we now crack up merely by seeing the inappropriate woolly hat above all specal means i am no longer scared of dementia
290851 the drug left my father barely able to walk the hospital was full of shuffling ghosts one of the purposes of medication seems to be just to keep these people from going anywhere
290852 yes you can go home well phone your daughter to sort it out
290853 specal has been utterly empowering for me personally but above all it has enabled my mother to be reasonably contented
290854 we knew there were huge numbers of fanatical high school musical fans out there but whod have thought they would go to this extreme zac efron is currently one of the hottest properties in hollywood so there is no surprise people here are trying to get a piece of him
290855 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
290856 in treatment nave patients atazanavir ritonavir once daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir ritonavir twice daily with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia the results of this study support the use of once daily atazanavir ritonavir as a recommended first line treatment option with a number of patient benefits over the currently recommended ritonavir boosted twice daily lopinavir for the treatment of hiv infected antiretroviral naive patients
290857 puppy mills are a horrible place for an animal to grow up in
290858 the boxers we got were kept in a small kennel with five dogs in one kennel up off the ground with a licker water dish like a hamster bottle to drink out of and one food bowl
290859 theyre nervous theyre scared this is a completely new environment
290860 its a lot of hard work tearing the cars apart building them getting them ready to go
290861 theres certain things that theyll let you do and they wont let you do
290862 weld doors shut add a cage battery box have to move the fuel tank all tread the hood take out the windows
290863 theres too many cars out there and everything happens so fast
290864 it was like a special field trip to see an oddity in lawrence
290865 it was real small and then it kept getting bigger and bigger i didnt think it would get that big
290866 it hadnt been seen in kansas for 50 to 75 years
290867 theres going to be people who make a lot of money off this and the rest of us are going to suffer
290868 i think its one of those hypothetical questions that pops into your mind and maybe there will be reason to know the answer to it
290869 would it be more rain less rain gentler winds you just dont know but yeah there could be an effect
290870 hay pr cticas sanitarias muy malas sitios donde se defeca se toma el agua o los instrumentos para comer no reciben el aseo suficiente

290874 the address book service is enabled by default you can enable or disable any of the other services without customizing convergence
290875 warning managing services through ldap affects users access to communications suite
290876 also since convergence has no web service level control i suggest stating that explicitly as well
290877 put it this way i wouldnt want to be marcos
290878 you say things in the heat of the battle right after because its an emotional sport
290879 i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list any more and he probably never will be
290880 if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way im still mad about it but im not going to go out there and wreck him or anything im a lover not a fighter
290881 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
290882 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
290883 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
290884 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that
290885 the nice thing here is that there are some very long straights where you can drop down and pass
290886 coming through the first 15 20 guys will be easy then it will get harder the closer you come to the front
290887 this is the most difficult track that i race without a doubt its technical its very high speed the turns are very slow you get in there at 170 mph and then youre right back down to 40 mph on the turns
290888 jimmy johnson jeff gordon juan pablo montoya we didnt get along in f1 but in nascar hes a very nice guy thats the nice thing about nascar everyone seems to help out
290889 we started walking on tuesday from montpelier we got here at noon it took a little less than three days
290890 with the mud this year we may be towing every car out
290891 every variety of music you can think of jazz to hip hop to rock n roll to blue grass
290892 its a good way to go to a show and hear the music and make money all at the same time
290893 so far its great just set up my tent hope the weather holds out and we wont get too wet
290894 the entire building will be completed for half of the original estimate of cost
290895 so i said id be willing to take on the project and if you can do it my way we could probably build this for your original budget which is around 700 000 or 800 000 and that was the phase 1 weve added the phase 2 in there i contributed some money to the project im helping john raise some money and were asking the congressional delegation so we think we are going to get it done for about a million bucks
290896 theres people waiting in line at the schools to use the gymnasiums in the wintertime
290897 so we feel very confident that from november through april this place is going to be hopping
290898 one of my brides called it bridal therapy sewing is creation with a purpose it makes them feel even more special on their day
290899 women have a general vision of what they want to look like on their wedding day for years before their wedding
290900 if its an orange dress im totally down to make someone an orange dress
290901 its just a lot of fun to work with someones idea and make it a reality
290902 hey luke saw you at the robertson library today very impressive mane all around weight loss looks good too but you stopped abruptly at the second floor landing and exited why so serious
290903 so much for nefesh bnefesh propaganda the actual 3 5 year later success rate of american aliya has hit abysmal new depths of failure despite more coming there was likely a larger contingent of former americans returning to the states than arriving on aliya a situation not seen since the first intifada this seems to be a major taboo in the community and cannot be discussed less than 20 of american olim work for major israeli companies most are small professional practitioners providing services for the anglosaxon community as is generally the case for first generation non native language immigrant populations

290907 the narrative of scripture and justification by faith a still fresher reading of paul
290908 the narrative of scripture and justification by faith a fresh response to n t wright
290909 justified by faith and judged by works a biblical paradox and its significance
290910 the waiting church and its duty james 5 13 18
290911 faith hope and love pauls message to the church at thessalonica
290912 the gift of salvation its failure to address the crux of justification
290913 should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound
290914 he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised
290915 the rising phenomenon of men using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families

290917 oh look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happy land in a gumdrop house on lollipop lane
290918 i was just sitting there in the news conference listening to kenny williams
290919 all of a sudden he says im excited to introduce our new centerfielder ken griffey jr i dont quite understand it but as soon as he said the word centerfielder my hamstring popped
290920 our council today realizing that first street 13th street dixieland road and pleasant grove road are all projects in a critical state of construction that it would be inappropriate to delay the project further
290921 the sacraments are not our arrow up to god and the world theyre his arrow down his promise to us not our promise to him
290922 the trouble with christianity why its so hard to believe it
290923 justification is not a change of status but of persons
290924 language games and seeing as a fresh approach to justification by faith in paul and james
290925 go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptising them
290926 go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptising them in the name of the father
290927 i grew up in a lutheran evangelicalism which left me with a strong antithesis between law and grace
290928 whew the law is a good thing it is holy and just and good it is right and it has been fulfilled not abrogated in christ
290929 from at least calvin onwards reaching something of a climax in the romans commentary of charles cranfield exegetes in the reformed tradition found in paul a view of the jewish law which was far more positive than lutheran exegesis had assumed i am not sure that this tradition ever did full justice to second temple judaism but at least it did not start from the assumption that the law itself was basically a bad thing ripe for abolition notice how this works out in exegesis of the notorious crux at rom 10 4 is christ the abolition end completion goal or fulfilment of the law or what after all in 72 reformed theology the torah was given in the first place within a historical scheme not to enable the israelites to keep it and so earn their membership in gods people but to enable them as a people already redeemed through the exodus to demonstrate and work out the implications of their membership and vocation the at least partial convergence of sanderss reading of judaism with a reformed view of the law makes it all the more ironic that the anti np movement is today centred not least in reformed circles such as the presbyterian church of america and westminster theological seminary
290930 reuben you are my firstborn my might and the firstfruits of my strength preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power
290931 simeon and levi are brothers weapons of violence are their swords let my soul come not into their council o my glory be not joined to their company for in their anger they killed men and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen cursed be their anger for it is fierce and their wrath for it is cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
290932 rejoice because you who are x are going to be saved
290933 you will be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
290934 the vindication of imputation on fields of discourse and semantic fields
290935 one commonly hears that it is important not only to preach both law and gospel but also to preach the law first and the gospel second
290936 can you see cheney countdown w keith olbermann july 30 2008 olbywatch recap
290937 and the spirit he says in john 16 8 will convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
290938 i just ask people where do you get this information from and people are telling me the internet e mails what people say and i say do you have proof no
290939 have you seen madonna lately shes really showing her age
290940 has been testing a digital music player that could go on sale as early as september
290941 sinto me muito jovem mas aqui tudo diferente posso estar contente porque superei a m dia
290942 os protocolos continuam sendo muito bons e o sistema foi muito bem planejado o problema que n o h dinheiro para mant lo
290943 cada vez est mais dif cil lutar antes eu tinha tratamento gratuito agora preciso pagar para receber a maior parte dos rem dios e n o tenho dinheiro vou ao hospital e me dizem que n o podem me dar o que necessito e preciso me virar
290944 i ask that the news media respect both my privacy and the privacy of my family as we deal with our current circumstances
290945 i will not participate in any interviews or discussions with media my family appreciates the kindness shown to us during this period
290946 elizabeth dole after 40 years in washington shes not as effective as you might think
290947 i think kay hagan is running a great campaign and with 94 days to go shes within striking distance of elizabeth dole
290948 it must have become obvious that kay hagans liberal agenda is failing to catch on with north carolina voters so her washington handlers have hit the panic button and are trying to change the subject with a barrage of negative ads
290949 i dont want to use the phrase but its a publicity stunt to get some excitement around kay hagan
290950 its a very strategic move for the democrats to do this now hagan needs to overcome doles natural fundraising advantage
290951 dr maamor said that coincidentally mca public services and complaints department head datuk michael chong gave a press conference on the same day of the incident claiming that there was an organisation threatening and handcuffing ah longs and called for such acts to stop he questioned why chong was sympathetic towards loan sharks chong when contacted confirmed that he was referring to ppim he said that the incident was not the first
290952 someone named alias called and threatened to attack the ppim office in 20 minutes if the two men were not released then a man called ah teck who claimed to be the head of the ah longs called and threatened one of our officers saying that he would kill his family if his men were not released
290953 id sit in the priests chair go to the pulpit make believe i was preaching and giving communion
290954 to refer to god only in masculine terms empowers men but diminishes women
290955 it affects how women are treated how their children are treated we come from god also
290956 how dare you put your salvation before what makes me happy
290957 the church understands that in acting this way christ was showing his will
290958 the church does not have the authority to contravene the authority of jesus
290959 basically women can do everything in the church except perform the sacraments
290960 men and women both have dignity but we each have roles the most revered saint in catholic canon is the blessed mother mary so its kind of ludicrous to say that the church disrespects women
290961 roman catholic womenpriests believe in inclusivity men women married divorced disabled
290962 my heroes as priests are on the fringes they need to challenge the government and the vatican
290963 ive been asked to say mass in september at the catholic workers house in washington d c i will consider that
290964 i also plan to continue my peace and justice work
290965 i will celebrate the mass i will celebrate the sacraments but i intend to be out there on the streets being a voice for the voiceless
290966 sus lloros son nuestras sonrisas y terminaremos a carcajada limpia
290967 if my wife knew how many hours ive spent emperor watching it would be grounds for divorce
290968 more than any other butterfly it takes me into a different dimension it fires my imagination the way the butterfly suddenly explodes into activity after hours of sitting still and the graceful effortless way it soars high above the canopy dwindling to a dot as it climbs
290969 ive seen a purple emperor attack a heron the only time ive seen one come to grief is when it flew after a spotted flycatcher unaware that its mate was coming up from behind in an instant his imperial highness had become bird food
290970 unlike some butterflies i could mention it asks the ladys name
290971 as they fly you watch their colours flash through electric blue and shades of violet into royal blue and then jet black and back again
290972 then dewy winged iris through the golden sky flew down drawing countless wavering colours from the suns rays
290973 we do not want to stop hurricanes completely as this could cause other unintended consequences hurricanes are part of the worlds natural balance and provide a vital source of rainfall for many areas
290974 but if we can decrease the intensity of a hurricane from a level five to a level four then the amount of damage can be dramatically reduced
290975 even cooling the surface of the water by a couple of degrees will reduce the intensity of the storms and the frequency with which that they form
290976 a single hurricane can cause damages of over 1bn and that is happening with more often
290977 if there is a glimmer of hope scientifically of weakening hurricanes with minimal environmental side effects then we have to give it our best shot
290978 charcoal production is not for the faint hearted its hard dirty and smelly youll know all about that when you go home tonight
290979 mind you youve got to be a certain type to pursue this craft
290980 i even used to spot a big old boar badger it was nothing to see him lying beside the kiln for warmth he was so old he was almost pure white and he would ignore me until i used to bang about a bit because i wanted to get near the kiln
290981 get it right and youll have perfect charcoal too much and its on its way to ash
290982 we tend to burn mainly beech and hazel either coppiced wood we harvest ourselves or tree thinnings from managed woodland supplied by the west dean estate
290983 i never tire of seeing the charcoal for the first time
290984 patxi sabes que ayer corto un tronco haciendome un hacha con la cuchilla de mi gillete y palo de un chupa chups
290985 ah va las ostia macgyver eso no es nada yo con mi hilo dental y el cristal triturado de mis gafas usadas me he hecho una segueta pa cortar sequoyas
290986 while i cannot discuss any of the specifics of the criminal case or mr hendricksons former employment with the city i would like to say that i support district attorney pat mcgraths decision to prosecute this case
290987 mr mcgrath and the members of his office who were assigned to this case were tasked with a difficult job on behalf of the city i applaud their efforts
290988 when we went back and looked at the statute we had to find him guilty
290989 there is no evidence he expected her to conduct the search she conducted
290990 you have a fundamental right not to have your pants pulled down at 3 40 in the afternoon on a saturday
290991 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing combined
290992 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd gt party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we gt would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to gt ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing gt combined
290993 i do not want to involve a 3rd party company into our business model

291016 sweetie this is ms jepsen the reporter i told you about remember
291017 i think he should change his name you know because of the jew thing
291018 you guys did you hear the one about how steve guttenberg isnt that famous anymore and how he seems bland
291019 im very excited about fighting in the mfc because its really on the big stage now
291020 if you dont fight the toughest guys out there you have no idea how good you are
291021 i know a lot of guys who just pad their record by fighting guys who arent very good i just think theres no point to that the only way you learn anything is by fighting the best guys in the mfc hollett is the best guy and i want to fight him
291022 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
291023 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
291024 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
291025 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
291026 a girlfriend who was involved in a breakup is now trying to convince the world she was the initiator and not the victim
291027 this is a very global business and yahoo is very well positioned
291028 yahoo has a sad history of complicity with violating human rights by turning over information to the chinese government
291029 what we need to do is get our house in order
291030 we decided to avoid a looming proxy battle with carl and frankly we are looking forward to working with him
291031 he is a smart guy and some say a good guy despite the things that are written about him
291032 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
291033 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
291034 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
291035 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
291036 a lot of false speculation is rumbling around about our company and instead of letting other people define us we wanted to define ourselves
291037 we are re establishing our own culture and identifying our own measures for success based on operating as a single team focused on the common goals of customer first and quality period
291038 woah mckay watch where youre headed you almost bowled me over
291039 sorry i was thinking you know grand important things and all that
291040 uh huh alright well we have a meeting in an hour woolsey has finally given the go ahead on m18 p95 and were slated to go
291041 me again just here to see how things are doing you know
291042 he was gone for twelve days you know twelve whole days but hes back its amazing you know i just
291043 and keller will have you out of here in no time and both of you will be back and well all be all be fine
291044 youd tell me i was just being stupid get me to laugh and forget all this come home soon okay
291045 sure ill relax soon after i finish saving everyone again
291046 nah youll never finish we all get into too much trouble
291047 seriously rodney were in no immediate danger the city is holding together and everyone is fine youre allowed to take it easy you know
291048 there had been a lot of talk that i was going to be traded to a couple teams but i guess florida wanted me more its great to come over here on a winning team
291049 once you get traded you come over to a new team and you just got to come over and do what you do
291050 i think thats a big presence in the locker room
291051 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important
291052 i talked to him last night china time about a misunderstanding on the report
291053 its better when we have a chance to sit down and talk face to face
291054 before training camp before the season we have a lot of time i think we can be good friends
291055 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
291056 if something i said would make ron feel uncomfortable i apologize
291057 im really sorry about that because i still dont know him very well still by the time we stay together obviously i will fix it
291058 right now the rockets made a good trade for us and we got a good player
291059 the player field for this event is flat out amazing
291060 women traditionally keep the ball in play longer and are very solid off the ground
291061 so you take the serve out of the equation and you really have a leveling of the playing field
291062 when he feels like hes ready to go hell go
291063 put it this way i wouldnt want to be marcos
291064 you say things in the heat of the battle right after because its an emotional sport
291065 i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list any more and he probably never will be
291066 if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way im still mad about it but im not going to go out there and wreck him or anything im a lover not a fighter
291067 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
291068 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
291069 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
291070 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that

291074 jimmy johnson juan pablo montoya we didnt get along in f1 but in nascar hes a very nice guy thats the nice thing about nascar everyone seems to help out
291075 we cant judge montreal by the first and second years
291076 weve really got to judge this race by its fourth and fifth year because what seems to be happening is every time we do an international deal it loses its luster it starts way up because everyone is real excited then it goes down down down
291077 we tried japan and mexico so maybe the third times the charm theres really no difference between running watkins glen or montreal its just a couple of miles farther up here even though its international it doesnt feel like it
291078 i learned a lot well get the hang of it
291079 this settlement is a positive development in the company s efforts to resolve the class action lawsuit and represents a major step forward in closing this chapter of the company s history
291080 its a little later than i wanted to be back but you gotta take their schedule and do what they want
291081 the chances of getting him back on september 1st is zero
291082 as long as hes healthy well throw him out there
291083 he was a big part of our bullpen before that dreaded day in chicago
291084 i struggled a bit with being in the minor leagues
291085 mentally struggled when you have an ultimate goal of here and youre down there it draws on you
291086 i was throwing mid 90s playing in front of thousands of fans taking long bus trips its hard to throw 97 in that situation
291087 i want to see him in this setting instead of pitching down there
291088 sometimes the setting here is a bit different and i want to see if we can get him back to where he was
291089 it was really just to clean it out and make sure we could try to alleviate the swelling and the soreness
291090 this gives him a chance to really get the bulk of reps
291091 we just have to be careful now that we dont wear him out
291092 you get used to a guy whether its al or lyle
291093 its more mental or anything but its always nice to have the same guy
291094 he played quite a bit last year we need al in there but i think lyle provides a great backup he has proven he can go in there and make the calls and be a good center
291095 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
291096 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
291097 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
291098 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
291099 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
291100 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
291101 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
291102 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
291103 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
291104 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
291105 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
291106 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
291107 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football
291108 es ist schlimmer schlimmer wenn man gar nicht wei was es mit dir zu leben hei t
291109 even the worst polluters on the road today are far cleaner than most vehicles were a few decades ago
291110 in europe vehicle specifications now regularly list a models co2 emissions
291111 everybody in europe knows what their vehicles co2 emissions are
291112 they didnt believe it was anything they said dont bother
291113 women serving in the military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than be killed by enemy fire in iraq
291114 john needs to be the deliberate experienced veteran and not the grumpy old man
291115 this is not the john mccain who americans have come to love and to respect
291116 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
291117 it is possible that global warming could accelerate even more rapidly than observed to date

291120 it defies logic that someone who is a law abiding citizen 38 years old a 19 year employee of the postal service would point a gun at a police officer at officers he called friends or a department that has officers he called friends
291121 we will look at all of the facts and should the facts prove that we need to do something differently that we need to approach the situation differently you have my absolute word that we will do exactly that

291123 has the hillary problem people like him or they dont
291124 people associate his mortgage banker businessman label with his family name and money
291125 its as random of a sampling and it gets the same results as what other campaigns would get if they called on the phone
291126 we think this is as valid as any of the rest
291127 anecdotes are good for motivating the troops and keeping energy levels up
291128 but its na ve to rely on that for an accurate description of where youre at at any kind of time
291129 every poll that weve ever seen steve ward is definitely in the lower half
291130 the reality is that when you go up to somebodys door and youre there theyll say
291131 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
291132 we apologize for this unfortunate situation and hope to work with people who bought tickets to the experience thinking they were for the obama event as it developed though we had no control over the change in days the tickets to the american presidential experience were available
291133 pienso que deber a tener el respeto de dar un paso al costado y salir de la junta directiva
291134 we apologize for this unfortunate situation and hope to work with people who bought tickets to the experience thinking they were for the obama event as it developed though we had no control over the change in days the tickets to the american presidential experience were available
291135 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver
291136 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it
291137 if you were doing a whole lot of simulation you can in theory get more performance out of the cell processor than out of the two other dual thread processors on the 360 but thats a big in theory
291138 i think the blu ray strategy and some of the other things theyve done in terms how the ps3 is positioned as a home entertainment device shows that sony is placing their bet on the ps3 as a marathon runner not a sprint and microsoft was a little more focused on the short term goals
291139 it was good to have a hitout and to see that i did my best in season training time
291140 i guess it was probably about 3sec faster but i havent done one in a lzr racer suit before
291141 my training and my preparation and the times that i have been holding in sets have been better than i have been before that gives me great confidence
291142 its really exciting to be coming into taper and feel like youre starting to ease off a little bit and starting to get some more speed
291143 bohly coach michael bohl does my taper for me and we dont plan our taper towards what media concerns are
291144 we decided long back that i always do a time trial leading into taper and it so happened to be on the day that news broke but nothing like that is going to really prevent me from being able to perform
291145 the only concern that i had was that in the breaststroke i am just not being able to get quite good range but it feels great on butterfly backstroke and freestyle so its three against one
291146 i want my way and not gods and because i cant have my way i rage

291150 he martz puts a lot on you at first it can seem like a lot coach martz is demanding theres a lot going on but its a ton of fun i dont know why any quarterback wouldnt want to be in this offense
291151 im much more comfortable than the first few days thats for sure youre getting so many reps in a short period of time so im just taking all that in you just try to continue to learn from the looks you get and the reps you get out there and what you do right
291152 for me its no different im still going to try to take advantage of the reps i get out there obviously there will be a difference with three guys instead of two as far as the numbers go other than that whether youre competing against one or two guys that really doesnt change my mindset i just try to focus on what i need to do and what i need to improve on and the things i can get better at
291153 im not sure how it will continue to go im taking it day by day today is my day to rest and ill take advantage of it and be ready tomorrow

291181 the speaker wouldnt let us have the five minute speeches because she didnt want the day dominated on the floor by speeches pointing out she has not allowed a vote on a single measure to permit greater oil exploration for the past two months this is our answer to the orange revolution and our modern day boston tea party
291182 republicans are too scared to go home to face their constituents after voting against bills to force big oil companies to use it or lose it demand that the president free our oil from the government stockpile and crack down on speculators
291183 in a week where exxon mobil made the largest quarterly profits by a u s corporation republicans are staying in washington to argue that big oil deserves more taxpayer lands
291184 word spread that the speaker who was never actually here on the floor was going to shut down the house press gallery
291185 but rules are clear that the gallery cant be shut down if a member is there so a bunch of us have been taking turns were human shields keeping the press gallery going
291186 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties

291188 okay be back at 10 pm sharp if you are not home by that time your father will track you down and bring you home keep me posted if you think you might not be home at 10 pm inform me asap as well as where you are if i do not receive a text message or a phone call prior to 10 pm then that means you will be tracked
291189 okay you may go make sure you are home at 12 am it would be best if one of them gave you a ride home or they saw that you get home safely if you are not home at 12 am your father will track you and bring you home please inform me if you have a problem or if you think you might be home later than 12 am and of course where you are and who you are with
291190 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
291191 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
291192 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
291193 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
291194 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
291195 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
291196 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
291197 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
291198 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
291199 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
291200 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
291201 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
291202 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
291203 its clear iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium we the united states will work with our allies to come up with another resolution in the security council
291204 i would say the iranians sent mixed messages this week and its really hard to tell what the bottom line is
291205 and so well need to wait and see if they do respond formally
291206 you never know what the iranians are going to do
291207 the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe is about to close

291227 the art nouveau movement represented a breath of fresh air in jewelry fabrication
291228 the designs were often symbolic sensuous and ethereal featuring delicate flowers exotic animals and the female form
291229 part of this is to put the jewelry in it context
291230 we included objects that are meant to give you a sense of the sources of inspiration for these art nouveau designers and jewelers
291231 art nouveau jewelry introduced a new aesthetic and it was avant garde for its time
291232 i think they enjoyed the challenge of rendering a very ephemeral insect with a life span of only a few days in a permanent material
291233 notice the eyes are always closed with sort of a dreamy expression to the face
291234 psychoanalysis was an important force at the time so this idea of the dream state was very much present when you look at some of these female figures
291235 owning a piece of lalique jewelry was a status symbol
291236 some of these pieces were never worn a lot of the collectors were men because of the fragility of some of these pieces they were difficult to wear they were displayed they were exhibition pieces
291237 arts and crafts and art nouveau were not very dominant movements at the time

291287 las declaraciones me generan una gran preocupaci n no tenemos m s que versiones period sticas este gobierno se ha equivocado al querer relacionar el incremento salarial a una modificaci n de los impuestos porque considero que la provincia no tiene la necesidad de hacer una modificaci n de impuestos de la embergadura que est n planteando por los medios
291288 la provincia de santa fe es una provincia s lida es una provincia que no se puede comparar ni con c rdoba ni con buenos aires porque esas provincias tuvieron d ficit cr nico
291289 la provincia de santa fe est saneada d as pasados lleg a la legislatura la cuenta de inversi n 2007 donde se informa que la provincia tiene no todo de libre disponibilidad unos 1900 millones de pesos santa fe es una provincia saneada no solo en lo fiscal sino en la previsi n jur dica para las inversiones
291290 todo esto se logr con el esfuerzo de todos durante muchos a os eso se logr con el esfuerzo de todos los aportes del sector rural industrial y comercial pero tambi n con el esfuerzo de sus gobernantes en administrar esos fondos
291291 hablar de ingresos brutos es hablar de un impuesto regresivo que se fue eliminando paulatinamente en algunos rubros y puso a la provincia de santa fe en una posici n m s competitiva
291292 veo con asombro que el gobierno plantea que es un problema de todos y cuando decidi crear cuatro ministerios m s o aumentar los sueldos de la planta pol tica no lo consult y hoy ante el primer reclamo salarial pareciera que debe debatirse entre todos y es responsabilidad de todos y no es as es responsabilidad del gobierno provincial que tiene una cuesti n de sumas y restas

291305 our offseason by far was our best year as far as commitment level to our offseason program thats what you look for to me thats where it starts its not even close from year no 3 from year no 1 of the commitment level it had to happen to have a chance to be successful
291306 its football time were excited about going to camp pendleton we want to partner with them and they are excited to partner with us we are looking forward to that and going on monday we cant wait to get started i know our guys are ready to go they will be trickling in this weekend to get ready to go to camp on monday
291307 this is our healthiest team going into camp right now everyone is on go even tight end eric miclot got clearance to go and that is already a wonderful story here is a guy who has been out two years and now eric has a chance to join our football team tommie draheim will not go he did have surgery he was fighting for a starting job coming out of spring football which puts trask iosefa back into that role tommie should be out until october we think hell have a chance to play half the season
291308 thats the way the calendar fell you get 29 practices before the first game by ncaa rule if we backed it up anymore wed be starting in july the calendar fell in a funny way where we dont have as many days off this camp as we did last camp but its also there to test them we want to be sure we have a mental test for them more than a physical test the summer in the offseason has prepared them physically that had to happen to get through a camp like this in a physical way it will tax them mentally we are interested to see how they respond to that
291309 number one we wanted to partner with camp pendleton it gives us a chance to give back and we appreciate what they do on a daily basis we wanted to get in with them in terms of leadership teamwork and how they build teams we also are going to let them be as interactive as they want to with us they have football teams on their base and they have coaches and players we told them we would show them our college practices and how we do things they are interested in that theyll be in our film sessions and everything its a win win for both parties
291310 the competition will be fierce its better in some areas than others you take the offensive line position and that is a very competitive position at this point the quarterback position is still competitive even though we named ryan lindley no 1 going in its going to be very competitive we have some guys that are closer to be set on defense than on offense but we want to make it competitive at each position they still have to hold their spot
291311 i always look at where we are picked right now and use it as motivation you want to get to the point where you are picked high and then you have a different motivation you have to fight in this case its an easy motivation for us this is where they picked us we need to prove a lot of people wrong so i will play that up again last year we were picked to finish eight and finished sixth so we moved up thats our plan our whole plan is to get to a bowl game i havent backed down from that we would like to get into the upper echelon of the conference looking at last year five teams went to bowl games in our conference we also believe that more and more we will have five games to go to instead of four if you get into the top five top four for sure you have a chance and thats a goal
291312 i like the way they are competing right now i am really excited going into this camp how this offseason has unfolded and from year no 1 to now how much different it is in terms of commitment level and work ethic thats what i am most excited about working with these guys going into camp on monday
291313 you go to training camp with the idea of working hard work on your mind thats what its all about its coming in and getting to work with your teammates and getting ready for a long season thats what you need definitely
291314 i dont know if its pressure i can definitely feel that my college career is coming to an end its amazing how fast it goes and i can feel that urgency to go out and get some wins with it being the last shot last go around i dont know if its any pressure really but it is exciting to go into your last year knowing that youre ready to give it everything youve got and see what happens
291315 its going to be exciting its going to be cool being around the military and being up on that base theyre the best team in the world so its going to be fun to see how they build a team and see their leadership tactics on a daily basis
291316 the main thing is that were closer as a team as a unit weve worked very hard to come together these past few years since coach long has been here thats something weve really put a lot of focus on and i think that will carry us a long way along with having returning experience defensively which will keep us in games but i definitely think that were tight as a unit and thats going help us when we hit adversity you know you can count on the guy the next to you because weve learned to count on each other all along
291317 itll be a good little change of pace to go up there and start fresh and start the season different with something that weve never done before so i think itll help out the team ryan lindley
291318 its been good ryans been working hard all summer long weve had a lot of good team and player practices out there and ryans done a great job of leading the team and doing the things he needs to do as a quarterback i think all the guys on our team have all the confidence in the world in ryan and what hes capable of doing
291319 being in coach longs system now for three years really helps and the guys are young the veterans had the game experience the past couple of years but they were still in a brand new system some of the younger guys havent played yet but theyve known the system now for the past two or three years since theyve been here also i think the commitment and participation we had this summer has been better than it has in the past and i think thatll make a difference too so i have confidence in the whole squad
291320 it is different guys who you wouldnt even expect or names that arent always out there in the media are becoming leaders guys all over the team in the locker room in the weight room outside of football in the classroom are helping out and ive never seen that since ive been here weve always had stand out players with guys like kevin oconnell they were great leaders but i feel like on this years team we have a lot of little guys here and there everyones doing their part as a leader it is a different feel it is something good and i feel confident about it
291321 its really good for us to bond together and you really get into a rhythm when you practice that many days in a row with no time off we have five guys on the offensive line and we all have to be on the same page so that really helps out
291322 we have five offensive line spots that are pretty much wide open right now we have some guys showing up stronger than others but i said in the spring that we had to have a big summer and i think we really accomplished that weve had pretty much full participation on the offensive line the younger guys really grew up a lot and im excited to see what happens in camp
291323 we tried to up the participation level this summer and get full attendance i think we did a very good job coach jon francis said we had about 99 percent participation if you get guys to show up theyll do the work thats what we strived for and we did it we did a lot of work now we just need to get it done
291324 i feel real comfortable i try to get extra reps all the time with guys like darren mougey and vincent brown i think that creates a kind of bond there and makes it more cohesive where you just know where they are going to be at times it feels good now and im excited to keep getting reps in practice
291325 thats kind of my personality if im not in that leadership role i feel im kind of hurting the team there are so many guys that are leaders on this team when you are a leader it kind of builds you up to that next level everyone sees you are doing extra work and they are going to do the same to get to your level everybody stepped up this summer and that work ethic is going to show on the field
291326 ive been reading some books on leadership and the biggest thing is if you can get all 11 guys on the field going towards a common goal youre going to do big things we have bonded and will continue to bond throughout camp with the same goal
291327 age is just a number the guys came in the weight room and worked their tails off thats all that counts
291328 when i first got here especially in the summer you didnt see a lot of guys this summer weve been around each every day working out at 6 a m doing 7 on 7 right after and sometimes working out again later in the day now i feel like we are a family before we were just teammates we all have faith and confidence in each other
291329 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
291330 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
291331 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
291332 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
291333 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
291334 everybody is dating everyone and sleeping with everyone and theres lots of scandalous stuff happening in the upper east side
291335 gossipy sex objects which does all females a disservice the show teaches teenage girls that sexiness is more important than character or intelligence
291336 gossip girl glamorizes and normalizes the kinds of behaviour that may seem charmingly risque and sophisticated when little girls see them on tv but which if emulated in real life can result in emotional and psychological distress for them
291337 in response to several requests for supplemental eis to deal with the congestion management orders for jfk laguardia and newark the faa prepared the
291338 to consider whether these orders limiting scheduled operations and the new rates and charges amendments either affected the purpose and need for the airspace redesign project or altered the reported environmental impacts
291339 significant new information warranting preparation of a new or supplemental eis for the airspace redesign project
291340 wheres our obama why cant we have someone with charisma and intelligence
291341 the americans have all the luck they had jfk and now they have the second coming
291342 why do we have to put up with this man full of pancake make up with his endless illegal enrichment illegal financing of political parties tax fraud false accounting bribing financial police and the judiciary why cant we elect someone like obama someone who has moral rectitude someone who can shake up our rotten political foundations and ensure our culinary heritage
291343 please god hurry up and parachute an obama into the political arena before its too late

291408 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
291409 this is clearly the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme that was correctly rejected four times by the supreme court with as little as five work weeks left in this congress there are more important issues than helping the lame duck president cook up an indefensible plan to lock people up forever and throw away the key with no due process rights and limited judicial review
291410 the attorney generals proposal would hide the torture and abuse conducted since 9 11
291411 this is one more effort to cover up the illegal activities authorized by the president and his administration attorney general mukasey might be ok with helping in a cover up but there is no reason to think that congress will assist him
291412 congress wont fall for this latest bush administration plan to cover up its wrongdoing at the same time that the house judiciary committee is investigating whether high level bush white house officials may have committed crimes of torture and abuse mukasey has the arrogance to ask congress to give him the power to detain people without trial and hide torture and abuse from the courts
291413 he wants a new declaration of a worldwide armed conflict in order to hold people without trial and then under the guise of protecting sources and methods from judges who have decades of experience trying dangerous international terrorists mukasey asks congress essentially to bury the evidence
291414 there is simply no need to invent yet another set of legal rules to govern the detention and trial of prisoners held on national security grounds and the rules that the attorney general is proposing are fundamentally inconsistent with the constitution the prisoners at guantanamo some of whom have been held without charges for more than six years should be allowed a meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention in court the handful of prisoners that have actually been charged with crimes should be tried under rules that conform to the constitution and that the rest of the world will recognize as fair
291415 he mukasey wants a new declaration of a worldwide armed conflict

291525 i consider the lack of enthusiasm in seeking comments to be minor compared to the total lack of commitment to actually doing anything useful to mitigate climate change

291535 kami sadar sejak musim kampanye banyak pihak yang kerap menyudutkan pks dan tokohnya beberapa waktu lalu ada sebuah selebaran yang isinya menjelekan kami tetapi sudah kami sebarkan juga selebaran yang isinya pks menjawab fitnah
291536 pokoknya kalau ada selebaran sms atau spanduk yang isinya menyudutkan seseorang lalu mengatasnamakan pks itu tidak benar itu hanya ulah pihak yang ingin mengadu domba
291537 kami menyayangkan kejadian ini sewaktu pemilihan gubernur lalu kantor pks di kabupaten bandung juga sempat dilempar bom molotov olah orang tak dikenal dan kejadian serupa kembali terulang

291540 kami menyayangkan kejadian ini sewaktu pemilihan gubernur lalu kantor pks di kabupaten bandung juga sempat dilempar bom molotov olah orang tak dikenal dan kejadian serupa kembali terulang
291541 kita tidak akan bentuk tim investigasi biar kepolisian yang mengungkap siapa pelempar molotov itu
291542 karena kasus ini sudah mengarah tindak pidana maka panwas menyerahkannya ke polisi untuk mengusutnya
291543 kami menyesalkan tindakan oknum tak bertanggung jawab ini apalagi kejadiannya bertepatan dengan masa pilwalkot bandung

291549 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
291550 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
291551 congress has intentionally refrained from imposing the heavy hand of government which is precisely why we have seen such rapid growth in the internet
291552 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
291553 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
291554 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
291555 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans
291556 it is extraordinary that a whole nation be targeted for the promotion of a code of conduct
291557 it sheds light on the importance that other nations place on good manners and civility here we have a developing nation that wants to put its best face forward in an international arena in order to be accepted as a full partner in the world
291558 we just couldnt get anyone to come when the kids animals are ready
291559 it cost us last year 10 thousand dollars to put on the fair and our gross income from them was three thousand dollars
291560 our campground for camping motor homes and that generates roughly 60 65 thousand dollars a year the other big thing is that haunted hayride in the fall last year that brought in a gross i think of 24 thousand dollars
291561 monday is the lamb show sheep show tuesdays the goat show wednesday is the livestock show thursday is our auction friday is our master stockman thats where the kids get to participate to be the best person all around in livestock
291562 for three weeks i could not stand up or walk i was also feeling delirious i really did not know what was happening to me but my family told me that many other villagers were having the same problems
291563 in fact the state health authority only had one blood sample early this week from a 60 year old villager when he was admitted to the slim river hospital for joint pains fever and difficulties in walking
291564 the state health department is expected to know the result of the blood sample next week before it can officially announce if there is a chikungunya outbreak in the state
291565 the driver is believed to have lost control of the vehicle which then crashed into a multi purpose vehicle and a motorcycle
291566 the lorry breached the divider and slammed into three cars and a van
291567 the impact caused my car to spin and that had probably saved my life
291568 when he arrived at my cabin he turned on the television to watch some cartoons
291569 it is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower
291570 i am afraid of what will happen next as this was the second incident in less than a week
291571 i was first intrigued with the culture while shooting my music video from yesterday in china last year
291572 they are very creative and dedicated to their arts and culture
291573 i heard that she is talented and smart i cant wait to meet her and see how we click
291574 we recommend that employers give a one hour break for nursing mothers it is up to the mothers to decide on the frequency
291575 this is among the lowest in the region and i am very worried about this
291576 the marketing of baby food and other related products is one of the main competitor in practising breastfeeding social and environmental pressures will encourage mothers to replace breast milk with formula
291577 the council should investigate this issue it should also compensate ghazali for his losses and apologise to him
291578 they have also agreed to give me a licence to make my stall legal
291579 what money for what what has it spent on that it wants compensation for
291580 the government also gives an assurance that the retail price of petrol will not exceed rm2 70 a litre this year
291581 three cabinet ministers spoke to the media about this before i could say anything how could it be a gimmick
291582 god willing world prices will continue to go down and naturally our prices will also be reduced
291583 if the downward trend continues it is only right for it to be reflected in domestic prices
291584 both of us took the opportunity to exchange ideas to encourage meetings and interactions between young people of both countries
291585 if he is thinking that by so doing contesting in the by election the police would stop investigating then this is not right we must remember that the complainant mohd saiful bukhari azlan has lodged a report and what he is looking for is justice
291586 we must not forget him the police will continue their investigations based on the rule of law we must carry out our responsibility so that mohd saifuls claims are brought to court for a decision to be made in the name of justice
291587 in this country everyone is entitled to justice based on the rule of law
291588 we all know about this case and the ongoing investigations but it is up to the chambers to determine whether there is a case or not
291589 but the due process of the law will still have to take its course if anwar is qualified to contest so be it no problem at all
291590 we will not stop him as it is never our intention to stop him from contesting
291591 we should not mix these two together because they are two different processes it has never happened before for the due process of the law to be stopped just because someone is going to contest we must continue to uphold the sanctity of the law
291592 he seemed to be in a hurry in search of a place to contest i already heard lots of things if he is to contest in other areas other pkr mps may not want to give way i dont want to speculate but permatang pauh seems easy for him
291593 they gave her their votes on the belief that she would help them but she abandoned them this makes them unhappy and there are those who described it as very irresponsible
291594 we will not allow him to win that easily without a contest there must be a bn candidate fielded there
291595 in previous meetings we never talked about this but only on religious matters and other issues relating to islam and the malays
291596 why now when her husband is being investigated for sodomy the way i see it it is a very desperate act
291597 he is making use of the people to achieve his political agenda and is not bothered if the people or the country is in disarray
291598 we will fight despite the parliamentary seat being a parti keadilan rakyat strong hold the past three terms
291599 we are not worried who will be chosen be it a local or outsider or even if the candidate is ezam we give our full backing and will work hard for the campaign
291600 we are in the process of setting up the machinery we realise that it will not be easy since anwar has chosen a safe seat instead of places like kulim bandar baru or bandar tun razak
291601 this will be an important by election for both anwar and the barisan nasional
291602 we also received a letter from the dewan rakyat speaker by fax at noon and by hand at 2 30pm informing us on the permatang pauh seat being vacant now following the resignation
291603 we do not know what the outcome will be in a by election obviously he has made his calculation by standing in his previous constituency which he feels gives him the best chance for a win
291604 we have to see we leave it to the permatang pauh people to decide
291605 china at her back and pakistan lurking on the sidelines
291606 if you look across europe other major leagues are dominated by one two or three teams so its too easy to say this is a premier league issue
291607 other teams in england should be knocking on our door teams like tottenham newcastle aston villa everton its more about them getting their houses in order rather us coming down to their level
291608 fight very seriously to restrict entry to its competitions from clubs that are in debt
291609 the book comprises 24 essays split into 4 sections which each deal with a particular aspect of brain function such as deficits and excesses in the first two sections with particular emphasis on the right hemisphere of the brain while the third and fourth describe phenomenological manifestations with reference to spontaneous reminiscences altered perceptions and extraordinary qualities of mind found in

291613 im excited about the republican party not john mccain but hes better than a democrat
291614 a lot of my friends see him as the lesser of two evils
291615 i think he could be more to the right but if you work on both sides its probably best to get things done hes a good american
291616 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
291617 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
291618 europe is marching on without us it has been seven weeks since we rejected lisbon and any well informed and impartial observer can now only conclude that there will be no renegotiation of the lisbon treaty it took seven years and the collective efforts of 27 countries to produce the text of the treaty italy has ratified the lisbon treaty and in a very short time all 27 countries with the exception of one will be in the same position the other 26 have no intention of entering into another round of protracted negotiations the irish people were sold a pup by sinn fein the repeated claims made by sinn fein representatives during the campaign that a no vote would force a renegotiation were completely disingenuous and utterly baseless
291619 sinn fein were shameless in using the lisbon campaign as a vehicle to enhance their electoral prospects perhaps people should have become wary when they began talking about protecting irelands corporate tax regime this from a party who only a few months earlier were suggesting that we needed to raise corporation tax
291620 we the irish people would be well advised to steadfastly refuse any guidance from sinn fein on this or any other matter of national importance

291634 as we said yesterday we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
291635 what has mr miliband ever achieved apart from furthering his own career if david miliband was placed back on the backbenches then i think he would become the nonentity that he was before his accelerated promotion
291636 duplicitous it says one thing but it means another which is pretty contemptible politics
291637 i think the worst thing at the moment would be if we all went mute i think its right that we say that sure weve taken some hits but actually weve got ideas about the future of the country we do want to engage with people were not all standing at the side of the ring saying go on gordon you do it on your own were saying were there with you were going to get in there and make sure that this really is a team effort because we have to take collective responsibility for this
291638 he was on it by himself and he made a right turn and hit his head
291639 his wife was the only witness that actually saw what happened
291640 this was a year long investigation which accrued a huge amount of evidence the jury deliberated for less than eight hours can they really say they gave due consideration to all the facts
291641 mr george feels overwhelmed by the verdict as throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and he continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
291642 i have spent hours and hours with barry george i would seriously doubt that someone with his level of problems could carry out the murder and i would expect someone who has his problems to let something slip but he never has
291643 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
291644 when we started this campaign we were hoping for a more elevated debate i mean imagine at a time when we face more challenges than at any time in our lifetime these guys are running ads with paris and britney
291645 its a sign that they dont have anything to offer to the american people so theyre just going to try to call folks names like you did in 5th grade
291646 you remember that back in 5th grade you know peopled be calling each other names and getting into these petty fights we dont have time for that
291647 18 months ago when i announced nobody gave us a shot we didnt have the establishment in washington behind us we didnt have all the big lobbyists and pacs and money behind us
291648 but what we had that they didnt understand was the people the spirit of ordinary americans who wanted to bring about change thats always been our secret weapon thats always been the magic ingredient in this campaign you
291649 through victories and defeats you guys have stuck with us and youve been there and youve made phone calls and youve talked to friends and youve had to defend you know my positions and explain to people you know those emails are wrong
291650 theres just stuff youve had to do because you understand whats at stake
291651 not only is he one of the best senators we have nicest man you ever want to meet but the guy was an astronaut that is cool
291652 to end up this way after months of negotiations is just unbelievable
291653 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
291654 it is the function of art to renew our perception what we are familiar with we cease to see the writer shakes up the familiar scene and as if by magic we see a new meaning in it
291655 do you want another roll grax do you want a hot cross bun grax a cup of tea ive made shepherds pie because i wasnt sure if youd be hungry or not are you sure you dont want another roll grax
291656 would you like a shag do you want to give me a hand job how about if i go down on you i bought a twelve pack of condoms and a bottle of lube because i wasnt sure if you want to try anal are you sure you dont want a shag
291657 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does said singh who was at 7 under 133
291658 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
291659 its anybodys ballgame said hunter mahan who had a 66 and was at 3 under 137
291660 the player field for this event is flat out amazing bellamy said
291661 bush and husband of entertainer gwen stafani actor model boris kodjoe and actress model sara foster haas girlfriend
291662 women traditionally keep the ball in play longer and are very solid off the ground bellamy said
291663 so you take the serve out of the equation and you really have a leveling of the playing field
291664 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
291665 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
291666 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
291667 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
291668 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
291669 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
291670 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
291671 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
291672 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
291673 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
291674 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
291675 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
291676 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football
291677 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
291678 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
291679 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
291680 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
291681 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
291682 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
291683 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
291684 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
291685 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
291686 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
291687 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
291688 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
291689 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
291690 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
291691 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
291692 the information linking the isi to the bombing of the indian embassy was described in interviews by several american officials with knowledge of the intelligence some of the officials expressed anger that elements of pakistans government seemed to be directly aiding violence in afghanistan that had included attacks on american troops some american officials have begun to suggest that pakistan is no longer a fully reliable american partner and to advocate some unilateral american action against militants based in the tribal areas the isi has long maintained ties to militant groups in the tribal areas in part to court allies it can use to contain afghanistans power in recent years pakistans government has also been concerned about indias growing influence inside afghanistan including new delhis close ties to the government of the afghan president
291693 we will look for practical ways to minimise the hardships
291694 it is a banned organisation and india will not slacken its vigil in this regard
291695 i dont like the way smoke gets in my hair and my clothes and i worry about the health risk
291696 almost certainly within five years virtually all college campuses will be smoke free
291697 whatever exposure to poisons and particulates might occur from such contact is dwarfed by the exposures to whatever pollutants waft over the campus from any of the schools parking lots or nearby roads

291699 the structure of the race has been remarkably stable all summer
291700 in gallups national daily tracking poll for june and july obama has averaged a three percentage point lead over john mccain
291701 and he has a threshold to cross in order to close the sale he is ahead we know that a number of voters are not sure yet whether they want to vote for him they do not necessarily want to vote against him in fact voters want to elect a democrat they are just not sure they want barack obama
291702 senator obama says he is going to change washington but his solution is to simply make government bigger and raise your taxes to pay for it
291703 we have been doing that for years my friends and it has not worked
291704 the question of whether obama is a suitable commander in chief is one which i think voters will continue to mull over the course of the campaign
291705 he is clearly at a disadvantage to john mccain on this dimension at the moment
291706 they know their republican ideas are used up he said
291707 that is why they are spending all their time talking about me and that is why they are spending all their time trying to convince you that i am a risky choice but the real risk is doing the same thing
291708 he met with leaders they said nice things about him he drew a huge crowd in berlin but he may have been making friends in berlin germany but he may not be doing as well in berlin new hampshire
291709 and i believe fundamentally that in 1980 the election was all about ronald reagan
291710 people did not want another four years of jimmy carter but they were not clear or comfortable for much of the way with whether reagan got over the bar of acceptability to be commander in chief and president of the united states
291711 the last time we had an open contest in 2000 around 60 percent of those surveyed by the university of michigan said that they made up their minds at during the convention or after it
291712 of the candidates supporters one quarter still say that they could change their minds so stay tuned
291713 it is hard to overstate the debt that we owe to men and women of genius

291797 es una noticia muy grata poder comunicar que pudimos bajar el efecto del ajuste por combustible esto es un alivio al bolsillo del todo el mundo y valida lo que hemos dicho anteriormente que es la alta dependencia de petr leo lo que nos impacta
291798 la demanda ha bajado porque el efecto del incremento de petr leo ha hecho que la gente consuma menos gasolina y menos kilovatio hora y si la demanda baja los precios bajan

291810 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
291811 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
291812 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
291813 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up

291833 he was not at all ringing up saying dont do this or do that but gordon and i have worked together for 25 years so we kind of understand each other
291834 but being serious actually its not that funny for us
291835 we played very bad but dont forget against who we played we played against the best team in the world against the best players against the best coach
291836 we beat the states so what we came here not to beat the states or any other team we just came here to fight for the medal
291837 he had some good games against the u s a and was real brash about it trash talked things of that nature
291838 this is what i do they u s coaches reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him

291847 the tire wasnt putting rubber down it was turning to dust and not laying on the race track and not merging with the asphalt
291848 we need to find out why the tire rubber would not lay into the track
291849 no one knew we had a problem until the end of the first practice
291850 to be perfectly honest with you i find it fun when things are challenging
291851 the challenge was how to manage the tires that we have

291940 we will have to find a space in the universe where these characters live and shape our behavior to such an extent that we choose them as role models for our life and for the life of others so that we are clear about what we mean when we say that someone has an oedipus complex or a gargantuan appetite that someone behaves quixotically is as jealous as othello doubts like hamlet is an incurable don juan or is a scrooge and in literature this happens not only with characters but also with situations and objects why do the women who come and go talking of michaelangelo montales sharp shards of bottles stuck in the wall in the dazzling sun gozzanos good things of bad taste eliots fear that is shown us in a handful of dust leopardis hedge petrarchs clear cool waters dantes bestial meal become obsessive metaphors ready to tell us over and over again who we are what we want where we are going or what we are not and what we dont want
291941 this is what all the great narratives tell us even if they replace god with notions of fate or the inexorable laws of life

291976 its quite possible well hit that goal just about a week ago we had less than 640 inmates
291977 thats always something thats there depending on what the needs are
291978 if it looks like its going to be a long term issue and the need arises then i think the need to convert some of that shell space will come a lot quicker its always in the back of everybodys mind that this going to be something that were going to have to do some day

292008 make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
292009 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism
292010 the use of the military in opposing drug smuggling and illegal immigration was a significant step away from the acts central tenet that there was no proper role for the military in the direct enforcement of the laws

292016 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
292017 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
292018 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
292019 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
292020 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
292021 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
292022 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
292023 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
292024 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
292025 we believe the terms of this agreement will provide strong protection to our brand worldwide
292026 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
292027 my intentions have been to play and with green bay
292028 they said no so i still want to play in this division for obvious reasons which i made clear to management if they wont let me play in green bay let me play against you thats where i am

292030 but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter
292031 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
292032 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
292033 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
292034 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
292035 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
292036 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
292037 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
292038 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
292039 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
292040 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
292041 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
292042 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
292043 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
292044 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
292045 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
292046 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
292047 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
292048 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
292049 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
292050 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
292051 it was pretty much the same with the last record
292052 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
292053 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
292054 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
292055 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
292056 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
292057 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
292058 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
292059 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
292060 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
292061 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
292062 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
292063 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
292064 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
292065 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
292066 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
292067 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
292068 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
292069 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
292070 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
292071 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
292072 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
292073 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
292074 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

292094 we suspect that the council have not set out to contravene or reverse their own equal employment policies and that this problem results from someone in the council acting in a thoughtless way
292095 we just hope that common sense prevails and the council resolves the matter itself without submitting themselves needlessly to legal action which would bring more unwelcome publicity
292096 we are currently implementing new internet monitoring software to make the control of internet access easier to manage
292097 patience is one of the characteristics of monastic life but even the patience of the brothers was tested by our slow internet
292098 broadband access has made a huge difference to our internet usage
292099 we knew we needed a faster connection but we had almost given up trying to find a workable solution which would give us an internet connection at speeds enjoyed by others on the mainland

292105 the public doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their cell phones on an already over packed airplane
292106 however with internet access just around the corner on u s flights it wont be long before the ban on voice communications on in flight planes is lifted our bill the hang up act would ensure that financially strapped airlines dont drive us towards this noisome disruption in search of further revenue
292107 cell phone users should not be able to disrupt the comfort of an entire airplane cabin especially when other passengers have no choice but to sit there and listen
292108 this bill will ensure a relative amount of peace for the american public as they take to an increasingly crowded sky
292109 where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
292110 realising i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight where little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both caps
292111 the impact that energy consumption has on climate change and the species and habitats that we look at supporting is quite a big deal for us and so is reducing power usage of our server operation
292112 we would not even dream of getting into the support requirements of running a 24 7 website infrastructure internally so we had to find a partner to take that support role the benefits apart from less power consumption are cost effectiveness and resilience due to the fact that systems run on a virtualised environment
292113 in the second quarter the company focused on the work at hand and improved productivity stepped up cost reduction activities and enhanced margin performance
292114 we continue to see strong customer momentum in key growth areas of our business
292115 even though it decision makers clearly recognise the importance of green it solutions such as virtualisation and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organisation
292116 if going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable it to an organisation then widespread adoption may take some time
292117 letrex holdings was wound up under the provisions of the insolvency act 1986 this was the only course of action we could take given the debtors unwillingness to settle its liabilities and unwarranted strenuous efforts to deny liability under the contract
292118 the hearing took place without us even being there so we have asked for another date when we can attend in person and defend our case
292119 recessions can be a good thing because legislation has made it almost impossible to sack staff and now there is an opportunity for people to get rid of dead wood
292120 we are hiring based on our visibility of where the market is going the niche we sit in is buoyant and is not reflecting a downturn
292121 our headcount is going to go up this year i believe it is a good time to recruit
292122 the figures are worse when you consider that in many cases it was too early to judge whether the it installation was a success or failure
292123 we need to stay one step ahead to beat the spammers and increasingly sophisticated botnet threats
292124 as businesses communicate by email we need to reclaim control of it before we can make commerce efficient and compliant

292139 but and you have heard me sermonize on this subject time and time again juan pierre whether it was on his own or on orders from the bench did the diamondbacks a huge favor when he sacrificed the runners into scoring position he put them one out closer to getting out of the jam and he might have even put bowa in a position where he felt he had to send ethier on that shallow fly ball by matt kemp which was the second out yes pierre might have gidpd in which case there still is a runner on third with two outs and no there is no guarantee he would have gotten a hit or a walk or gotten on base any other way but imho you have to at least take a shot at it instead of giving the opposition an out believe me brandon webb doesnt need any gift outs

292243 number two the building owners have gotten so greedy theyve raised the price on rent and raised the price on rent

292277 there is no greater problem facing average americans and small business today than high fuel costs and our nations dependency on foreign oil
292278 our proposal is not perfect but it is a bipartisan start on the road to a comprehensive energy strategy leading our nation to independence from foreign oil it will create new jobs from new technologies good for american wallets and our environment i am proud to be part of this bipartisan effort to address this serious problem
292279 offshore drilling with the consent of the states is an integral part of any energy independence plan
292280 there is no doubt we need more domestic exploration every barrel of oil we can find in america will be one less we have to compete with china and india for or be subject to opec price setting the more domestic energy we can locate and utilize the better
292281 since the 1970s our country has had an irrational view of nuclear power
292282 this view is best demonstrated by our nations refusal to allow recycling of spent fuel rods for decades the french japanese and british have all been recycling spent fuel surely this is an instance were we can be as bold as the french
292283 our proposal also commits billions for research development and purchases of alternative fuel vehicles
292284 we call for an apollo project like effort to support the goal of transitioning 85 percent of american new motor vehicles to non petroleum based fuels within the next 20 years
292285 quite frankly this particular tax incentive was never asked for by the oil companies
292286 it is irrational to be allocating around 1 billion per year in tax dollars to assist in production at a time when oil is 124 per barrel and companies are recording record profits
292287 it is clear to the american people their congress is broken i appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to try to jumpstart serious discussions on how to solve americas energy crisis
292288 it is my hope that this group will provide some reassurance to the american people that we still can work together and find common ground on the important problems facing every american family and business i hope that over the congressional recess support will build for this common sense balanced approach to making our nation more energy independent

292298 estaremos exponiendo al cuestionamiento la empresa privada y el libre mercado que existe en chile
292299 un libre mercado chileno no puede tener fallas porque habemos municipios que est n implementando una pol tica p blica de acuerdo a la legalidad vigente y por lo tanto el estado m s all del ministerio de salud y la empresa privada tienen que garantizar el tema de la entrega de la p ldora de manera absoluta

292321 most of the people have already made their plans youre going to see a lot of people coming up from the lower mainland over the connector or through manning park and into our area
292322 we are asking people to just take a deep breath and slow down a little bit you may be delayed for a short time but a passing lane will come up and youll be able to get around the people without too much problem to yourself
292323 pay really close attention and it really is so simple to put it out at the end of the day were telling people to just add water and stir
292324 thats the key thing stir up that fire make sure its good and cold because unfortunately we are still finding a number of campfires out there that are not being attended or people have left the site and the fires are still warm or hot in some cases
292325 sometime this rain although it can be a blessing for the fire hazard it also can be a curse because it gives folks a false sense of security while we did get some rain we are still at a high hazard and with just a little bit of sunny weather we can bounce back quickly from that moisture so we need people to remember we are still at a high hazard and there still is potential for fires to spread out there

292339 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
292340 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
292341 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
292342 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
292343 our study suggests that demyelinated tissues produce signals that can enhance the generation of new neurons in damaged areas of the brain based on our findings there is enough evidence to support the idea that new neurons can re grow in multiple sclerosis lesions

292367 ive decided to approach todays chat as a wine writer would today i am inaugurating the whine enthusiast in which i will rate your whines
292368 g a ve british prime minister gordon brown some management advice over the weekend
292369 this column incorrectly said that sen barack obama shared his views on how to avoid micromanagement with british prime minister gordon brown last saturday obama shared those views with british opposition leader david cameron
292370 inside according to a witness he told the house members this is the moment
292371 milbank cited the quote in support of his thesis that obama was becoming a
292372 suggest ed that obama was beginning to believe his own hype
292373 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that obama was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
292374 house democratic aides getting up thursday morning and decid ing that the quotes looked bad
292375 i do wonder whether or not echoing a misquote is really your best starting point
292376 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
292377 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
292378 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
292379 the enthusiasm is not about me at all milbank cited a comment that means nearly the opposite of the interpretation milbank gave it if the leadership aides version is accurate
292380 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
292381 it should be noted if it hasnt already that nobody is questioning the accuracy of the obama quotes only the context
292382 his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
292383 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
292384 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
292385 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
292386 i think it is hypocrisy personified that spurs are complaining about things they themselves have done
292387 they took away our manager i think tottenhams style is demonstrated by the way they contracted juande ramos
292388 sevilla have a claim against juande and juande has a claim against us and it is being dealt with in the courts of our city
292389 it is not a case for fifa only for the normal courts it has nothing to do with tottenham just sevilla and juande
292390 one of the worst offences by any manager in the premier league to date
292391 capel is not for sale so it is very difficult for tottenham
292392 they have tried on a couple of occasions to obtain his services but we do not want to sell he is a young player of great promise a youngster who still has lots to do and we want him to succeed in the next few years with sevilla
292393 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal when we started talking about my contract i never told ars ne wenger id be leaving this club and he knew my desire my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father
292394 i felt this year we were destabilsed by some clubs who did not completely respect the fair play rules in tapping up players
292395 we suffered from that at the end of the season we havent done that but it has been done to us there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players they think they can just come in and take them
292396 there are possibly four or five strikers who could come to our club and of course adebayor is one of them
292397 last year we lost the championship by four points and we feel we were very unlucky
292398 we have won championships with 78 points this year we want to make another step forward
292399 if we can do one more signing we will but it will need to buy the requested quality
292400 its not just to buy its getting the right person and that is at the moment very difficult its not a real problem because we have enough young players who can step in if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it if not we will give this position to somebody else
292401 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
292402 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
292403 any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
292404 david moyes and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign
292405 i appreciate that waiting can be hard and that patience is invariably in short supply but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season
292406 we cannot hide the fact that we need new players at everton
292407 it is ok getting fit but you have got to be able to play better at the moment there is not enough competition for the players to realise that if they play poorly they will not be selected
292408 i think its a very fashionable thing to start tapping young players in england
292409 i think its something thats happening all the time in the world of football its almost like anything goes
292410 moy was serving really well and i was making unforced errors the humidity gets to your breathing at the start but i managed to get it together
292411 he was playing too well for me and i was sluggish at the start
292412 but i managed to turn it around with some big serving halfway through the second set when you are playing someone like carlos who can make you do a lot of running you get out of breath quickly and you have to try to make the best of it try to get some cheap points on your serve and i managed to do that in the end
292413 we all know i havent scored the runs so far this year in test cricket and of course you feel under a lot of pressure
292414 not so much from the outside but from knowing you have to contribute and feeling youre letting the team down when you dont
292415 professional sport is a tough industry when youre not doing your job and as a batsman youve got to go out and score runs and i havent been doing that
292416 he said something important to me before i went out to bat dont be reckless but be aggressive i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper to go out there and take the bowlers on thats how i play my best cricket
292417 but i played a similar kind of innings then its not the first time ive been under that kind of pressure
292418 everyone realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and theyve been saying a score is just round the corner today proves that everyone is thrilled to bits for me but weve still got a massive job to do
292419 we certainly need a few more runs i think hopefully monty panesar will get a few to turn out there but well have to wait and see how long we can bat
292420 very very disappointing it simply wasnt good enough we played with emotional energy rather than intelligent energy but weve got a gift with the second new ball first thing and the games still on a knife edge hats off to colly though he was written off before this knock
292421 we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about
292422 you can set up the most brilliant plans in the world but you still have to execute them we wanted to have colly feeling outside off stump and he got off the mark pulling that said everything about our performance but he played unbelievably well under the pressure
292423 excessive absenteeism and a lack of engagement could be a problem particularly as the olympics will be going on during office hours
292424 we estimate that the olympics could cost britain up to 600 000 in lost productivity
292425 people spend more during big sporting events the world cup added around 1bn to the economy
292426 we are going to see much more digital consumption of these olympics with people using pdas and mobiles to get their olympic updates
292427 the way we consume news has changed and what we are likely to see is employees getting a quick sporting fix in bite sized chunks and then getting on with their work
292428 we want people to connect with what is happening on the other side of the world if we lose employees attention for the 10 seconds of the 100m i dont think we have to be too worried
292429 organisations need to be aware that this type of event generates a huge amount of interest and they need to be flexible but firm
292430 there is no need to be a spoilsport but staff may need to be reminded that they still have contractual requirements and if they are switching off it may be their colleagues who have to shoulder the burden
292431 the chinese community is extremely excited about the olympics there has been a lot of bad press but this really is the first chance for our mother country to show the world what it can do
292432 the culmination of all the hard work weve put in over the last few years
292433 ive never said this to anyone before but after that last operation i did think will he ever be the same again i could never share that with fred because you have to be upbeat so to see him come in the other night was fantastic and a massive relief
292434 part of the problem was the muscle wasting that went on so we had to build him up all over again
292435 it was really important to get a full six months with him this time rather than just three but it was still quite a journey
292436 by the time we got to cape town where we spent 10 days in january he was running again but we had to gradually reintegrate him it was also a question of mentally moving him away from being my patient to being a cricketer the lions tour to india in february helped that process as did lancashires pre season trip to dubai thursday evening was a moment of huge pride for me but ive had great support from the ecb especially hugh morris the england teams managing director
292437 in some ways it got him hungrier and he trained harder again
292438 im very proud of the fact that he can now bowl like that but ill be happier once hes got through a full series and had no reaction i am optimistic hes fitter and stronger than ever if he keeps fit keeps doing his rehab and prehab and looks after the ankle he can be around for a long time
292439 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal when we started talking about my contract i never told ars ne wenger id be leaving this club and he knew my desire my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father
292440 i felt this year we were destabilsed by some clubs who did not completely respect the fair play rules in tapping up players

292449 any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
292450 david moyes and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign
292451 i appreciate that waiting can be hard and that patience is invariably in short supply but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season

292462 they have tried on a couple of occasions to obtain his services but we do not want to sell he is a young player of great promise a youngster who still has lots to do and we want him to succeed in the next few years with sevilla
292463 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery i have never mentioned that for ronaldo
292464 not to join high profile committees to help fundraise for tate
292465 buildings come and go directors come and go the art is the constant
292466 the tate is an instrument of state in a way that moma could never be for good and for bad
292467 we are an instrument of the public which owns the tate while moma is governed by a very small group of wealthy individuals and so it necessarily reflects the values of a narrower cross section of society
292468 the met is not a public museum whereas the british museum is a public institution and the public museums of london have always been free to everyone
292469 i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
292470 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult
292471 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
292472 firstly the second game is at home which is really really important im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
292473 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent time withnewcastle axel witsel is a good young player and wilfried dalmat is probably the best player in their team alexandre da silva is a good defender as well so we know they wont be easy opposition overall though it is a good draw and we are happy
292474 i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
292475 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult
292476 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
292477 firstly the second game is at home which is really really important im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
292478 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent time withnewcastle axel witsel is a good young player and wilfried dalmat is probably the best player in their team alexandre da silva is a good defender as well so we know they wont be easy opposition overall though it is a good draw and we are happy
292479 before the game i said to the players that if we have penalties after the game id choose the players to take them
292480 i told them it was my choice and if we didnt win itd be my mistake not theirs we do need to change the situation because we will have penalty shoot outs again but one penalty will not change my idea of shevchenko
292481 id say the reason he has not had the same impact as he did in italy is that when he moved to chelsea from milan that is a hard thing to do
292482 he had to move to another country and the environment changed
292483 all these factors obviously affected his condition hes trying to play the way he can i believe he has great talent and we have seen that many times if he overcomes these problems which are mostly psychological and i think because he moved to a different country then he will achieve a lot in the chelsea team i believe he can still achieve that
292484 using these things you can get things in the mail that people bring to your house
292485 investors have penalized rupert for his acquisition of dow jones which continues to be hampered by the deteriorating fundamentals of the print newspaper business
292486 the economy has severely dampened the demand for advertising and that could continue for some time
292487 given the decline in newspaper valuations since the acquisition it appears news corp could have gotten it a lot cheaper what was the rush
292488 while we cannot defend the price paid for dow jones nor can we fathom why news corp has continued to operate own the money losing new york post for years understanding the components of news corp s business highlights stark differences with pure play u s newspaper stocks which should drive a less negative view
292489 newspapers are simply not a reason to avoid owning news corp shares particularly at todays valuation
292490 were really excited that were owned by news corp its a very diverse global operation
292491 as a standalone dow jones was a 1 8 billion company access to capital was limited now access is still not easy but we would not have been able to make the acquisitions we just made
292492 when an executive leaves a business he probably has money to invest

292496 we can adopt our own indigenous solutions which are less expensive and are 100 sure of preventing the spread of this deadly disease i find it very baffling how we could throw away what worked and embrace ideas from elsewhere then we watched as rates of infection soared again to claim lives
292497 for every african who gains access to hiv treatment six become newly infected
292498 to treat one aids patient with life prolonging anti retroviral drugs costs more than 1 000 a year our successful abc campaign cost just 29 cents per person each year
292499 viciously homophobic countries like jamaica pakistan saudi arabia uganda iraq and nigeria
292500 tyrannies should not be rewarded no us aid for anti gay regimes
292501 theyre rich in love so theyre ready to take the next step
292502 she has her heart set on one place in particular a cozy four bedroom three bath spanish style house in the hollywood hills
292503 shes been dreaming of owning a home for the last year and now shes finally ready to pluck down the 2 3 million for the house
292504 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
292505 it was one of those things where we were like wow
292506 i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life
292507 i spoke to her like three or four times and had no idea
292508 you can imagine shes 14 years old shes streetwise but shes not that streetwise
292509 she looked like she had just robbed a bank or something
292510 it appears that there were several people involved and thats what were looking into is who played what role
292511 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
292512 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
292513 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
292514 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
292515 will also give us time to focus on restoring momentum in our core business and for consumers in general to regain their footing and confidence
292516 mhg does not intend to further extend the joint venture agreement on its current terms but expects to evaluate future proposals relating to the project with boyd

292519 so greg how are you helping your buyers and sellers make a good decision given all the economic and housing news
292520 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails
292521 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
292522 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills

292541 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
292542 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
292543 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
292544 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
292545 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
292546 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life

292566 in a field that has recently grown in recognition we look forward to sharing our expertise and increasing students knowledge as they prepare to enter the professional world of communication
292567 the nj iabc is very supportive this organization will undoubtedly be an invaluable opportunity for student communicators to learn and grow this is the beginning of a new adventure and i am excited to be a part of it
292568 i now understand no contact means no contact or a probation officers prior permission is required

292576 but we do know that we have lost business as we anticipated we would
292577 this is a real hit to the bottom line but we hold to the hope that eventually people may adjust more to the regulations and as suggested in other provinces they do tend over the long period of time to come back
292578 but weve also seen in other provinces in saskatchewan horrendous losses and we have seen businesses close as a result of the smoking regulations so i guess time will only tell

292602 if this is from the daschle powder it could be re aerosolized and somebody could get hurt really bad if its from ordinary culture its not that dangerous
292603 im not convinced i know the source of the contamination
292604 the message here from a scientific and policy standpoint is profound
292605 facilities that are medical and microbiological may not be suitably equipped for dealing with aerosolized versions of the organisms that they otherwise deal with in great safety these facilities probably ought not be located in a heavily populated area how do you contain smoke
292606 the chance that theyll be working in the same rushed atmosphere they faced at fort detrick is very small

292722 congress is sending a strong message that intellectual property is worth protecting
292723 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
292724 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
292725 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
292726 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
292727 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
292728 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
292729 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
292730 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
292731 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
292732 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
292733 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
292734 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks

292830 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their many events
292831 they push all these sexuality issues so intensively into the conference and then blame us for talking about them too much
292832 in the attitude of some north american churches i am reminded of the arrogance of the american administration that made a mess in iraq because it refused to listen to the millions of voices from the wider world
292833 we think that any centralisation of power will take us away from historic anglicanism
292834 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

292850 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
292851 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
292852 i know we threw a lot of off speed stuff theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win
292853 you can tell theyre excited to be here and also they have an idea of what theyre doing
292854 its hard because those are three really important players on this team
292855 you can say that but i think you have to give their pitcher credit for once
292856 i mean he pitched a great game we havent seen him and we didnt have a lot of footage and from what we saw he was definitely better than what we saw on video i cant say 100 percent that we didnt have a letdown but you definitely have to give that kid credit it would be a shame not to give him the credit that he deserves
292857 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
292858 i think 95 wins is a reasonable estimate for a playoff team if a team wins 95 theyre probably in and they aren t well thats disapointing but its hard to consider 95 wins a failure happily for me who likes things that are easy to work out if the yankees are to reach that number they need to win exactly two thirds of their remaining games

292860 this week im playing well again you know hopefully i can do it

292862 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance im playing well enough and can hopefully come through

292867 i have three gorgeous girls a gorgeous wife a comfortable existence ive played footy on the mcg for afl side melbourne clean bowled an australian batsman justin langer in an exhibition game

292890 many of us have heard stories about chinas gulags but when you discover how close some of these hellholes are to olympic venues its sickening

292892 it should particularly aid journalists in investigating the plight of adherents of the falun gong who make up a huge percentage of labor camp detainees and have suffered a brutal campaign of persecution for nine years
292893 request that colleagues outside china e mail or fax a copy of the guide to you inside china
292894 once you have obtained a copy please re post it on other websites blogs etc by creating multiple copies on the web the chinese governments blocking of the original becomes obsolete
292895 the ministry really has to realize that the scooter style is working the open frame is not
292896 whats preventing these from proliferating is that the marketing is hesitant because at the end of the day who knows how the pilot project will end up

292898 why cant they tell the difference between a scooter and an electric bike its just one of interest and communication
292899 were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties
292900 that whole pc first thing you have to go back in id history to see why id initially developed for the pc
292901 wolfenstein 3d there was a nintendo version of that that was like a black day in id history how they made us change it to run on the nintendo platform
292902 wouldnt let you publish games on the console we didnt want to have our content governed by a third party
292903 but that dynamic isnt really like there anymore there are lots of games that have content whether its language or other forms of adult content that is pushing the bounds of content on all platforms
292904 we need to have all of these coordinated and released at the same time because thats the way to get your game out to the most people
292905 i think there are still some problems in the pc market
292906 there are issues in the market from a business standpoint which means having a pc only title that the level of investment to make a triple a game is a tough thing if your not doing a subscription model
292907 to open that up for the type of games we make isnt really appealing to us
292908 world of warcraft i can understand that they have a service based aspect to that game with our games we have always been about the free multiplayer stuff
292909 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares

292911 there was never any doubt about the position of this board and its openness to do a deal at no point did the board despite rumour or speculation did we ever resist we actively engaged with them
292912 we called the shots and we were deeply involved in the process there was never a conversation in more than 30 meetings when we did not discuss shareholder value
292913 they verbally in an offhand comment and this is important they said there may be a few more dollars on the table they never communicated this to the board or in writing
292914 and to this day i do not know why they did that
292915 jag tror s kert att det finns m nga intresserade
292916 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review
292917 the word change normally refers to new beginnings but transformation the mystery were examining more often happens not when something new begins but when something old falls apart the pain of something old falling apart chaos invites the soul to listen at a deeper level it invites and sometimes forces the soul to go to a new place because the old place is falling apart most of us would never go to new places in any other way the mystics use many words to describe this chaos fire darkness death emptiness abandonment trial the evil one whatever it is it does not feel good and it does not feel like god you will do anything to keep the old thing from falling apart this is when you need patience and guidance and the freedom to let go instead of tightening your controls and certitudes a change can force a transformation spiritual transformation always includes a usually disconcerting reorientation it can either help people to find a new meaning or it can force people to close down and turn slowly bitter the difference is determined precisely by the quality of our inner life our spirituality change just happens but transformation is always a process of letting go living in the confusing dark space for awhile and eventually being spit up on a new and unexpected shore you can see why jonah in the belly of the whale is such an important symbol for many jews and christians god lets jonah run in the wrong direction but finds a long suffering circuitous path to get him back where he needs to be and in spite of himself that is patient inner transformation

292921 sia perch il contratto viene sottoscritto prima delle ferie estive e quindi sar possibile la sua concreta attuazione entro lanno sia per la carica innovativa della definizione di progetti gestionale ciascun dipendente del parco conoscer quindi quali sono gli obiettivi che lente richiede quali sono i compiti che gli vengono prioritariamente assegnati e sar pi agevole stabilire con criteri oggettivi lapporto di ognuno
292922 la carica positiva di questo accordo che segna chiaramente una svolta nella organizzazione e nella gestione del personale e delle attivit operative

292959 adriana lukas has given me a completely new outlook on creating distributing and sharing media i have worked for 30 years in television broadcasting and corporate video but have been given a completely new and refreshing set of skills which will transform in a positive way the way i do my job ive never been more excited about the possibilities that offer themselves and adrianas expertise and knowledge has opened those doors in the same way that she has brought me a new and expanded way of thinking about my job adriana has also brought a cultural change to johnson amp johnson as a corporation we tend to be rather conservative and slow to change but adrianas dynamism has lit a lot of fires i feel that our company will be very well served by her counsel and more amenable to positive change to anyone considering bringing adriana in to their company i would say that she has a unique and dynamic style which will encourage positive transformation within any organization her knowledge and energy are boundless and she brings great value and cutting edge skills to the table
292960 i can tell you first hand that the big blog company is a savvy operation the tbbc people certainly know their stuff
292961 i can say with some confidence that adriana understands social media better than any other individual with whom i am familiar she spotted the implications of blogging for business in early 2003 and started the big blog company then you could say she pre dates the social media for enterprise bandwagon adriana is nothing less than a whirlwind force of constructive disruption in the companies she consults as she certainly has been in my professional life she helps businesses to bring about positive change and clear results both internally and externally giving them the tools they need to do so and showing them exactly how to use them in the process she motivates individuals and transforms how they do their jobs helping them to be more effective and more purposeful as people i would recommend adriana both as a consultant and as a speaker having seen her give brilliant presentations on many occasions it is a distinct honour for my non profit that she agreed to be a founding member of our advisory board in short adriana is an amazing person get in touch with her and your life truly will be touched

292993 desde el m s absoluto respeto al disenso y al pluralismo pol tico
292994 creo que puede ser el momento de lanzar un mensaje a los ciudadanos para que entendamos que para hacerse respetar para llevar a cabo una pol tica propia y para defender los intereses leg timos que a cada uno nos corresponde no es preciso negar al otro rechazar cualquier iniciativa que no sea la propia y oponerse a decisiones que nos gusten o no han sido adoptadas por quien leg timamente tiene competencia para ello
292995 lo que los ciudadanos perciben es que para intervenir en pol tica para participar en las decisiones p blicas la nica forma de hacerlo es mediante la oposici n sistem tica a las decisiones de los poderes p blicos
292996 lejos de reforzar la democracia y la participaci n lo que hace es degradar la labor pol tica
292997 la pol tica del no no se dirige s lo contra una determinada administraci n p blica antes al contrario tarde o temprano la sufrimos todos y ello porque se trata de un problema cultural

293004 hay que hablar con el gobierno y tambi n con el cabildo porque si ste tiene dinero para un metro deber a tenerlo tambi n para guaguas

293086 the really big striking contrast between working at no 10 and government departments is the extent to which the economy dominates whether it is gas prices mortgage starts the insolvencies the edf takeover of british energy all the economic news that is about peoples standard of living and prospects for the future
293087 we have to make sure that everything is put in place as much as possible to make sure they are fully protected
293088 it was also very timely for me to be there at the 10th anniversary of the national minimum wages since i invented the low pay commission when i was in opposition as a shadow employment secretary
293089 he was not at all ringing up saying dont do this or do that but gordon and i have worked together for 25 years so we kind of understand each other
293090 over the years it has gone from awe to admiration to attitude it is very interesting
293091 i think we did good on their pick and roll and then in the second half they exposed us for a little bit
293092 buckled down defensively in that third quarter and opened the game up
293093 he had a great game against us a few years ago
293094 i knew about jasikevicius athens performance prior to tonights game they reminded me of it so just sick the doberman on him
293095 just run the floor and try to get open shots they found me in good spots to score
293096 the one thing that we did was try to get out early and run instead of rebounding i think tonight we did a good job of staying in as a team team rebounding and then pushing down the floor
293097 it would surprise me if they thought he would come back for the veterans minimum
293098 ive known rockets owner leslie alexander for a long time dikembe has a very good relationship with les well get together when we get back and see if there can be a situation for dikembe to consider playing another season
293099 i dont know if what were doing has been decided were planning to sit down with dikembe it looks like after the olympics we hope to convince him to return
293100 he said some real nice things i really appreciate it it was nice of him
293101 he is happy as he can be to be put in a situation to compete for a championship hes ecstatic
293102 definitely playing with tracy ive got a guy that can take over a game
293103 i got my thing i can take over a game defensively
293104 me and shane have been playing together for quite some time every time we played its always a battle when we first played against each other 15 years ago shane used to be way bigger than me i really admire shane because shane at duke was the star and hes still playing defense hitting big 3s and is such important part of the houston rockets thats why i wouldnt mind coming off the bench as a sixth man or seventh man
293105 im one of the top thee or four two way players in the game i do love to play defense i got scoring all around me now i can just contribute
293106 i am happy im always happy i have family a beautiful wife four kids im always in good spirits always happy im blessed
293107 i guess over time you get to know people the first day is the interesting day the next days always get better i dont want to write a book in the newspaper today we will over time
293108 theres a line that separates having confidence and being conceited i dont cross that line but i have a lot of confidence in myself
293109 thats what i said i am a confident player and a lot of people might look at it like oh another cocky attitude but i dont look at it that way
293110 i have an opinion i have a right to have one and thats the way i feel i felt ive played against the best over the years and felt right now that im the best player in the world
293111 you could have asked me about any other player and i would have given you the same answer
293112 i would have said that if he thought bryant was conceited
293113 i think the lakers are a great team but i think they ran into a better team
293114 they lakers beat the best in all the western conference they had the guy who was named mvp and the best record after the arrival of pau gasol but they just ran up against the better team
293115 i think they will be a great team next year maybe well see them back in the finals

293123 transfer pricing by multinational enterprises can pose challenges for irs and u s regulators
293124 because multinational operations and transactions can be quite complex and pricing methods may be inexact evaluating the appropriateness of particular transfer prices can be difficult
293125 facts that represent the potential crown jewels of the company

293130 kozens has some really good speed at running back if i had those running backs and that line i think id run the ball and see what happens we know if we cant stop the run were going to get a heavy dose of that weve told our front seven that
293131 we could run 80 percent spread and 20 percent i or we could go 80 percent i and 20 percent spread we just dont know right now well see how they react to both sets
293132 size wise i do like the way we match up this year
293133 i really like our two big tight ends adam chicoine burlington and andrew baker rutland
293134 in practice we looked really polished were ready were game ready

293142 there is no doubt that this offer was made in the name of the usa
293143 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal with radovan karadzic
293144 why would anyone believe one of the most dangerous and awful mass murderers in modern history
293145 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
293146 unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
293147 when it was noticed that they were acting selectively and were reluctant to take exculpatory documents
293148 we realized that we had been tricked and that they were not investigators from the tribunal but investigators from the office of the prosecutor who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal permission
293149 unknown civilians showed me a badge so quickly that i could not identify it took me out of a public transport vehicle and held me in an unknown place for 74 hours
293150 speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger but not at all in matters of law and justice
293151 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
293152 the indictment also charges karadzic with responsibility for a protracted campaign of shelling and sniping of civilian areas of sarajevo killing and wounding thousands of civilians including children and the elderly

293156 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
293157 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
293158 a large number of variations in the appearance of normal female genitalia
293159 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
293160 its an unfortunate situation but also understandable why theyre being taken away
293161 its certainly disappointing but we have to be prudent in what were doing
293162 we had some tough conversations with department heads who were defending their employees but i tried to approach it from both a management and taxpayer basis
293163 were not going to reduce our service to the public
293164 thats why were having this appeals process to ensure were being fair and equitable well be open to anything they have to say
293165 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
293166 olmert told us his goal is to reach an agreement on paper
293167 reach an agreement with the palestinians during the time he has left
293168 any agreement he reaches with the palestinians wont be a personal agreement and he will make sure that the new kadima leadership is briefed and on board
293169 at this time of change in the government we must not reach agreements on the core issues in negotiations with the palestinians
293170 anything that is decided now is very problematic because it is happening before the change in the government and against the background of instability on the palestinian side
293171 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
293172 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
293173 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
293174 i am a democrat and here is my energy plan
293175 i just saw one of the democrats interviewed on television the question was if oil was 10 a gallon and you knew exactly where to get it in alaska or on the coast would you drill there and there was no answer
293176 sarah and matthew have been struggling for years now that news of matthews cheating has broken they have decided to make things work especially for the sake of their son james

293178 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
293179 todays decision by the federal communications commission will go down in history as one of the most important milestones in the fight for an open accessible internet
293180 this is a landmark decision for the fcc a meaningful stride forward on the road to guaranteed openness of the internet we recognize that protecting internet openness is like protecting the internets immune system safeguarding it from bugs and infections that could slow its circulation make it sick maybe even kill it
293181 for us to enjoy online video without interruption or distortion video bits have to be given priority over say e mail bits but now that all traffic must be treated equally that is going to change the new regime is tantamount to a congested downtown area without stoplights gridlock is likely to result
293182 by depriving engineers of the freedom to manage these surges of information flow by having to treat all traffic equally as the result of todays order the information superhighway could quickly become the information parking lot
293183 for the first time today our government is choosing regulation over collaboration when it comes to internet governance
293184 so today for the first time in internet history we say goodbye to the era of collaboration that served the internet community and consumers so well for so long and we say hello to unneeded regulation and all of its unintended consequences

293189 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
293190 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain if offering
293191 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
293192 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year
293193 you cant get out backwards you gotta go forwards to go back better press on
293194 its becoming a more acceptable piece of technology for older adults
293195 used to be there just for safety reasons but its become a tool theyre comfortable with
293196 ive told them not to send me any because i have to pay every time i get one
293197 so why would anyone not store their contact list on a sim card
293198 my hope is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our government were not seeing the growth wed like to see but the financial system is basically sound
293199 the contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions the effects of the housing contraction and of the financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation against this backdrop economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year while inflation has remained elevated
293200 the economy continues to face numerous difficulties including ongoing strains in financial markets declining house prices a softening labor market and rising prices of oil food and some other commodities the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the united states triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress in part because the outlook for the economy and thus for credit quality remains uncertain
293201 in the housing sector activity continues to weaken home prices are falling particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade the declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale these foreclosures have in turn intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas the declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale these foreclosures have in turn intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year
293202 it feels like the summer of 1931 the worlds two biggest financial institutions have had a heart attack the global currency system is breaking down the policy doctrines that got us into this mess are bankrupt no world leader seems able to discern the problem let alone forge a solution the international monetary fund has abdicated into schizophrenia my view is that a dollar crash will be averted as it becomes clearer that contagion has spread worldwide but we are now at the point of maximum danger
293203 the global economy is at the point of maximum danger
293204 investors worldwide are betting more than 1 trillion on a collapse in stock prices
293205 why does paulson keep telling us that the banking system is sound every time he gets within 200 of a microphone maybe it is because the banking system is on the verge of all out collapse and he knows you could blow it over with a feather
293206 the existence of gses is a major part of the overall u s subsidization of housing capital that will eventually lead to the bankruptcy of the u s economy for the last 70 years investment in housing the most unproductive form of accumulation of capital has been heavily subsidized in 100 different ways in the u s tax benefits tax deductibility of interest on mortgages use of the fha massive role of fannie and freddie role of the federal home loan bank system and a host of other legislative and regulatory measures the reality is that the u s has invested too much especially in the last eight years in building its stock of wasteful housing capital whose effect on the productivity of labor is zero and has not invested enough in the accumulation of productive physical capital equipment machinery etc that leads to an increase in the productivity of labor and increases long run economic growth this financial crisis is a crisis of accumulation of too much debt by the household sector the government and the country to finance the accumulation of the most useless and unproductive form of capital housing that provides only housing services to consumers and has zippo effect on the productivity of labor
293207 the companies have also been unwilling to accept the pain of market prices in acknowledging delinquent loans when borrowers fail to keep up payments on mortgages in the pool that supports asset backed loans fannie and freddie must buy back the loan but that requires an immediate write off at a time when the market prices of asset backed loans are depressed instead the twins sometimes pay the interest into the pool to keep the loans afloat in mr rosners view this merely pushes the losses into the future
293208 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
293209 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
293210 google reader is good give google all of your data
293211 we must win in afghanistan there is no other option
293212 im used to getting a great deal of money for my district
293213 how much is the city paying for the building while its empty
293214 the citys been paying about 15 000 a month while the building has been empty
293215 i dont think the rule should have any attention paid to it becaus in congress we have our own rules
293216 but its not really free taxpayers are paying for it
293217 but it doesnt cause any difficulty to the community to take the money
293218 its taxpayers money in my view the congressman looks at federal earmarks the 5 6 million as play money
293219 estados unidos tiene una fuerte y creciente relaci n con brasil y colombia y espero trabajar con los funcionarios del gobierno y l deres del sector privado para hallar formas de que podamos responder a la creciente demanda global

293226 but i was looking at the weather reports coming in a few days before she was due to leave and said youll be lucky to go
293227 we were at dinner when the whole ship went over right over all the dishes went sliding off the tables and people slid off chairs i thought this is it
293228 the noise plates and glasses smashing people were screaming we were hanging on to the table as it was leaning over
293229 but i have to say the crew were fantastic they did everything they could to help and kept us informed and the captain was very apologetic about what was happening
293230 we are not going to ask the taxpayers of new zealand to wait 18 months to get their second round of tax cuts theyve waited far too long
293231 we are very close to the family of james te aute and the other victims in this trial and part of it was relief on out part on their behalf
293232 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
293233 there are deficiencies in the summing up and other matters
293234 there are always issues involved and there are some particular issues in this case there are some substantial ones
293235 at the end of the day the question is has the person received a fair trial if there are deficiencies in the summing up and the way it proceeds the defence is entitled to proceed and i am saying there are matters to be canvassed
293236 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
293237 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
293238 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
293239 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
293240 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
293241 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
293242 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
293243 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
293244 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
293245 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
293246 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
293247 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
293248 unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with its subscribers internet traffic
293249 the commission concluded that comcasts network management practices discriminate among applications rather than treating all equally and are inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet indeed the commission noted that comcast has an anticompetitive motive to interfere with customers use of peer to peer applications
293250 the commission also concluded that comcasts practices are not minimally intrusive as the company claims but rather are invasive and have significant effects in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
293251 sometime before the end of the year a timetable that martin previously questioned on its initial announcement as well as also announced collaborations with content delivery experts pando networks to
293252 repeated erroneous characterizations of comcasts network management practices that we have taken great pains to clarify on multiple occasions
293253 xanadu is a fun show for families and its a fun show for a date
293254 i am not as quick as i used to be
293255 but when you have a great piece that helps the entertainment is there its how you interpret it
293256 they lead me they know when i get lost they come and they dance over and take me where i need to be everybodys been really great about the fact that im not 100 percent solid but i will be by monday or tuesday of next week
293257 i came in to replace somebody people know im there so i dont need a special bow
293258 shes very naturally musical and has an instinctive grasp of pop
293259 whats nice about whoopi is that her voice matches her natural delivery in some people you get scared because their voice sounds like somebody else or sounds disembodied from who they are
293260 and then i got bored with it now im just trying to figure out whos going to come in it could be eartha kitt it could be anybody you never know who is going to show up
293261 for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf
293262 i believe we are on the cusp of getting money from another source
293263 its a story ive always wanted to tell because i always found her a fascinating woman
293264 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
293265 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
293266 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
293267 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
293268 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
293269 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
293270 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
293271 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
293272 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
293273 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
293274 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
293275 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
293276 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football
293277 the player field for this event is flat out amazing
293278 im leaving the business to provide for all of you
293279 its going to give jobs to you boys but its going to to be even more valuable for your mother she doesnt have any retirement savings this is her retirement
293280 solution i have replaced my bookmark with the link from your page now i dont have to think about it every future order automatically goes through your link
293281 youve got a nice warm dry place to work in here
293282 the eastman house southworth amp hawes show was a landmark exhibition there were literally hundreds of images from delicate tiny locket photos to spectacular whole plate daguerreotypes of unbelievable quality
293283 southworth amp hawes were sort of like the yousef karsh or annie leibovitz of their day
293284 imo their interest is historical only because any half way decent portrait photographer with his studio up a set of stairs over the hardware store on main street could have done just as well or better once the dry plate became available
293285 we need more reviews like this nobodys going to think this is a puff piece theyre going to believe his recommendations and that will sell units
293286 im keeping the camera and if you want it back come after me
293287 well these are all great cars in their own right
293288 i saw an odd magenta cast in some blacks likely this is a minor bug with the cameras color profile or software interpretation of the raw data that i expect be fixed in the release product
293289 no harm done but in my opinion not usually necessary either
293290 plus most reviewers try to avoid reviewing obvious dogs because its just not fun
293291 the fixed focal length non zoom lens produces below average results for both indoor and outdoor snapshots
293292 stop do not pass go do not give general electric 200 for the g1 with so many mediocre snapshot cameras on the market ya gotta wonder why anyone would feel compelled to offer another unless the people behind ges new camera line are drinking some doctored kool aid
293293 explore strategic options for consumer amp industrial with a focus on spin off
293294 in some of the most satisfying photo books the photographer has not even tried to reproduce literally the attributes of the original photographic print but rather has created a new rendition that reflects the craft attributes of the chosen book printing method
293295 actually there are three different expressions of this work since the book has also been sold in a limited edition with an accompanying gravure created by jon goodman
293296 there are so many web gurus with profitable sites telling you digital has far surpassed film as has digital printing i say bull i dont mean to get off the topic of vintage specialized printing methods but even traditional wet printing is now vintage sure most pros need to shoot digital to survive but for fine art b amp w film and traditional printing still has its place
293297 image loses in translation but that the object is torn asunder from its context
293298 great photo books you can buy new part i reissues
293299 the principal function of the printed picture in western europe and america has been obscured by the persistent habit of regarding prints as of interest and value only in so far as they can be regarded as works of art
293300 since the invention of writing there has been no more important invention than that of the exactly repeatable pictorial statement
293301 a photograph of a mountain means nothing to you if youve never seen a mountain
293302 a digital image of a daguerreotype seriously fails to do it justice
293303 this topic perhaps cast in somewhat wider terms is one that whole journalism courses are devoted to and its not an easy one
293304 i wont explain here but if you google reichmann leica m8 magenta review youll find more than you probably want to read
293305 a lot of people have reflexive reactions to this kind of thing usually publish and damn the consequences but the longer you think about it the more troubling the consequences become
293306 interestingly enough though he then published a column which recounted his reactions to the m8 and his decision not to refer to certain problems with the camera
293307 this whole issue is a bottomless bucket imho there is no answer to the problems created its something that has to be dealt with on a case by case basis in the reichmann case i believe i might have done the same thing he did right down the line i just wonder if id have had the balls to admit it later
293308 start with the premise that no one can be totally without bias an honest reviewer lays out his her bias at the beginning of the review the review should provide as much objective information as possible data and when the reviewer draws conclusions all caveats should be pointed out as well as the criteria for these conclusions unfortunately we as consumers audience are also part of the distortion how many of us can honestly say that we have read the article the first only time from beginning to end before skipping to the conclusions if we do the latter we become biased as to how we absorb the data thats what leads to all the fighting on internet fora
293309 personality where reviewers leave one title and go to another and expect their readers to do the same lifestyle when reviewers compare products to other prestige items they own imagine if a review ran i would recommend this tripod because it fits comfortably in the boot of my jag
293310 how can you watch a starving kid and still go back to your camp and eat a decent meal any reasonable person would give up their food and die with the starving kid the result would be that there would be no one to provide any assistance
293311 but i got a great big house on the hill here and a great big blonde wife inside it and a great big pool in my backyard and another great big pool beside it sonny its money that matters hear what i say its money that matters in the usa its money that matters now you know that its true its money that matters whatever you do
293312 which is why im asking you whether your no cash policy has to do with cambodian culture society or with you
293313 as for a zoom well do you really want to do all your photography at one focal length
293314 in all the discussion of large sensor compact cameras ive read ive yet to hear a good explanation i assume it has something to do with the angle at which the light must strike the sensor but thats my only guess any of the enlightened readers contributers here at top care to explain
293315 i do hope sigma sells enough dp1s to make a version 2 worthwhile
293316 but with the electronic sensor live view which will continue to improve is the better way
293317 dont worry dad a family of dorks will come along any minute
293318 i like crocs theyre so comfortable ill tell you who the dork is the guy writing this story thats who and who died and made him the fashion authority anyway
293319 was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no
293320 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
293321 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution
293322 which were once so popular that the company couldnt keep pace with demand are now piling up in warehouses
293323 today are available all over the world and on the internet as we continue to significantly expand all aspects of our business
293324 today ill leave the house wearing these neon green dutch bubble shoes with swiss cheese holes in them maybe ill even buy some little plastic strawberries or bananas and jam them in the sweat holes just to jazz things up and make the bacteria incubate faster
293325 i did find it interesting that based on a justifiable skepticism in the prospect of truly integrated schools and an equally justified concern over the desperate condition of many inner city schools a slim majority of you favored the idea of a ujamaa type program
293326 from classifying any individual by race ethnicity color or national origin
293327 broader perspective on whether the use of racial classifications by the state should in fact be rethought
293328 i have a sister who is half indonesian who is married to a chinese canadian
293329 there is a real choice in the 2008 presidential election
293330 the choice is to vote for none of the above its the only choice that makes sense its the only choice that will make a real difference for the future of our country its the only choice that is moral and justifiable from both a pragmatic point of view as well as an idealistic one
293331 in all honesty the choices put before us this year by the two major parties make george bush look like george washington by comparison
293332 dont believe the experts theyre not looking deeply enough at whats happening out there in the grass roots
293333 i dont think americans have really considered how powerful it is to vote no the soviet union imploded when russians said no no is a very powerful word it is a revolutionary word and america is in need of a political revolution a revolution that gives voters real choices
293334 how can any of us be a part of knowingly sending america on the wrong course
293335 many people who believe in these principles principles most closely associated with the republican party think holding your nose and voting for john mccain is the right thing to do in 2008
293336 i disagree if mccain wins he will have done it his way with an incoherent platform that promotes global warming hysteria embryonic stem cell research unconstitutional restrictions on first amendment freedoms more illegal immigration etc
293337 i need some really good photos so ill hire a student
293338 if you bought a mac within the past couple years it should have some version of imovie on it already
293339 when a spouse dies we call the person left behind a widow or a widower if a child loses their parents we call them an orphan when a child dies and their parents are still alive there is no term some things are just too horrific to have a title
293340 nichole3 wrote in the comments section about her history with clotheslines
293341 i had no dryer a great deal of the time my children were growing up i always had my clothsline full if we had special plans on the weekend i started washing friday night and got up early saturday mornings to have my entire clothesline filled with four children i always had to wash at least 2 loads a day i have to admit it was not always fun i use my line now mainly for sheets and blankets
293342 just because i can belly up to the trough it doesnt mean that i have to
293343 de acordo com a pesquisa apesar de as loiras naturais ou n o ganharem menos e levarem desvantagem na vida amorosa os tons dourados s o os que as mulheres passam mais tempo usando e ficam em m dia seis anos pintando os cabelos nessas tonalidades com freq ncia

293345 can you believe erik was fatally stabbed by an umbrella brutal man
293346 huh youre just screwing with me again arent ya and hey whats a cornhole
293347 the new york police departments resources were hard pressed fighting major crimes like murder arson extortion but they undertook a small details oriented policy shift more attention on the petty issues pushing everyday life in the city guality of life crimes
293348 paying attention to petty crime made the city more attractive to live in and also dramatically reduced major crime
293349 angelina would own the part my industry friends tell me she has made inquiries about the role i can understand how it would pique her interest catwoman is batmans one true love shes tremendously popular with women because shes both a heroine and a villainess
293350 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
293351 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
293352 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
293353 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
293354 sometimes one must go a very long distance out of his way only to make small progress in the big picture
293355 i personally have not seen that much heroin in one location
293356 i have some magic powers and i want your magic powers and revenge for my daddy whom i dont care about
293357 we have to admit that we think of him when taking off our shoes at the airport for the love of alex please let us retain our flip flop freedoms tsa
293358 we strongly believe that smoking should only be a prerogative of adults who are aware of the risks posed by smoking and can therefore make an informed decision
293359 the ban against smoking in public places is a measure taken to protect the youth and other members of the public from unnecessary exposure and should therefore be supported by all
293360 what they are saying simply is that they like to make money but they would like to make money by selling tobacco to those that are conscious about their decision to smoke
293361 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
293362 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
293363 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates

293374 the us has used the manta base for the past decade to lead anti drug flights throughout latin america
293375 i like the way that the liberals whether they are catholic or protestant like to believe that they have all the answers
293376 they wont be happy until we have a leftist goverment in washington
293377 the united states has done more good in the world since ww1 than any other country
293378 the problem with liberals is that they cant see beyond their nose
293379 on the contrary they are not there is quite a lot of debate about what the words mean especially due to historical change
293380 i wasnt aware that they put it to a vote
293381 the ecuadorian people do not want foreign troops on our soil and the government has to follow the mandate of its people
293382 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
293383 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony

293411 scientific studies over the past 10 years show benefits from vinegar consumption
293412 its inexpensive and can be easily incorporated into the diet used in combination with type 2 diabetes
293413 we documented small but important average decreases in hemoglobin a1c in people with type 2 diabetes over the course of 12 weeks taking a couple teaspoons of apple cider vinegar daily
293414 i was feeling good throughout the race the pace was not so fast that i had any problems and even when the british girl made her move i was confident i have the speed to overtake her in the final part of the race i was very confident of the gold medal there was only my team mate daniela donisa who i had any worries about
293415 i didnt want to get involved in the fighting at the beginning so i went straight to the back when i realised it was slow i notched it up a little gear with 900m to go then with 700m to go i let them know i wasnt coming back unfortunately i got lactic acid in the last 100m it was a big learning curve
293416 is it good public policy put somewhat differently in light of the history of race and gender discrimination in america is the ujamaa school a worthy attempt to promote long term equality or a dangerous betrayal of the american ideal
293417 i did find it interesting that based on a justifiable skepticism in the prospect of truly integrated schools and an equally justified concern over the desperate condition of many inner city schools a slim majority of you favored the idea of a ujamaa type program
293418 from classifying any individual by race ethnicity color or national origin

293422 albania kosovo western macedonia along with its capital skopje southeastern montenegro along with its capital podgorica northern greece and southern serbia north of kosovo
293423 when i first saw this map it struck a recollection of something i had seen before
293424 it is unfortunate that misguided european politics overly and unfairly influenced by russia and greece in the early part of the twentieth century resulted in a partition of the albanian nation so that more than half the albanians in the balkans live outside the state of albania in hostile slavic regimes especially serbia and macedonia with udba in belgrade and the sigurimi in tirana collaborating to buy trick or kill those albanians with democratic aspirations it is no wonder that it has been extremely difficult for seven million albanians to organize themselves as a nation or even politically within the five jurisdictions in which they reside while there is some cooperation among political parties in certain areas and across borders true democratic independent minded albanian leadership has been lacking and this has contributed to the divisions confusion and betrayal of the albanian cause in the balkans and in america

293431 for all i know our navy was shooting at whales out there
293432 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
293433 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
293434 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
293435 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
293436 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
293437 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
293438 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means
293439 american public if you get the right incident the american public will support bang bang kiss kiss you know were into it
293440 the laboratory informed us and the head of the laboratory confirmed the bribery attempt to us
293441 the website has been under modification from day to day
293442 you can draw your own conclusions but i am not going to say anything further at this point
293443 i havent gotten in touch with anybody but i did try because like i said all the information that im finding out is like you guys newspaper calling me and telling me and me seeing the name of a drug boldenone that ive never heard of in my life and making me look like some kind of idiot

293446 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids
293447 aids epidemic is not over in america especially not in black america
293448 2006 cdc data tell us that about half of the just over 1 million americans living with are black
293449 five percent of the entire population in dc is infected thats comparable to countries like uganda or south africa
293450 aids epidemic in the u s is not getting the kind attention that it merits
293451 we understand the needs of black folk in johannesburg south africa
293452 why cant we understand the needs of them in jackson mississippi we understand the needs in nigeria or botswana why not understand the needs of los angeles or oakland
293453 increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic remained all but flat
293454 i dont really talk to many other people about it cause i guess maybe they dont want to talk
293455 herreras current state of health is grounds for suspending his sentence on humanitarian grounds
293456 it is vital that he should receive medical treatment as soon as possible we urge the cuban authorities to show some consideration towards this prisoner who is in danger of dying we point out that a total of 23 journalists are imprisoned in cuba 20 of whom were like herrera arrested during the black spring of 2003
293457 do not take revenge my friends but leave room for gods wrath for it is written

293459 people come into your life for a reason a season or a lifetime when you figure out which one it is you will know what to do for each person
293460 nothing is set in stone but do i think it is going to happen yes i think it is going to happen
293461 the happiness does not make you a better person is not true happiness
293462 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
293463 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
293464 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
293465 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
293466 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
293467 the scientific community is really going to run with this
293468 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

293471 why did you leave california for here if i lived in california id never leave
293472 it is sadder to find the past again and find it inadequate to the present than it is to have it elude you and remain forever a harmonious conception of memory
293473 the decision to resort to the use of force was a careless blunder to say the least made over cautionary advice of the u n secretariat here in new york
293474 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
293475 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
293476 unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with its subscribers internet traffic
293477 the commission concluded that comcasts network management practices discriminate among applications rather than treating all equally and are inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet indeed the commission noted that comcast has an anticompetitive motive to interfere with customers use of peer to peer applications
293478 the commission also concluded that comcasts practices are not minimally intrusive as the company claims but rather are invasive and have significant effects in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
293479 sometime before the end of the year a timetable that martin previously questioned on its initial announcement as well as also announced collaborations with content delivery experts pando networks to
293480 repeated erroneous characterizations of comcasts network management practices that we have taken great pains to clarify on multiple occasions
293481 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
293482 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
293483 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
293484 bringing gay men and women into this institution will surely change the gay subculture in subtle but profoundly conservative ways
293485 my first thought was my pregnant daughter was coming for the weekend
293486 the health risk to me and my family was probably small
293487 mah jong was still popular during the winter of 1923 24 the winter when calvin coolidge was becoming accustomed to the white house and the bok peace prize was awarded and the oil scandals broke and woodrow wilson died and general dawes went overseas to preside over the reparations conference and so big outsold all other novels and people were tiring of
293488 their promotion campaign was ingenious and proved to be prophetic for from the very beginning they advertised their book by drawing the following parallel
293489 the cross word puzzle craze gradually died down in 1925 it was followed by a minor epidemic of question and answer books there was a time when ladies and gentlemen with vague memories faced frequent humiliation after dinner because they were unable to identify john huss or tell what an ohm was not until after contract bridge was introduced in the united states in 1926 did they breathe easily despite the decline of the cross word puzzle however it remained throughout the rest of the decade a daily feature in most newspapers and simon and schuster bringing out their sixteenth series in 1930 figured their total sales since early 1924 at nearly three quarters of a million copies and the grand total including british and canadian sales at over two million
293490 governments were either bemused as were the speculators or they deemed it unwise to be sane at a time when sanity exposed one to ridicule condemnation for spoiling the game or the threat of severe political retribution
293491 darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy
293492 and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see
293493 this past off season i worked very hard and you can see it paying off coach has seen it
293494 i was running around out there with my head cut off
293495 the coaches did a great job of just giving me basic things to do they told me that it was ok and to be patient
293496 but it was good to get that experience as a rookie
293497 i forget which day it was but it was an interception he had
293498 the day before he had been beaten on that he had to learn from the day before that it was going to be some type of x isolation route so thats what he processed thats why he got the jump that he got on it and that to me is real progress
293499 he wants to go against the toughest guy all the time the toughest route all the time putting himself in those hard situations so that when he faces them in a game theyre not as hard
293500 no weve said when we went through the wildcatters scenario a few months back the county and this building are not gonna get into another situation where were subsidizing any type of tenant or sports organization in this building its a deal the building will make money on but also a fair deal for the team

293505 they are just there hundreds of them they even wave their hands and taunt militiamen guarding surrounding areas they have not occupied yet were defending our communities by ourselves using our resources
293506 this very sad development just confirms the scenario that the milf is not in control of its forces if there would be final peace agreement between the milf and the government will milf forces on the ground all adhere to such peace agreement the government peace panel should consider this concern very seriously
293507 we have been talking for 10 years or since january 1997 during the government of former president fidel ramos and this is a significant milestone in the peace process and we appreciate the leadership of president arroyo and the administration
293508 prove that there are countless members of the police force who continue to selflessly serve and protect the people in order to preserve peace and order and ultimately contribute to the task of nation building
293509 we will stop accepting any international carrier the presence of cebu pacific which transferred their international flights here today is already sufficient
293510 were happy we are already here and that the terminal is 90 percent complete its just a matter of integrating all the parts of a computerized terminal
293511 we have now reached 60 percent of the design capacity of the terminal
293512 so what well do now is concentrate on the daily operations of the terminal with all the flights of our three carriers that have transferred
293513 in the hopstock matter if the io does find reasonable grounds the case will progress to a general court martial
293514 we regularly invite publications that exert considerable influence over the tourist population to come and experience the country as a holiday attraction for the australian market we focus on how the philippines offers so much adventure while being one of their nearest destinations
293515 i was out of the country when the alleged meeting between francis de borja and justice sabio took place on july 1 i was in the united states for a medical check and returned on july 13 this is documented
293516 i categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of justice jose sabio that i was waiting in the car i do not have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except for my wife the allegation is malicious and pure fabrication
293517 i know francis de borja but i have not authorized him or anybody to make representations for any matter that involves cases of meralco and the lopez family
293518 i do not see any reason night now maybe one of these days but i do not see the urgency to talk to him
293519 i want to assure justice sabio that the lopez family has never been involved in any form violence
293520 i want to assure justice sabio that it is not the style of the lopez family weve been through several setbacks but we never resorted to such kind of dealings
293521 eu e a dupla lvaro marinho miguel nunes fomos vice campe es do mundo este ano com duas semanas de intervalo eu primeiro e eles a seguir por isso eles pediram me para ganhar uma medalha na china queremos que a hist ria se repita

293524 designed to create conditions for effective relations with tehran over the long haul
293525 w ith iran the u s government will again need to keep an eye on the long term communicating with the current government but also encouraging more discussion among iranians and more contacts and interactions between iranians and americans
293526 societies and governments change the u s government has some ability to foster favourable trends in iran but these policies will take time to come to fruition
293527 appears to be on its way to becoming a nuclear power
293528 a large majority of iranians strongly believe that iran has the same right as other nations to develop nuclear energy including the construction and operation of nuclear enrichment facilities
293529 if irans facilities were to be bombed public support for any retaliation its government took would likely be widespread
293530 strong push to retaliate as c ritics of such a policy would likely choose to keep silent
293531 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current programme without major budgetary consequences
293532 probably do more to solidify public support for the regime than weaken it
293533 iranian security forces have convincingly shown that they can handle restive ethnic groups and violent opposition to iranian rule is more likely to entrench the current security and political forces than to elicit a positive change in regime policies
293534 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
293535 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
293536 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
293537 i just heard that today but i dont know if it was a joke or whatever
293538 we really havent been doing too much talking about whos going to be wearing it i dont know yet
293539 if they put it in there they put it in there im still going to play my game im not going to pay any attention to that
293540 youre constantly having to flush the toilet after somebody im done with it
293541 this is a large and growing problem for american pastors and churches
293542 i know of a number of pastors who face a big struggle
293543 the majority of our churches are probably 100 people or less
293544 we have very few megachurches so as a result its very difficult for them to raise the revenues necessary to provide comprehensive benefits for their pastors and their laity
293545 i and my wife are stepping out in faith that god will provide for us
293546 i firmly believe that churches need to be providing comprehensive benefits for their pastors
293547 they call their pastors for their sheep to lead the flock and pastors ought not to have to worry about what might happen to them perhaps if they were hospitalized are they going to be able to continue to serve in their church
293548 the big issue is following the will of god and that requires faith
293549 i have proven throughout all my history that when i obey him he provides so this isnt any different
293550 a rate cut at the september rba meeting in little more than four weeks is certain it wont be the last and it could be half of 1 per cent
293551 until we come to terms with war as the context of our days we will not understand life we will misinterpret 90 percent of what is happing around us and to us it will be very hard to believe that gods intentions toward us are life abundant it will be even harder not to feel that somehow we are just blowing it worse we will begin to accept some really awful things about god that four year old girl being molested by her daddy that is gods will that ugly divorce that tore your family apart god wanted that to happen to and that plane crash that took the lives of so many that was desired by god
293552 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
293553 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
293554 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
293555 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
293556 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce

293559 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
293560 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
293561 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
293562 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

293564 this is a very global business and yahoo is very well positioned
293565 yahoo has a sad history of complicity with violating human rights by turning over information to the chinese government

293569 the eclipse is a natural phenomenon i know it was also said to mean bad luck for our nation in old times but i prefer to think it means the end of bad luck

293571 treating the petition for rehearing en banc as a petition for panel rehearing the petition for panel rehearing is denied
293572 the court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court and a majority of the judges who are in regular active service and not disqualified not having voted in favor the petition for rehearing en banc is denied
293573 what that means is that by my count 10 of the judges voted against the rehearing and eight voted for it
293574 the no votes would include any of the eligible judges who didnt want to take a position one way or the other theyre then automatically counted as votes not to rehear the case
293575 we are excited to be working with a well versed sales person with a proven track record and look forward to seeing him in action

293623 people are interested to know why i picked harriet miers
293624 they want to know harriet miers background they want to know as much as they possibly can before they form opinions
293625 part of it has to do with the fact that she was a pioneer woman and a trailblazer in the law in texas
293626 she recognizes however that a persons religion or personal views have no role when it comes to making decisions as a judge
293627 the only thing those guys recognize and appreciate is force
293628 i support the president i support the military and i support going after the enemies of our country
293629 whenever the president feels like he needs to call something a war to boost his poll numbers
293630 how the fuck does one declare war on an amorphous group of individuals
293631 we have no religious tests for public office in this country
293632 roberts religious faith and how he lives that faith as an individual has no bearing and no place in the confirmation process

293643 hours before ivan came ashore its outer edges spawned tornadoes blamed for the deaths of two people in panama city beach florida but it is new orleans the largest us city below sea level that is particularly vulnerable to flooding the citys emergency manager yesterday warned that as many as 50 000 people could drown if new orleans was hit by a strong category 4 storm the city has 10 000 body bags on hand in case of a catastrophe while many new orleans residents took city officials advice and left town a large group of people mostly concentrated in poorer neighborhoods didnt have a choice but to stay and hope for the best with no public transportation or evacuation plan up to 100 000 people were left stranded in the city david helvarg president of the blue frontier campaign and author of the books the war against the greens and blue frontier saving americas living seas he is also a contributor to feeling the heat reports from the frontlines of climate change mark schleifstein pulitzer prize winning environmental reporter for the new orleans times picayune he joins us on the phone from his office in new orleans where he spent the night
293644 theres going to be some minor damage in the city itself and maybe some more extensive damage south of us along the louisiana coastline on the east side of the mississippi river but for us we you know this was not the big one so to speak it did what hurricane george did in 1998 and at the last minute it moved to the east enough to spare us from catastrophic storm surge
293645 yeah mark your newspaper had a story yesterday about the advice of officials to many residents in new orleans to move out of the storms path but yet there was the problem of up to 100 000 poor new orleans who could not new orleans residents who could not evacuate because they didnt own cars could you talk about that story and what happened
293646 sure fortunately like i said things werent horrendous that became a semi non problem this time but its the elephant in the room in louisiana what is going to happen when the worst case scenario hits and there are all of these people who cannot get out there are theres talk about some grand plan for moving people to some sort of structure that was that would provide them with at least a refuge the mayor of new orleans yesterday opened up the super dome to act as that refuge and fortunately a few people took advantage of it i think there were 1 200 people who did in the two hour period that they were allowed to make that decision get to a staging area and be bussed to the superdome and allowed in when there really is a serious one i think youll see a rush of buses to get people to a variety of different structures with the explanation that this is a refuge not a shelter and there is nothing there for you you have to bring everything yourself and it is going to be a disaster engineers have gone through the city building engineers civil engineers have done a survey of the city and basically found that there are no public buildings with enough areas that would survive a catastrophic storm to actually act as refuges even in the city theres no effort yet to require new public buildings to withstand catastrophic hurricane winds
293647 mark very quickly we were just commenting at the top of this segment that theres a tremendous amount of coverage obviously on these monster hurricanes but we rather hear the words
293648 i know that in my newspaper we have quite a few stories that deal with global warming global climate change some of which are directly aimed at the concern here in louisiana we have serious concerns about changes in our climate causing significant changes in the way we live theres significant concerns about increased vectors being created by warmer and wetter weather here and you know everything from return of malaria and yellow fever to newer diseases that may be popping in to the community and of course there are our biggest problem here in louisiana is sea level rise you know i sadly the joke here is that we dont have to wait for the additional sea level rise from climate change to cause problems for us our coastline is already in drastic danger we are losing communities to sea level rise today not in 25 years or 50 years or 100 years its happening now
293649 we have been abandoned by our own country the aftermath of hurricane katrina will go down as one of the worst abandonments of americans on american soil ever in u s history

293653 but another reason this distinction is ill grasped where race is concerned may be the failure of blacks to produce on their own the sorts of goods common in white society this inability of blacks to acquire caucasoid goods without caucasoid cooperation makes white refusal to deal with blacks appear to be a barrier and a barrier is indeed harmful but refusal to offset an inability is not a barrier africans centuries ago unaware of europe were not harmed by the sheer existence of unavailable european goods nor would africans have been harmed had they known about and wanted to trade for those goods but were unable to inform europe of their desire it also follows that africans would not have been harmed had the europeans who refused to deal lived on the same continent or shared the same territory as do blacks and whites in the united states the proximity of someone with goods you do not have may sharpen your desire for them but his refusal to slake your desire does not make you worse off
293654 the case appears otherwise for blacks who are more inclined than whites to regard public assistance as a legitimate means of support one implication is that welfare would be unstable in an all black population and another may be that welfare for blacks at 12 of the population will eventually bankrupt an otherwise prosperous white society it thus may be imprudent to offer blacks the same safety net that whites make available to each other
293655 out out damn spot and a pox on both your houses your off white house and your majority ruling house of cards
293656 the national socialist world view is the volkish political doctrine which determines and forms the german man and as such it is also binding upon german christians the evangelical lutheran church honors a divinely established order in the state and demands from its members a total service in this order the national socialist philosophy fights relentlessly against the political and intellectual influence of the jewish race on the life of our volk in obedience to the divine order of creation the evangelical lutheran church affirms its responsibility to preserve the purity of our volkdom beyond that in the realm of faith there is no sharper contrast than that between the message of christ and the jewish religion with its sterile legalism and its hope for a political messiah
293657 the triumph and the will of the evangelical bush administration affirms its responsibility to preserve the purity of our volkdom
293658 life itself is essentially appropriation injury overpowering of the strange and weaker suppression severity imposition of ones own forms incorporation and at the least and mildest exploitation
293659 fukuyama qualifies as the official ideologue of the bush regime

293661 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of postwar history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankind ideological evolution
293662 in general the world is a rational place in which the winners on the whole deserve to win and losers deserve to loose it is only for the exception the lives that are strikingly unfair that we maintain the mediating devices of social welfare

293664 our topic is the poor and the discriminated against as they have been affected by
293665 the very existence of a welfare system was undermining the moral character of the people not working was easier than working not saving is easier than saving shirking responsibility for parents and spouses and children is easier than taking responsibility
293666 a welfare system was perpetually in danger of tilting the balance in favor of the easy way out

293711 g a ve british prime minister gordon brown some management advice over the weekend
293712 this column incorrectly said that sen barack obama shared his views on how to avoid micromanagement with british prime minister gordon brown last saturday obama shared those views with british opposition leader david cameron
293713 inside according to a witness he told the house members this is the moment
293714 milbank cited the quote in support of his thesis that obama was becoming a
293715 suggest ed that obama was beginning to believe his own hype
293716 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that obama was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
293717 house democratic aides getting up thursday morning and decid ing that the quotes looked bad
293718 i do wonder whether or not echoing a misquote is really your best starting point
293719 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
293720 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
293721 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
293722 the enthusiasm is not about me at all milbank cited a comment that means nearly the opposite of the interpretation milbank gave it if the leadership aides version is accurate
293723 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
293724 it should be noted if it hasnt already that nobody is questioning the accuracy of the obama quotes only the context
293725 his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
293726 it basically means there wasnt enough evidence to decide what caused the fire
293727 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
293728 fable ii is finished all that innovation and drama has come together and weve finished it
293729 weve got this dynamic landscape that changes that means you want to invite people in

293738 senate passage of this compact will help us protect the great lakes from water diversions and preserve this invaluable resource for future generations
293739 by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
293740 will protect the health of these precious bodies of freshwater preventing unnecessary and dangerous diversions of great lakes waters i know the people of wisconsin feel strongly about the importance of preserving the lakes for future generations
293741 would preserve and protect one of our national treasures for us and future generations
293742 its time to seal the deal and protect our lakes our drinking water our economy and our way of life
293743 college athletics particularly in the pac 10 is incredibly competitive great facilities are necessary to stay in the game we cant let the uw gain an unfair advantage by pilfering millions of our state tax dollars to build an even grander monument to athletic ineptitude on lake washington the state has better things to do with our money

293747 martins young and doesnt speak english very well so i think i can get him to do it
293748 naturally we came to the only logical conclusion anyone could make in such a situation
293749 matt and heath were identical twins who needed to be reunited
293750 i was so certain god didnt exist but this has completely altered my outlook
293751 excessive absenteeism and a lack of engagement could be a problem particularly as the olympics will be going on during office hours
293752 we estimate that the olympics could cost britain up to 600 000 in lost productivity
293753 people spend more during big sporting events the world cup added around 1bn to the economy
293754 we are going to see much more digital consumption of these olympics with people using pdas and mobiles to get their olympic updates
293755 the way we consume news has changed and what we are likely to see is employees getting a quick sporting fix in bite sized chunks and then getting on with their work
293756 we want people to connect with what is happening on the other side of the world if we lose employees attention for the 10 seconds of the 100m i dont think we have to be too worried
293757 organisations need to be aware that this type of event generates a huge amount of interest and they need to be flexible but firm
293758 there is no need to be a spoilsport but staff may need to be reminded that they still have contractual requirements and if they are switching off it may be their colleagues who have to shoulder the burden
293759 the chinese community is extremely excited about the olympics there has been a lot of bad press but this really is the first chance for our mother country to show the world what it can do
293760 this is something we have wanted to do for a very long time mainly because major retailers come to us and want to be part of coolsprings galleria and we have not had space for them said mall
293761 the district at coolsprings galleria will feature smaller anchors than those that exist at the current mall such as macys and dillards
293762 the expansion will introduce a targeted selection of junior anchors an array of high fashion boutiques and quality sit down restaurants in a luxurious outdoor atmosphere the mall said in a press release
293763 the district at coolsprings galleria will feature an open air streetscape setting with unique and eye catching storefronts attractive architectural elements extensive landscaping and pedestrian friendly walkways
293764 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
293765 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
293766 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
293767 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
293768 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
293769 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
293770 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
293771 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
293772 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
293773 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
293774 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
293775 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
293776 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
293777 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
293778 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
293779 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
293780 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
293781 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
293782 hamlet 2 doesnt everyone die at the end of the first one
293783 im not going to be the vice presidential nominee or vice president im going to help sen mccain get elected as governor of louisiana let me be clear i have said in every private and public conversation ive got the job that i want

293804 many churches feel that when something needs to be done they must hire someone to do it
293805 we are to love them minister to them and witness to them of his love
293806 but once they begin serving they fall in love with the people themselves and this motivates further service
293807 koinonia is a deep sense of belonging to one another
293808 if gods people are to witness and minis ter to a lost and hurting world
293809 koi nonia must be the sustaining context in which they find their strength and will to do so
293810 jesus was concerned for whole persons body mind and spirit
293811 what ever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
293812 gave rise to churches that practiced social ministries without addressing the spiritual need for forgiveness of sin and recon ciliation with god
293813 the social gospel divorced from per sonal salvation is like a body without a soul the message of personal salvation without a social dimension is like a soul without a body the former is a corpse the latter is a ghost
293814 since then i never felt i was worthy of any bodys love
293815 before i came to this ministry i felt i was not worthy even of my own mothers love but now i feel worthy of gods love and that makes me able to love others for the first time
293816 private faith big government understanding the impact of marginalizing religion
293817 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high
293818 we want the sovereignty that we hold over amazonian territory and the decisions that are made in this region to be respected
293819 the fund is a vehicle by which foreign governments can help support our initiatives without exerting any influence over our national policy
293820 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame
293821 thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
293822 we are committed to reducing the destruction of the rainforest to eliminating illegal burning and to guaranteeing a better quality of life for all
293823 perch in effetti io sono qua che cerco di convertirli a un maggiore apporto vitaminico nella loro alimentazione e stavo appunto pulendo fagiolini quando mi arrivata sta furia
293824 tu hai perso il contatto con la quotidianit di qua e in italia hai visto solo quella manica di pazzi che sono i convertiti
293825 non ha nessun senso mollare lislam bisogna difendere quello che omar chiama
293826 ok ti chiedi cosa fa s che lislam ci prenda come nessuna altra religione saprebbe fare
293827 forcing multiple vehicles to stop abruptly or change their direction to avoid hitting the defendant
293828 clearly shows long trying to dodge pogan who appears to have remained upright the entire time
293829 the police officer looked to see who he was going to pick off
293830 all of a sudden the cop picked this kid out and bodychecked him i couldnt believe what was going on
293831 these guys were the biggest h raisers in my high school class
293832 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
293833 will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
293834 we are hopeful that this return will be sooner rather than later
293835 the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck
293836 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
293837 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
293838 if the dodgers start to lose and they are out of it before august 31 they could put manny on waivers depending what the dodgers want for him we could have manny for the stretch drive in september with the bosox paying him
293839 1 abreu jeter cano and melky are having down years 2 a rod and giambi are struggling to hit with risp
293840 i thought girardi shouldve got himself thrown out after that awful call at home last night
293841 super important stats bay is hitting 421 lifetime 8 19 against andy pettitte 429 3 7 against mike mussina and 500 1 2 against joba chamberlain
293842 i rod is hitting 500 vs buchholz 1 2 667 vs delcarmen 2 3 333 vs okijima 1 3 333 vs papelbon 2 6 298 vs wakefield 14 47 he has never faced beckett in his career surprisingly and is 0 2 vs lester pudge also is a 385 career hitter vs halladay and a 333 career hitter vs brunett hits 385 vs daniel cabrera too
293843 not too many players leave there happy dating back to mike greenwell roger clemens nomar garciaparra and on and on
293844 like i said earlier we will see were all the boston love is on varitek this off season
293845 he strikes out more than the average hitter averaging 153 whiffs over a 162 game season he is on pace for 130 this season he averages 84 walks per 162 games with a high of 102 in 2006
293846 am i foolish to think rasner can outduel lackey on sunday afternoon
293847 those type of pitchers are likely to clear waivers and be available in august
293848 the competition in the al boston tampa bay los angeles is not looking for no 5 starter types
293849 after looking at that uninspiring list of names im all for throwing the hopefully rejuvenated ipk and someone like aceves out there and see what happens
293850 the future has to start sometime i think rasner has pitched well enough this season to leave in the rotation for now id put kennedy in to see how he does if he tanks again you go to hughes in september to see how he does
293851 the yankees would have priority over those teams anyway on a waiver claim
293852 the bonds point is apt great hitters are great hitters no matter whos around them and ortiz supporting cast will still be far better than what most teams run out there
293853 and does this kill any possibility of manny leaving boston
293854 they are not major league ready get it through your heads generation trey might be nice for a t shirt but it didnt work out
293855 what hughes and kennedy did last year has no bearing there is zero evidence this season that shows they will be as effective as they were especially in ipks case since the league has now seen him
293856 called this one wrong so i have to cover my butt
293857 if theres any doubt and guys arent sure i think they should be playing
293858 you can be retired for the rest of your life youll know when youre done
293859 if youre not 100 per cent certain that you dont want to play anymore then the decision is that you should be playing
293860 broken trying to find my way trying to find the faith thats gone
293861 if i run to you will you hold me in your arms forevermore
293862 tell me slow down if you know that im going too fast for my own good
293863 it is not a small incremental step this is a whole other ballgame with this radar
293864 it is just a much more lethal and much more survivable platform
293865 non appropriated facilities that have achieved the highest level of excellence
293866 we all have an unbridled passion that those who have been severely injured valiantly serving our nation be provided every possible tool which will allow them to pursue their dreams
293867 we have just recently awarded 64 segways in april and may and hope to be able to raise the necessary funding to present an additional 135 segways prior to the end of 2008
293868 obviously the present condition of the economy makes this effort ever more challenging but it is one we will pursue vigorously
293869 we of course could not do this without the support of the american people who are giving us the privilege of serving the great men and women of the united states military and who join with us as we witness and rejoice in the improvement of every single recipient that we have awarded
293870 in that six months i will not sleep easily on the weekends until i get up in the morning and look at the blotter reports and see ok are my troops doing as i expect them to do out there or not
293871 maybe a few soldiers will misbehave but it wont be serious i think most of them know how to control themselves
293872 this is great news for us it should have been eased far earlier
293873 please go explore dont be afraid to park your car and just walk around
293874 i spent the first six months avoiding off base but came to find i liked it a lot better than on base you dont get to learn about japan if you dont go off base
293875 every now and then we get newcomers who say i dont really want to be part of the japanese society
293876 i think its all about what you make of it
293877 we teach them basic german phrases that they might use when going to a restaurant or buying a train ticket
293878 the germans a lot of them speak english so they understand you
293879 a lot of them that ive talked to said that they are afraid of getting lost
293880 i am pushing hard to say that is where i want investments made because you come back with a whole new feeling of what its like to be in japan
293881 once you work all day you have to have a way to relax its good to be comfortable in the environment that youre in
293882 i pretty much stay local because i dont speak the language
293883 its very intimidating you dont want to make anyone uncomfortable and you dont want to be uncomfortable
293884 you get on a bus and you dont want to spend three hours in traffic
293885 i think theyre afraid of interacting just afraid of not getting their thoughts out
293886 literally thats the fear of the marketplace but it can be described as the fear of leaving a safe place
293887 often leads to believing those activities would be harder than they are and a loss of confidence in our abilities to handle them
293888 challenging oneself to take on tasks that scare us a little can lead to a big improvement in energy and confidence almost like an antidepressant
293889 i only really go off base when the kids i work with go on trips
293890 a lot of people say theyre scared to drive off base because they dont want to get lost
293891 many japanese understand english everybody studies english almost six years but they dont have a chance for conversation if you speak slowly we understand
293892 once every six months usually when the parents come to visit

293895 invito il commissario di governo per la sanit del lazio piero marrazzo a procedere secondo la necessaria coerenza con quanto stato evidenziato dal tavolo tecnico composto dai rappresentati del ministero delleconomia e del ministero del lavoro della salute e delle politiche sociali
293896 singolare supporre pregiudizi in questo tavolo tecnico i cui componenti sono gli stessi dirigenti ministeriali ai quali il ministro delleconomia padoa schioppa e il presidente del consiglio prodi si sono rivolti nel momento in cui hanno avviato la procedura di commissariamento perfezionata poi da questo consiglio dei ministri aggiunge il ministro

293899 it doesnt seem to occur to obama that the oil companies would pass the windfall profits tax on to consumers what a great plan you get relief from 4 a gallon gas and the only downside is 5 or 6 a gallon gas
293900 we just came from the go team and it was really cool
293901 i like to hear everything the headliners get people out but the other side is coming out and checking out new stuff
293902 we mainly made the trip for rage against the machine
293903 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
293904 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
293905 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
293906 those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes
293907 we are slav macedonians thats who we are we have no connection to alexander the greek and his macedonia
293908 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
293909 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
293910 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
293911 on balance a weak set of results but not as bad as headlines suggest
293912 according to the national enquirer john edwards was caught leaving his girlfriends hotel room at the beverly hilton at 2 am in the morning if this story turns out to be true there goes his chance of becoming vice president though he could still be governor of new york
293913 while barack obama was campaigning in germany he spoke to a half million people in germany a half million people and while he was doing that john mccain he wasnt laying around no no john mccain was out driving in his driveway and he backed over the mailbox
293914 demeaning obama is not why this is a dick move by mccain
293915 theres a lot of what they call buzz going around in the blogosphere right now that barack obama will choose the governor of virginia this guy tim kaine to be his running mate
293916 insiders say hillary was never on obamas vp list obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket bad enough to worry about jesse cutting them off didnt want to worry about hillary breaking them too you know what im saying
293917 barack obama says that next month hes planning on spending a week on vacation in hawaii when he heard this president bush said pace yourself because once you become president the
293918 and according to the tv show extra former vice president dan quayle remember him hes in the running to join the cast of dancing with the stars thats true dan quayle you remember he was vice president under the first george bush see that was back in the day when the president was smart and the vice president was an idiot now of course everythings turned around
293919 im not the only one who noticed the press bias against john mccain so has john mccain last week his campaign sent an e mail to reporters saying its pretty obvious that the media has a bizarre fascination with barack obama some may even say its a love affair this has got to be hard on mccain it is tough seeing your old flame with someone new john mccain and the media had a very hot fling back in the summer of 2000 they even had cute little nicknames for each other the press called mccain maverick and mccain called the press any time he wanted favorable coverage
293920 beijing skies are so polluted that chinese authorities are planning emergency measures for the olympics for example protesters will now only be run over with hybrid tanks
293921 nation ive got great news i am furious today alaska senator ted stevens was unfairly indicted by the justice department just because the oilfield company veco didnt charge him for an extensive renovation on his house including a brand new first floor a fully finished basement a wrap around deck and one assumes installing the latest internet tubes on screen stevens talking about the internet not being a big truck but a series of tubes the justice department is calling this a conflict of interest please veco is a major oil drilling company and senator stevens worked tirelessly to allow drilling in anwr thats not a conflict of interest their interests line up perfectly this is a non story folks and i look forward to stevens being proven innocent when president bush commutes his sentence
293922 then this morning the senator paid a visit to the western wall one of the holiest sites in judaism where he followed the custom of putting a message into one of the walls crevices its typically a prayer god through my connections i managed to get a hold of obamas prayer it reads dear god please protect my nuts from jesse jackson gotta make sure this gets back in that wall note to self put back in wall
293923 it does theoretically fit until you bolt on the head

293926 six people have been killed and seven have been wounded
293927 a mortar platoon of the georgian defence ministry is purposefully shelling the southern part of tskhinvali the northern outskirts of the city are being fired upon as well
293928 our response to tbilisis aggressive actions will be very tough and hard hitting
293929 we reserve the right to strike georgian cities we have something that can reach them
293930 the ossetians opened fire including with grenade launchers and the georgian side only returned fire
293931 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
293932 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

293953 pitch it into the corner and then put in all of the opposite lock you got
293954 it certainly doesnt help to have this sort of data under seal
293955 transfer pricing by multinational enterprises can pose challenges for irs and u s regulators
293956 because multinational operations and transactions can be quite complex and pricing methods may be inexact evaluating the appropriateness of particular transfer prices can be difficult
293957 facts that represent the potential crown jewels of the company
293958 where youve got people providing their valuation of assets and comparing them with other assets to reach a fair market value thats where you get real sensitivity
293959 in a lot of these cases for the property in question there really is no market benchmark
293960 converting people not only spiritually but intellectually as well and the church malik observes is lagging dangerously behind with respect to this second task
293961 is to help turn the contemporary intellectual tide in such a way as to foster a sociocultural milieu in which christian faith can be regarded as an intellectually credible option for thinking men and women
293962 philosophy can help to extend biblical teaching to areas not explicitly mentioned in scripture it can enhance the self image of the believing community and it can aid in the task of integrating theology with other disciplines in forming a christian worldview
293963 the correspondence theory of truth seems to be an important part of a biblical understanding of truth
293964 nature of being or reality and the ultimate categories or kinds of things that are real 173 the notion of
293965 some theists maintain that theism is not incompatible with gratuitous evil in the first place that god in order to achieve his ends may have to permit evils which in themselves are gratuitous
293966 he god will wipe away every tear from their eyes and there will no longer be any death there will be no longer be any mourning or crying or pain the first things have passed away
293967 in the future being a developer on someones platform will mean being hosted on their infrastructure
293968 churlish and unlike mccain and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election
293969 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
293970 attacking too much and indiscriminately the barrage undermines his brand takes time away from telling voters what he might do for them and looks awfully old timey in a year when voters want a new brand
293971 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
293972 commercial marinades offer spices and herbs which have antioxidants that help decrease the hcas formed during grilling
293973 the results from our study have a direct application since more consumers are interested in healthier cooking
293974 it is extraordinary that a whole nation be targeted for the promotion of a code of conduct
293975 it sheds light on the importance that other nations place on good manners and civility here we have a developing nation that wants to put its best face forward in an international arena in order to be accepted as a full partner in the world
293976 as a result of this study we have opened a free standing patient centered facility in a more convenient location designed specifically for our screening mammography patients
293977 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
293978 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
293979 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
293980 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
293981 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
293982 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications
293983 we are in a period that feels a lot like 1991 and 1992 and we had similar issues with a recession at that point in time high oil prices and fear of oil supply shortages
293984 for the next several months and i would say for the next year the credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take centre stage
293985 the marketplace is changing rapidly and automakers that are more flexible in their production will fare better

293993 eu e a dupla lvaro marinho miguel nunes fomos vice campe es do mundo este ano com duas semanas de intervalo eu primeiro e eles a seguir por isso eles pediram me para ganhar uma medalha na china queremos que a hist ria se repita

293996 evidently someone went online and saw that i had been making contributions to obama
293997 unless y ou are willing to recant that and swear allegiance to the party nominee john mccain we are compelled to request your resignation from the republican committee
293998 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important
293999 i talked to him last night china time about a misunderstanding on the report
294000 its better when we have a chance to sit down and talk face to face
294001 before training camp before the season we have a lot of time i think we can be good friends
294002 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
294003 if something i said would make ron feel uncomfortable i apologize
294004 im really sorry about that because i still dont know him very well still by the time we stay together obviously i will fix it
294005 right now the rockets made a good trade for us and we got a good player
294006 hes not in a good enough state to take his place in the team
294007 he can make some decisions about his lifestyle and some of his off field things to sort them out
294008 hes had two weeks to sort it out and he hasnt sorted it out yet
294009 if he does there could be a future if he doesnt hell stay exactly where he is now
294010 as a professional footballer you have obligations to your team mates first and foremost he needs to recognise those then he needs to sort them out
294011 if he does there could be a future if he doesnt hell stay exactly where he is now for the next two and a half years on the sidelines and he wont play
294012 the purpose of the meeting is because it is a week since the announcement about redundancies was made and we need to explain the current position
294013 it will also be for the elected members to explain what they have been doing
294014 i dont want to offer false hope to anybody but there is probably about a 30 chance of the mill being bought
294015 they are telling me theyd been led to believe they didnt have any choice about who they can treat
294016 some managers are interpreting the rules too restrictively and are saying unless someone is at deaths door you shouldnt treat them unless they pay
294017 three of my clients including a child have died after treatment was refused
294018 well never know whether they would have died anyway or not but they werent given the chance to survive
294019 ich laufe die 100 meter in knapp 9 6 sekunden
294020 it is so important that people understand that by removing this equipment they are putting someones life in danger
294021 the water can be so cold and thats what people arent aware of
294022 it needs to be a quick response to get them out so something like this will hopefully alert the police straight away to either someone in danger in the river or misuse of the equipment
294023 we win both ways with this excellent innovation which will allow us to be quickly alerted to people in difficulty or those breaking the law
294024 unfortunately vital life saving equipment has been damaged previously any vandalism by its very nature is mindless but where it could impact on safety it is despicable
294025 guidebooks help but most of our bookings come through internet listings on websites like hostelworld com
294026 what we get are stopovers they are either going to or from australia singapore and bangkok and they take in kl for an average of three to four days
294027 there still are pimps and all that but they dont cause problems for the rest of us the real trouble is drug addicts when we first started they were occupying all the abandoned houses here in fact the restaurant next door is a godsend as it has displaced the addicts but theyre still around the jaga keretas illegal carpark attendants who extort money from those who park here and if they cant get enough for their fix they will resort to stealing
294028 i prefer to have the dogs as they will let you know if there are strangers in the night
294029 i got into this after practising law and then working in advertising because this is what i really like
294030 we actually do get guests who arrive in suits and i have to ask you do realise this is a budget hostel right
294031 these were all homes and we set up shop here on the five foot way where im standing now was a drain but dbkl built an additional brick sidewalk
294032 come at 5am and see if i have business or not
294033 he doesnt use any chemicals or whatever and the fruit only comes according to the season
294034 we budget hotels help each other out but some of the big players with a lot of money have been opening three or four hostels and paying very high rental theyre spoiling the market
294035 men seem to feel the need to tell me that a lot
294036 i get great tits all the time but thats not the way to get into my pants get me interested in you take your time i promise you itll be worth it besides we have all night
294037 but even there i want you to take your time go down on my pussy and stay there until i cum
294038 i think they came to the national because they knew everybody would be here all under one roof its like shooting ducks in a barrel
294039 an unregulated business like this it brings in a lot of unscrupulous people this needed to be done a long time ago
294040 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
294041 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
294042 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas
294043 im not going to be surprised one day that franklin breaks that record for the number of goals kicked in one game
294044 that would never surprise me you cant give him an opportunity
294045 if its not him kicking goals its fellow forward jarryd roughead
294046 our last couple of weeks have been pretty disappointing and it was just good to bounce back
294047 i can with assurance say that before the closing ceremony on august 24 all events will be finished
294048 the contingency plan for the marathon is there we might have a different schedule in case of pollution but that will be before the closing ceremony
294049 im relaxed im driving good i have a good car and things are running smoothly
294050 its not a question of confidence because ive never been one to lack confidence its more like a rhythm you pick up and a feeling of comfort with the car
294051 its very responsive right now and if i need something like more traction or something then i know where to go for it by making just one set up change rather than chasing down different alleys
294052 its friday though and friday is nothing its just a day where we all warm up saturday is when we show our true face and sunday is when we do the job
294053 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
294054 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
294055 i have three years left on my contract so im very happy being part of this family

294071 most of the assets of the church of england in terms of buildings schools and other property either come from the pre reformation catholic church or as a direct result of the tractarian and catholic revival
294072 this property is very much our heritage and inheritance and to suggest that many wish to steal it from us in a very unpleasant form of legalised theft would not be an understatement
294073 i do wonder if this would stand in the european court
294074 it is quite apparent that we are being subjected to what i would call institutional bullying of a kind that if it were found in the commercial world would be the subject of serious litigation

294194 i confirm our ambition is to be a major actor in the nuclear renaissance in the uk
294195 our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal british energy still has potential sites and sites are available from the nuclear decommissioning authority
294196 time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
294197 new nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the governments energy strategy but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control
294198 recognised the right of the scottish people to decide their constitutional future
294199 mr salmond has to act in a responsible manner when he brings forward his ideas on that because at the moment we dont have the detail we dont have any guarantee that its a neverendum
294200 he alex salmond has also got his own credit crunch coming along
294201 it is coming in terms of the financing of this country
294202 i will be a bold scottish leader my fellow scots ill focus my energies on making your hopes and your ambitions reality i will fear no one and i will do whatever it takes to deliver these promises
294203 we scottish labour face a hell of a challenge we all know where weve been we all know things have gone wrong but from this point on its about the future we have an opportunity to work together to win again it is an opportunity i am ready to seize
294204 i believe that your background should not have to determine your future
294205 id like to see a substantial expansion in student bursaries the snps abolition of the graduate endowment will not help talented bright young people from less affluent backgrounds get into university in the first place
294206 i want to rebuild the party but i want to do that with a view to getting the message across to people in parts of scotland particularly where we have for whatever reason lost contact with them
294207 alex salmond has got his day of reckoning as first minister
294208 it is important that as liberal democrats we have our own distinctive brand and policies

294210 for heavens sake lets get serious of course we can win with gordon as our leader
294211 there will be joint action between the unions commencing with an all out strike on wednesday 20 august this is due to the employers failure to properly address the issue of low pay within scottish local government
294212 there is a bigger issue here some of our members get only 8p more than the minimum wage and this needs to be dealt with
294213 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
294214 inflation is at 4 6 per cent and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster by as much as 14 per cent just this week gas prices went up 35 per cent
294215 our members need a fair offer from their employers we have a window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes i hope the employers take it
294216 i believe that our current differences are best resolved through negotiation and i and the employers negotiating team are always available for constructive discussion that takes us towards a mutually agreed solution

294224 all i can say is searching for the word cuil fails to return itself as a result impressive
294225 i tried it for an hour any multi word search generated completely useless results
294226 dont worry about whether cuil is good or not in a short period of time the founders will become instant millionaires when microsoft buys them out
294227 ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
294228 im not too worried about them running out of cash
294229 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
294230 its just a question of how severe the downturn is and how extended it is and obviously how successful the new models are that theyre looking to launch
294231 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time

294252 many of my clients are women who have recently come out of long term relationships
294253 unsurprisingly they are insecure about taking the plunge again others are young men who dont know where to start but the common factor is usually a simple lack of confidence funnily enough most are successful business professionals but they fall apart socially yet the skills that guarantee them success at work decisiveness and communicating confidently are exactly those needed for dating and are actually transferable
294254 too many men think theyre brad pitt in search of a jennifer aniston but what i see opposite me is sometimes more like johnny vegas so a few home truths may be necessary but once you accept your limitations we can work around them
294255 to begin with why not just go over and say hi youd be amazed how many people dont take that simple initiative and exude confidence even if youre faking it
294256 this accounts for 55 per cent of social interaction but many people men especially cant read the signals or unconsciously transmit negative ones i teach people to interpret body language and be aware of their own so they can learn to modify it

294262 b is a base level of fame that we identified and quantified by analysing the average level of fame in the year before peak
294263 for george clooney b would be a large number but for a fabulous nobody like a new big brother contestant b is zero p is the increment of fame above the base level
294264 this formula fits the data remarkably well giving a precise numerical value to the 15 month theory if i put in t 5 corresponding to 15 months after the peak it gives f b p 1 50 1 50 which works out at f b 04p in other words up to 96 of the fame boost achieved at the peak of public attention has been frittered away
294265 putting t 0 into the equation gives an infinite fame peak not mathematically accurate perhaps but the concept of the level of fame being off the radar is apposite
294266 my only excuse being that i was but a youth and had to be in town at that time for other reasons i remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain and how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half round and back

294289 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability
294290 make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
294291 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

294403 if it looks like its going to be a long term issue and the need arises then i think the need to convert some of that shell space will come a lot quicker its always in the back of everybodys mind that this going to be something that were going to have to do some day

294412 along with fewer vehicles we want motorists to be aware that driving safely is the best way to keep motor fatalities down

294421 we cant judge montreal by the first and second years
294422 weve really got to judge this race by its fourth and fifth year because what seems to be happening is every time we do an international deal it loses its luster it starts way up because everyone is real excited then it goes down down down
294423 we tried japan and mexico so maybe the third times the charm theres really no difference between running watkins glen or montreal its just a couple of miles farther up here even though its international it doesnt feel like it

294425 i was amazed to find that the book wasnt just comprised of arists and their work it was something much more looking at any of the pages in the tribute you can tell the artist enjoyed and had fun with what they did the artists love of the game was in these pages not just their talent and i realized this that is when i had decided to start collecting as many signatures as i could not because i just wanted their signature but to also let the artist know that their work here was appreciated

294430 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
294431 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
294432 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
294433 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that
294434 the nice thing here is that there are some very long straights where you can drop down and pass
294435 coming through the first 15 20 guys will be easy then it will get harder the closer you come to the front
294436 this is the most difficult track that i race without a doubt its technical its very high speed the turns are very slow you get in there at 170 mph and then youre right back down to 40 mph on the turns

294487 outside of housing and autos its not all that bad
294488 consumers despite all the griping about high oil prices and despite the lack of confidence theyre still out there spending their little hearts out
294489 theyre not going down anywhere near as fast as they normally do in a recession
294490 so if were in a recession were in one thats not having the kind of cumulative downward tendencies that we normally do
294491 this is the first time i really had more control
294492 everything in here is new most of the other albums have been a few new songs and then back to the older stuff or the covers which is fine but you gotta be creative i would talk to jimi hendrix and eric clapton and jeff beck when they were all making records and they would tell me that they would go in the studio with the freedom to play what they wanted this time i had that
294493 i used to play with this boy ride horses down close to where i was born
294494 then when we were 13 his parents made us stop
294495 are the two that are most overtly biographical and introspective
294496 this is the first time i really had more control
294497 everything in here is new most of the other albums have been a few new songs and then back to the older stuff or the covers which is fine but you gotta be creative i would talk to jimi hendrix and eric clapton and jeff beck when they were all making records and they would tell me that they would go in the studio with the freedom to play what they wanted this time i had that
294498 the first time i met the blues i was walking through the woods
294499 i was born in the woods thats the facts of life
294500 i used to play with this boy ride horses down close to where i was born
294501 then when we were 13 his parents made us stop
294502 most musicians were still sitting down in front of music stands even if they couldnt read music they did it just to look more serious then guitar slim got wild and kicked them all off stage and i was wild like that too
294503 we used to have guitar battles every sunday and monday with guys like otis rush and magic sam
294504 it was like watching two tennis players or two boxers theyd go at each other but it was just making a living one time i came in with a 150 foot cord walked in the door playing and they just put their guitars down and even now if i dont go off the stage people ask if im feeling alright
294505 buddy guy a young blues singer in his own right was first choice and it is amazing for so young a musician as buddy to be able to fit in with muddy
294506 he was for me what elvis was probably like for other people
294507 i just try to get the best players and hope i can pop the top off this can and show that the blues are back
294508 i learn from them bring them in and see what they can do and these guys got me feeling like when i was 22 years old and went into the studio with muddy waters
294509 if you get too old to learn you might as well go out of this world backwards
294510 its like being a prizefighter if you lay down you never have a chance to win but if you keep punching you might hit em with the one that lays em down

294526 dr sokol what do you think about the case of ashley x the disabled girl whose parents stunted her growth to care for her more easily
294527 what are your thoughts on ms a the teenage girl who told her doctor that she was abused by her father but begged the doctor to keep her secret
294528 should the parents of this severely disabled baby be allowed to insist on life sustaining treatment even if doctors think its futile
294529 tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
294530 we are interested in the nature and extent to which you engage in such practices and the impact it could have on consumer privacy
294531 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
294532 we offer great values for guess who enter our world class and enjoy up to 16 hours a day of fun including attractions parade and other entertaining spectaculars
294533 we periodically analyze our pricing to make sure it reflects the entertainment value and quality that we deliver to our guests
294534 well it starts with the fact that we have a product that is very very attractive clearly and weve felt for a long time that the family vacation is still something thats considered quite valuable or significant not just to domestic families but to international families and i think we have a competitive advantage as well in that the experience that you can expect to have when you visit a disney park is unlike any that youd experience elsewhere and in some cases unlike anything youd experience in the entire vacation space
294535 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
294536 it is so important that people understand that by removing this equipment they are putting someones life in danger
294537 the water can be so cold and thats what people arent aware of
294538 it needs to be a quick response to get them out so something like this will hopefully alert the police straight away to either someone in danger in the river or misuse of the equipment
294539 we win both ways with this excellent innovation which will allow us to be quickly alerted to people in difficulty or those breaking the law
294540 unfortunately vital life saving equipment has been damaged previously any vandalism by its very nature is mindless but where it could impact on safety it is despicable
294541 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
294542 there was a dozen ideas proffered how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why don t we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes through the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you can t have americans killing americans but that s the kind of that s the level of stuff we are talking about provocation but that was rejected
294543 we now brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge the last of these surge brigades returned home this month and later this year general petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
294544 mr karadzic you are charged with one count of genocide under article 4 of the statute of the international tribunal with one count of complicity in genocide under article 4 of the statute with five counts of crimes against humanity under article 5 of the statute and with four counts of war crimes under articles 2 and 3 of the statute
294545 i have to say this is a question of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no capital punishment i am wondering if his arm is long enough to reach me even here
294546 the current food crisis which is true in many many countries and the poorer you are the more affected you are by that is affecting also the fight against aids and we have the paradoxical situation that some people have access to pretty expensive and sophisticated drugs but have no food to eat nothing to eat or dont have the money to take the bus to go to the medical center and have no job
294547 through this analysis we also hope to be able to answer a question that goes beyond just finding water ice but is this a habitable zone on mars habitable zone meaning that we have periodic liquid water not today but over time and we have the materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms it will be for a future mission to find if anybodys home in this environment

294556 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
294557 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
294558 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
294559 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
294560 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
294561 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

294588 these may look like common objects to you but to us they could be weapons or they could be used to make weapons or to ship weapons or to store weapons because only an expert can see they might be weapons and only an expert can deal with weapons cause only an expert can deal with the problem and only an expert can deal with the problem that only an expert can deal with the problem

294590 well im old enough to remember my grandparents talking about the fall and the great depression of 1929 so i was concerned about the bank totally closing not being able to get the money that was the main concern because my wife and i are both retirees and this is you know savings that we depend on monthly
294591 i cant move my arms i requested medical care a long time ago you havent done anything about it
294592 no i mean they look theyre healing well to me you know im not a doctor but i think youre getting good medical care
294593 no im not youre not here i lost my eyes i lost my feet everything
294594 no you still have your eyes and your feet are still at the end of your legs you know
294595 now we know who martyred our two sisters we know who martyred the people of deh rawod and we know who martyred the people in kabul now this has become clear and we have told the government of pakistan that the killings of people in afghanistan the destruction of bridges in afghanistan are carried out by pakistans intelligence and pakistans military departments
294596 the bush oil policy is an attempt at mass deception by a white house that has for the last seven and a half years pursued big oils agenda of drill drill drill
294597 i just submitted an application requesting to the pre trial chamber number three to issue an arrest warrant against omar hassan ahmad al bashir for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
294598 lets not be naive its not going to happen in the next couple of days thats clear to us but its not the first time that a head of state sitting head of state has been indicted you will remember the examples of slobodan milosevic in 99 or taylor in 2001 who was also the sitting president of liberia at the time they were not arrested immediately but eventually when the international community threw its weight behind these arrest warrants
294599 to have the federal government disappear your marriage im sure will be painful and upsetting it really is something out of orwell its shameful

294606 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
294607 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
294608 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes
294609 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone
294610 i would rather speak at a rally or a gathering any place outside the united states after i am president of the united states but thats a judgment that senator obama and the american people will make
294611 i feel like justice has been served and in all truth this war criminal the oppressor known as luciano benjamin menendez is going to rot in jail which is exactly what he deserves
294612 the bottom line here is that weve shifted money to help the democratically elected government of pakistan to fight a common foe a common enemy that we have we believe that these upgrades that had already been approved will help the pakistanis us it will help the pakistanis help us fight this common foe and that we believe that this is a positive way to help a friend
294613 we consider this day as a black day in the history of iraqi sport it is a black day as it terminates all the aspirations of the iraqi athletes and their hopes to achieve personal records iraqi records and records for their national unions all these hopes have come to an end this day because of this decision which is done not by iraqi hands but by foreign hands

294619 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
294620 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
294621 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace
294622 why have we come to rely on private contractors to provide combat or combat related security training for our forces
294623 mr hamdan or any accused at guantanamo but for right now mr hamdan if he is convicted he will stay at guantanamo bay if he is acquitted completely hell stay at guantanamo bay and if hes convicted and he gets lets say time served hes going to stay at guantanamo bay because the government has stated through their prosecutor mr murphy that regardless of what outcome in this case theyre allowed to detain mr hamdan for the duration of the global war on terrorism
294624 were in danger of losing our country to a war based on lies to destruction of our civil liberties but its your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save whats right and save whats dear to us but were going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again
294625 theres no question about it wall street got one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

294630 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about sixteen months that we think would be the right time frame for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
294631 artificially prolonging the tenure of us troops in iraq would cause problems
294632 sen obama conveyed that he is committed to supporting afghanistan and to continue the war against terrorism with vigor
294633 to see young people like this who are doing such excellent work with so much dedication and pride just makes me feel good about the country and i want to make sure that everybody back home understands how much pride people take in their work here and how much sacrifice people are making its outstanding
294634 the situation is getting worse here even worse than iraq if the us government sends more troops here the violence will increase for example when we see a group of us soldiers walking here it doesnt make us feel safe our afghan forces are capable enough to ensure the security of afghanistan the us government should focus on other needs of afghans not the military
294635 there have not been any changes to the lives of ordinary afghans the visits and presence of foreigners has not changed the lives of poor afghans i returned from iran after twenty years there i had the best life when i was in iran now i have work like an animal in my country in order to feed my family my life is worse now what is the benefit of these western officials coming and going
294636 you said he was the most extreme member of the senate i think is the quote
294637 you mean you really think hes an extremist i mean hes clearly liberal
294638 oh i dont know all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
294639 btselem received this morning footage filmed in the village of nilin approximately two weeks ago showing an israeli soldier firing a rubber coated steal bullet at a palestinian the palestinian has his hands tied behind his back and his eyes covered and the soldier is firing at him from very close range from approximately a meter and a half away this whole event happens in the presence of a high ranking officer a lieutenant colonel

294656 it is a palpable demonstration that we can negotiate like brothers that we can trust that we can advance together that we can overcome this silliness of competition between nations so we can advance together the cooperation between nations
294657 when the officer confessed his mistake to his superiors he said that as the helicopter was landing he saw such a quantity of guerrillas that he became very nervous and that he was afraid for his life and that he took out of his pocket the piece of cloth with the symbol of the international red cross committee logo that he carried in his pocket and put it on his bulletproof vest we regret that this has occurred
294658 when a public system fails repeatedly to meet these minimal objectives parents ask only for a choice in their education of their children some parents some parents may choose a better public school some may choose a private school many will choose a charter school no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
294659 i dont know and i dont know if the in fact im quite confident that the people who officially will determine that dont know either
294660 but do you feel that the people that are impacting it feel that were in a recession

294666 the new president who will replace president bush is not going to change his policy in iraq his policy will remain the same regarding the occupation and iraq will see no change i do not think that he is going to change anything because the us policy is clear to everyone
294667 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
294668 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
294669 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
294670 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
294671 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested
294672 as we sign this memorandum of understanding we all commit ourselves to the first tentative step towards searching for a solution to the country that is in a crisis
294673 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
294674 i crossed an artificial line today because appalachia is my homeland and its life is being destroyed far faster than it can regenerate
294675 they handcuffed me and placed me under the sun for about three hours then they picked me up walked me for a little bit and shot at me i found myself on the ground they told me we are going to fire a rubber bullet at you and i did not imagine that this is how they were going to act to open fire at me while i am handcuffed
294676 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality

294689 as part of the war on terror for the first time in its history the united states has sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment american held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
294690 bad news the reason were not getting better intelligence part of the reasoning anyway is that about a third of the people are innocent
294691 do you know anything about islamic radicals do you speak arabic have you got any background in this area
294692 the allegation that i provided assistance in the process of torture is completely false
294693 i gave a three hour lecture sponsored by sere the survival evasion resistance escape branch of the american armed forces at the san diego naval base in may 2002
294694 i have not worked under government contract or any other contract on any aspect of interrogation or any aspect of torture
294695 i have had no contact at all with the american psychological association about their relevant policies most importantly i strongly disapprove of torture and have never and would never provide assistance in its process
294696 if psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving
294697 i am ashamed we are even having this conversation of course waterboarding is torture
294698 if it was done to me i would think it was torture
294699 you know you may acknowledge these laws or not but these laws exist
294700 are there weapons of mass destruction in iraq and are there connections between al qaeda and saddam hussein

294706 what is your position on senator dodds pledge to filibuster a bill that contains retroactive immunity
294707 oh theres good faith reasons not to impeach or to criminally prosecute
294708 well there may be legal excuses as to why he did that
294709 well these are important intellectual issues that we need to grapple with and its really not fair to put them inside of a courtroom or talk about prison

294712 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
294713 contrary to everything the canadian public has been told about omar khadr the tapes do not show a dangerous terrorist but instead a frightened wounded canadian boy pleading for help from canadian officials instead of helping they casually dismiss his claims of abuse and mistreatment and tell him that they will do nothing for him
294714 we are hoping that the canadian public will recognize that you put aside any concerns of guilt or innocence that has to be determined in a properly constituted court which of course is not guantanamo bay and look at compassion as we feel the children have a special significance in society this kid has suffered enough this kid needs to come home this kid is not a terrorist
294715 i heard somebody say well its going to take seven years well if wed have done it seven years ago wed be having a different conversation today im not suggesting wed have completely created a you know changed the dynamics in the world but it certainly would have been wed have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas
294716 this war diminishes our security our standing in the world our military our economy and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the twenty first century by any measure our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction and to seize this moments promise

294725 so today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within ten years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
294726 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

294735 what i saw was abhorrently graphic yet far too important for the world to ignore i present images that provide an uncensored view of a terrible event and some small measure of dignity to those who lost their lives
294736 how can things change if all that comes out of iraq are sanitized white washed images of war designed for mainstream media outlets who focus on making money not on the quality and truth in what they report
294737 im not worried about my own safety im here to do my job im here to document
294738 well theres nothing in the embed rules that say you cant show someone whos identifiable as a marine it says no identifiable features you know to identify that person from you know another person but actually showing an injured soldier or a dead soldier is not something that is barred in the embed rules
294739 by posting the images and your commentary you violated 14 h and o of the news media agreement you signed
294740 by providing detailed information of the effectiveness of the attack and response of us forces to it you have put all us forces in iraq at greater risk for harm
294741 the marines have not been able to prove anything that they have claimed against you

294746 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
294747 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
294748 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus

294761 sometimes during campaigns rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
294762 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
294763 you know progressives and liberals dont know how to play poker there has to be somewhere to go
294764 oh well well give you aid but we want you to privatize your water your electricity system hand the coastline over to resorts

294768 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
294769 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
294770 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
294771 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
294772 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
294773 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
294774 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
294775 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
294776 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
294777 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
294778 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation

294781 as you know fannie mae and freddie mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction
294782 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
294783 john mccain and george bush both said that if iraq as a sovereign government stated that it was time for us to start withdrawing our troops then they would respect the wishes of that sovereign government and given that i think its also in our strategic interests it certainly strikes me that we shouldnt be writing a status of forces agreement for example that locks in a long term occupation
294784 its 7 00 in the morning its time for him to get up smell the coffee and know the american people are sick and tired of war were already in one quagmire in iraq we dont want another one in iran
294785 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

294788 interpreting after the largest ice raid in us history a personal account
294789 then began the saddest procession i have ever witnessed which the public would never see because cameras were not allowed past the perimeter of the compound driven single file in groups of 10 shackled at the wrists waist and ankles chains dragging as they shuffled through the slaughterhouse workers were brought in for arraignment sat and listened through headsets to the interpreted initial appearance before marching out again to be bused to different county jails only to make room for the next row of 10 they appeared to be uniformly no more than 5 ft tall mostly illiterate guatemalan peasants with mayan last names some in tears others with faces of worry fear and embarrassment
294790 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river

294794 we were trying to get to the bulldozers we were risking no one and it seems that with the return to tactics and strategies of the first intifada by this village and the movement against the wall it seems that the army is returning to the old commands as well of breaking arms and legs of demonstrators
294795 im here visiting with the good people of nilin on this the fourth anniversary of the landmark advisory opinion and ruling by the international court of justice ruling which as you all know requires cessation of building of the wall destroying or removing the part of it that had been built and also dealing with the issue as a form of colonization and settlement activity with all that comes with that with all that comes with that by way of violation of rights of palestinians including importantly human rights
294796 were very pleased that the judge recognized on the record that my father is neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk we are hoping that immigration and customs enforcement will do the right thing and release him
294797 im not going to retract any of it every word i said was true
294798 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and defend the interests of our allies weve done that both by i think you know that in the gulf area the united states has enhanced its security capacity its security presence and we are working closely with all of our allies to make certain that they are capable of defending themselves and we take very very strongly our obligation to help our allies defend themselves and no one should be confused about that

294804 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems
294805 you know what if lenders go outside of their responsibilities they can be sued they can have to pay out they can lose certain amounts of money that they have counted on
294806 we dont like that we dont like to be accountable for what were doing
294807 we were able to do this because of these unregulated swaps
294808 you know what heres 300 billion to the federal housing association and they will be able to effectively insure those mortgages to the lenders
294809 you know were going to help you the banking system get through the mess you created and you know what we want more power to basically regulate you in the future because we didnt do it enough to begin with during the last few years while all of these problems were brewing
294810 i believe the man we need to meet the mortal need today is here he is experienced but has not lost his common sense or his ability to be outraged his conservatism is not the result of a studied philosophy but of common sense and personal observation his name is john mccain he might not be the right president for all times but he is the right president for these times
294811 well we cant let bear stearns fail because then all these people will lose their jobs and well have a domino effect
294812 ok well were going to help you out but were going to demand that you act more responsibly and were going to demand that you let us see what youre doing
294813 you know were not just going to help a few homeowners right now we need to change the entire system we need to make it transparent we need to make the legislation enforceable and we need to bring some control into whats going on and understanding of what we need to be looking for

294822 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
294823 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
294824 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
294825 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
294826 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
294827 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
294828 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
294829 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change
294830 the ticket was for trespassing he said if i came back into the plaza i would be arrested and taken to jail the sign says mccain bush now in a republican event why is that offensive why would republicans who voted for bush find it offensive that a sign says bush mccain or mccain bush

294833 received decent treatment and no extraordinary measures were taken against him

294863 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
294864 would you accompany me to the exterior of this building
294865 you are in brazil you may be experiencing a headache
294866 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
294867 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
294868 we will take your nuclear technology but you must take our mangos
294869 look they will take our nuclear technology but we need to take their mangos

294874 i kept playing the movie over in my head many times had i been pressured had i been stubborn today with the perspective of years behind me i feel it was my destiny i feel that i had to live through what i lived through that i had to find out what i found out i have a ph d in the farc that i hope will be useful to those of us who want to help with all this i think there are moments in life in which one is at a crossroads between what one wants to do and what one has to do
294875 i dont want to answer that question from an emotional perspective because this is such a big blow to the farc that it would be easy to say that the farc is destroyed i simply want to give you testimony of what i lived through since a year ago it has been hard for supplies to arrive we have had little to eat very little variety in the food no fruit no greens thats a signal that the logistics could be going through difficulty
294876 mindless u s support of a regime that tacitly allowed paramilitary groups to function should not be applauded nor should the hundreds of trade union leaders that have been murdered during the uribe presidency be forgotten
294877 i would like to see our continued assistance to countries like colombia and mexico we have just reached an agreement with mexico to try to do what is best for america and that would be to stem the flow of cocaine
294878 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

294881 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems
294882 you know what if lenders go outside of their responsibilities they can be sued they can have to pay out they can lose certain amounts of money that they have counted on
294883 we dont like that we dont like to be accountable for what were doing
294884 we were able to do this because of these unregulated swaps
294885 you know what heres 300 billion to the federal housing association and they will be able to effectively insure those mortgages to the lenders
294886 you know were going to help you the banking system get through the mess you created and you know what we want more power to basically regulate you in the future because we didnt do it enough to begin with during the last few years while all of these problems were brewing
294887 i believe the man we need to meet the mortal need today is here he is experienced but has not lost his common sense or his ability to be outraged his conservatism is not the result of a studied philosophy but of common sense and personal observation his name is john mccain he might not be the right president for all times but he is the right president for these times
294888 well we cant let bear stearns fail because then all these people will lose their jobs and well have a domino effect
294889 ok well were going to help you out but were going to demand that you act more responsibly and were going to demand that you let us see what youre doing
294890 you know were not just going to help a few homeowners right now we need to change the entire system we need to make it transparent we need to make the legislation enforceable and we need to bring some control into whats going on and understanding of what we need to be looking for

294899 it is deeply hypocritical that they should be lavishing course after course on world leaders when there is a food crisis and millions cannot afford a decent meal
294900 just whos doing the hoarding food independence and real democracy
294901 oh yeah you know 18 million children are dying a year of hunger lets shift food into agrofuel

294904 irans will and authority to the enemies that have threatened iran with harsh language in recent weeks
294905 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
294906 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
294907 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
294908 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
294909 we have great confidence that the political leadership in iraq would not take an action that would destabilize the country
294910 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that im flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me ive been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow thats me trying to look like im you know more centered more centrist is just not true dont assume that if i dont agree with you on something that it must be because im doing that politically i may just disagree with you
294911 the government is stonewalling again by not allowing americans private dollars to be paid to american lawyers to defend civil liberties
294912 the chinese government is using the opportunity of hosting olympics to showcase the china that the chinese government wants the world to see and cover up the china that the chinese government does not want the outside to see so we came here to reveal this china to the other side of the world and more than that we have to send a message to the international community
294913 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

294916 one of the greatest intrusions potentially on the rights of americans protected under the fourth amendment of the us constitution in the history of our country
294917 a federal judge in california said wednesday that the wiretapping law established by congress was the exclusive means for the president to eavesdrop on americans and he rejected the governments claim that the presidents constitutional authority as commander in chief trumped that law
294918 made his findings in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by an oregon charity the group says it has evidence of an illegal wiretap used against it by the national security agency under the secret surveillance program established by president bush after the terrorist attacks of sept 11

294925 peru is a sovereign important country its a big country in the world and so we cant stand idly by as an outsider takes the liberty of provoking our country let alone from the president of bolivia himself this whole thing that there is a us base in peru is grounded in outrageous lies and manipulations
294926 i have personally experienced what it is like to live with a us military base north american soldiers who are armed wearing uniforms who instruct our armed forces who instruct the national police to participate in repressions to participate in massacres i have to share that experience with my latin american brothers it is an obligation of those who defend dignity

294946 i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term

294948 we have contributed the least to climate change but we are carrying the heavy burden of solving the climate change problem and so we would like them to ensure that we are included in the negotiations of the climate change convention so that we can contribute more substantially in shaping solutions
294949 the reality is in africa every single day 6 000 people die from hiv aids alone another 7 000 people die from malaria another 2 000 3 000 die from tuberculosis if those numbers of deaths were happening in europe or north america we are convinced the g8 would long time ago have found the money to address these issues so we want to see the same kind of urgency

294987 im really disappointed in the environmental community and the bullying thats going on of first nations who are desperately trying to get away from welfare reserves to becoming economically self sufficient self governing communities
294988 when you threaten to put on a worldwide boycott of these small vulnerable communities i think thats as close to being a bully as you can get
294989 because we want to ensure that a resolution addressing both first nations economic development and forest conservation is given every opportunity to emerge we will reserve further comment at this time
294990 as a result of this study we have opened a free standing patient centered facility in a more convenient location designed specifically for our screening mammography patients
294991 when you talk about inflation rates going up people are saying they cut down on bigger entertainment avenues like holidays eating out etc
294992 movies is what they are calling a three hour holiday these are called rejuvenation centres
294993 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
294994 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
294995 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
294996 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
294997 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
294998 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications
294999 california may not indirectly regulate noncoercive speech about unionization by imposing spending restrictions on the use of state funds
295000 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
295001 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
295002 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
295003 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
295004 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
295005 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
295006 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
295007 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
295008 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
295009 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
295010 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
295011 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
295012 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
295013 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
295014 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
295015 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
295016 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
295017 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
295018 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
295019 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
295020 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
295021 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
295022 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
295023 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
295024 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
295025 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
295026 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
295027 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
295028 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
295029 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
295030 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
295031 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
295032 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
295033 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
295034 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
295035 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
295036 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
295037 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
295038 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
295039 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
295040 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
295041 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
295042 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
295043 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
295044 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
295045 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
295046 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
295047 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
295048 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
295049 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
295050 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
295051 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
295052 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
295053 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
295054 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
295055 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
295056 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
295057 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
295058 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
295059 who are open to doing something on the production side
295060 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
295061 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
295062 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
295063 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
295064 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
295065 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
295066 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
295067 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
295068 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
295069 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
295070 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
295071 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
295072 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
295073 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
295074 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
295075 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
295076 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
295077 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
295078 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
295079 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
295080 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
295081 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
295082 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
295083 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
295084 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
295085 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
295086 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
295087 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
295088 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
295089 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
295090 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
295091 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well

295093 to protect your network from a cracker youve got to get inside that crackers mind by participating in a class that is incredibly intensive and extremely hands on the students are really able to see hacking techniques in action and figure out how to derail them
295094 computer security is more important now than ever before network security is an ongoing process its not something that you can just setup and leave it requires constant attendance and support you also have to diligently keep current with the industry

295098 we love the inventory products section its incredibly easy to change descriptions and images as well as make new products if we want to add a new product to our website we can do it in less than five minutes this is especially impressive for us because were not like a typical online store that simply pushes boxes from place to place everything on our website is highly customizable and as a result our products require much more fine tuning before they can be released
295099 volusion simplifies the process of adding new products changing images and descriptions and adding product options thanks to the features volusion provides we are able to keep our website consistent throughout minor design tweaks and reformatting are incredibly simple
295100 dont allow yourself to rest or get complacent even if your website is the best in your industry keep working every time we make an improvement to our website even in an insignificant area a customer takes advantage of it and the result is more revenue for our company
295101 the pace of job erosion is slowing down said mike moran a senior currency strategist at standard chartered in new york
295102 europe is catching up with where the u s has been it does put a floor under the dollar
295103 the market will start to focus on the rise of the unemployment rate which could cause concerns about the weakness of the economy said dustin reid a senior currency strategist at abn amro bank nv in chicago
295104 im not ready to call a bottom in the dollar just yet
295105 one of our customers told us that their system was inundated and their internat gateway came to a halt during march madness with the basketball playoffs last year
295106 if enough people in a building or in a certain area logged on around the same time there definitely could be some significant effect
295107 we have thousands of servers at the edge of the last mile networks and deliver content to those servers which stream them directly to the last mile
295108 akamai is working with the european broadcast union to deliver olympic video to the sites they support
295109 i want to be clear that the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft
295110 to this day i cannot tell you why they withdrew their offer to acquire us
295111 there may be a few more dollars on the table
295112 there was never anything given to the board in writing
295113 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
295114 i still believe theres something there to be gained i want them to buy yahoo
295115 i think yahoo is a leader in internet human rights efforts
295116 weve done right with the families and ive been personally involved we have a lot more work to do weve condemned the chinese government for blocking peoples use of the net and set up a fund for internet and any human rights abuses around china
295117 hvad er det da for noget br k de plejer sgu da altid at sende de her gode gamle klassikere
295118 it is alleged she was grabbed from behind when walking back through her front door and a man then bound her hands and feet with wire and gagged her mouth with a cloth
295119 i can see us having an mp and i wouldnt be surprised if its not caroline lucas in brighton pavilion
295120 i think they could well elect someone with as high a profile as caroline
295121 she lived in an area where theres a lot of green activity oxford she managed to get elected to europe and she got a springboard to a higher profile
295122 but that doesnt make me any less of a candidate believe me the reason im standing is because the green party would rather have an election than a coronation we want to give people a choice
295123 some people expect caroline to get in on a landslide but i dont think itll be a landslide i think the outcome might surprise quite a lot of people
295124 im more of a grass roots bottom up type of activist whereas i believe caroline is more centrist
295125 i think she wants to lead the party from top down
295126 the reason i joined the green party initially is because it had a grass roots approach and that separated it from the other main political parties its seemed to be their downfall labour has taken that approach to the max recently and i think its turned into their nemesis
295127 now the parties have taken on environmentalism and i have to say its a cynical move
295128 theyve corrupted the idea of environmentalism because theyve used the idea to gain more money in taxes the government new labour or the
295129 should something be done to reduce bps profit making ability
295130 call for windfall tax on bps obscene 37 million a day
295131 in response to the question would i run around naked i will take any and all advice that is in the policyholders interest
295132 more people are dying we are going to lobby with all the vigour that we can to get the commission established quickly
295133 it is a fact that policyholders paid through their premiums for the regulation which in the event turned out to be failing
295134 policyholders paid for their side of the bargain and the government should now pay for theirs policyholders were entitled to proper regulation and did not get it
295135 fifty per cent of policyholders were ordinary people tesco and post office workers
295136 they are spread all across the country to pretend we are simply representing the issues of middle england is not justified
295137 i have not got a clue of how that number was derived
295138 neither the society nor the parliamentary ombudsman has at any time or any way suggested what the total compensation figure should be we have not done so because it would be foolish or impertinent to try to do the work of the compensation commission
295139 we did not know if the pressures we read about would result in potential bidders battening down the hatches
295140 but the biggest ones are sufficiently capitalised and sufficiently keen to take advantage of the opportunity which we represent
295141 made it enormously clear her conclusions were irrelevant to the society
295142 there have been huge numbers of claims since 2001 all legitimate claims have long since been paid for by the society
295143 if the government does not accept the parliamentary ombudsmans recommendations then i will ask it what has happened to its moral compass we will strain every muscle to bring this to a conclusion
295144 we have always said that it is entirely reasonable to expect passengers to pay the environmental costs of their travel
295145 it now looks that we have been paying more than our fair share for some time
295146 fuel surcharges over the last few years have pushed up costs for ordinary travellers
295147 the government now admits that uk air travel more than covers its climate change costs but they still seem intent on increasing the environmental taxes that air travellers are forced to pay
295148 the governments admission that aviation more than covers its environmental costs is a nail in the coffin of those who hysterically lay the blame for global warming at the door of aviation
295149 our competitor is regarded as one of the most ferociously competitive on the planet they have launched smoothies this year and we are their target
295150 we are at the beginning of a drawn out fight they have fired off their big gun and are waiting for the smoke to clear we are still standing but they have a lot more guns
295151 when we started out we had a belief that if youre making something that people consume you have an absolute responsibility to make that thing natural and healthy
295152 but then we were three 26 year olds who couldnt get our phone calls returned now i have three people just pushing on supply chain ethics as innocent has got bigger we have got more innocent
295153 pepsi is out there offering supermarkets hundreds of thousands of pounds to delist our smoothie lines
295154 that is what they do if you look at any market they come into their stance is to take on the independents by running crazy promotions take their business and then raise prices look at walkers crisps they completely caned the competitors and became a virtual monopoly
295155 we have lost some listings to tropicana but were slowly getting them back people will try anything new once especially if its half the price
295156 were in a david and goliath situation if you go into the chilled fruit fridge in the supermarket it is all owned by pepsico
295157 its a tough fight for us because pepsi might call up the supermarkets and say if you dont give us what we want on orange juice were not going to give you what you want on walkers crisps
295158 this is the only brand theyve seen which might make inroads
295159 were going in with a promise of taste quality and ethics while pepsi is about cheaper prices
295160 it gives us an opportunity to dramatically widen the demographics of the brand a litre of smoothie is 2 99 a litre of orange juice will be 1 89 people can buy into the innocent ideals at a lower price point
295161 were looking at smaller pack sizes weve got to find a way to make quality affordable
295162 we see japan korea and india as real opportunities as these countries are determined to increase their defence spending
295163 india used to import equipment from russia in the old days but we think there is huge market potential to create indigenous industry there
295164 it is not just spending money for todays operations but tomorrows operations as well
295165 clearly we are benefiting from the continuing operations in iraq and afghanistan
295166 ill support votes at 16 when half a million 15 to 17 year olds march on parliament demanding it
295167 why shouldnt they be allowed to vote when they can join the army buy alcohol have sex pay tax etc
295168 hi i just wanted to let you know that ive put ryuganji on japan in
295169 hi ana yes it is http www phantom film com ne ws index html
295170 may i know if the company distributing this film is
295171 she knows about it people have told her but she hasnt seen it and she doesnt plan to
295172 she doesnt consider herself a political figure and so she does not appreciate being used in that way
295173 shes already said shes not too happy about it shed prefer the candidates just leave her out of it
295174 somebody saw them there and took advantage of the opportunity
295175 most likely it took more than one person or a very large truck and it took multiple trips back and forth
295176 if you have an air conditioning unit someones probably going to steal it at some point you need to take whatever precautions you can to protect yourself
295177 there is such a high demand for copper and aluminum right now and the price is just out the roof and its very simple for air conditioners to be stolen
295178 and it activates if theres a break in the circuit or it ties into the refrigeration circuit
295179 tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
295180 we are interested in the nature and extent to which you engage in such practices and the impact it could have on consumer privacy
295181 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
295182 time to get a move on time to get back on the road
295183 hey baby you brought me coffee you get groovier every day
295184 now that hes with us i dont know but somehow we did didnt we baby it may not have always been graceful and smooth but we made it together
295185 yeah i guess you could say we pretty much did
295186 you know it after the film well request your new birth certificate and go from there
295187 you realize youll only have my beat up old black truck to drive around
295188 joe needed to live his life im on the road a lot it wasnt fair to either of us
295189 i really dont know how to describe that club right now it just seems to be a train wreck out there
295190 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
295191 you can kill the creature link by taking its life
295192 competiram com alguns atletas ol mpicos nacionais adivinhe o resultado
295193 bring to the brink of a tantrum by supremely irritating comments then just as a complete meltdown is about to ensue flinging to the ground and rubbing with a three day growth of beard equivalent to a bed of nails while the victim furiously pummels him with both fists
295194 hark thou daughter of mine enemy buddhist or not given the chance im going to impale you on my sharpened horns like chicken satay
295195 if you sneeze save if an npc talks to you save if the time since epoch is evenly divisible by 2 save
295196 do blogs really make money or is this all hype
295197 they should not have linked the security and the legal issues in darfur this is international justice
295198 they havent made a full commitment to really say that they are going to delay the courts work
295199 all these countries are dictatorships and many violate human rights and commit crimes against their people
295200 they are afraid also to be accused and go to the court
295201 as an african i feel embarrassed and shocked by the action of the african union
295202 theyll be a lot more ready this year what we did last year was unbelievable it was a dream come true the only thing id like this year and its not much is just to finish one spot higher
295203 im sure that if id tried to do this in 1998 just after winning the championship it would have been a lot easier
295204 although theres a lot of respect for what ive achieved my oval experience is not huge and even though there was the indy 500 win in 1995 ultimately what people want to know is how youd do in a 36 race season how you do on the ovals and are you still hungry enough to do it
295205 a good showing would help with the sponsors but it wont have any effect on the teams because this is a road course
295206 we had a good race last year but you can tell the level of competition has stepped up
295207 im confident weve got a good crew here and a good car unfortunately most nascar races are like the last two minutes of overtime in hockey it gets out of control if theres a caution with 10 minutes to go cautions breed cautions theres going to be a lot of contact thats what caught us out last year we need to avoid that
295208 he is an amazing road course racer and hes been driving this thing since january
295209 so if he was strong last year he should be even stronger
295210 goodyear brought rain tires but i think theyve been towing them around for six years
295211 i saw them in mexico in march and they looked a little purple
295212 but i feel good in the rain i think we have an advantage but whatever nascar decides to do youve got to be versatile
295213 my guess is thered be a lot of carnage and you dont want that
295214 when youve got high speed approaches long braking zones and tight corners it makes it very difficult in the wet
295215 its not like mosport or le mans or even mont tremblant where you can sweep through the corners this place itll be tough
295216 if theres any doubt and guys arent sure i think they should be playing
295217 you can be retired for the rest of your life youll know when youre done
295218 if youre not 100 per cent certain that you dont want to play anymore then the decision is that you should be playing
295219 people always told me play as long as you can i think these guys youre talking about still have some good years left in them
295220 i think guys want to be certain and just do it once
295221 you look at what brett favre is going through right now its better when you make the decision just to do it one time
295222 its better for everyone if its the right decision and you dont change your mind and have any regrets after
295223 he really felt that he was at a point in his life where he really wanted time to do other things and felt like he was missing out a little bit
295224 i think once he took half a year off he realized that those things will be there when hockeys over
295225 i wouldnt be surprised if he ends up playing again after this contract
295226 i loved playing the game and everything about it if i could have remained healthy and trained and what not i wouldve kept playing
295227 if better material was used it would at least not turn into rubble like this

295234 ole is an inspiration to anyone hoping for a long career in football he has dedicated himself to his profession
295235 in the modern day game anyone who manages 10 years or more at one club is exceptional particularly when that one club is not from the players own country
295236 when a young kid walks in here eventually i want them to go home to their mother and father and be the same person it is not easy in modern day life
295237 success can change people so can money and this is in an industry which is very vulnerable

295250 this ruling is a significant victory for florida gun owners
295251 nra wanted to reinforce that it is wrong for corporations to arbitrarily demand that every man and woman on their payroll give up their right to defend themselves and their loved ones or give up their jobs we are thankful the judge found floridas law to be constitutional and we hope the ruling will bring an end to a pattern of corporate disregard for gun owners civil rights
295252 this is a huge win for the people this bill is about protecting the sanctity of every working man and womans fundamental right to self defense
295253 in a day and age where commutes are longer and people spend more time running errands before and after work hard working men and women in our country should not have their basic god given right to self defense trampled by corporate giants
295254 the district of columbias so called emergency regulations prohibit law abiding citizens from protecting themselves and their loved ones in their own homes
295255 the mayor and city council have proposed a list of regulations that violate the supreme courts decision
295256 the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
295257 the d c council and mayor are demonstrating their arrogant disregard for the supreme courts decision and the safety and liberty of their own law abiding constituents
295258 these elitist politicians who live under secured protection are continuing to prevent their residents from keeping a functional firearm in the home for self defense
295259 the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense

295267 truthfully indy always wears tires out and no one knew we had a problem until id say the end of the first practice saturday when we really tried to make some long runs and the track wasnt taking rubber into the start of the second practice and by then its too late
295268 i mean all the indications before that were the same as its always been we were on course for what we always see except for the fact that the tire turned into a powder and a dust and didnt lay into the track with the circumstances we had i really think nascar called a great race
295269 the race was fun regardless of the pit stops and all the cautions
295270 it just created a different atmosphere for me from behind the drivers seat i wasnt too bothered or upset with it it was a million different ways it could have been done i dont think any of them were wrong i think the way it was handled was the best way it could possibly be handled
295271 i dont blame them for anything that happened there for some reason it didnt do what it has done in the past
295272 the tires are a lot different than they used to be
295273 over the period of the last five or 10 years the tires just get harder and dryer and spitting off more black powder i dont know i kind of like the old gummy tires
295274 i think there were too many excuses that were made and its over and done with it and now we can only go back there next year and try to get a tire thats going to last
295275 last week was just a long weekend it was definitely a long day and the second to last run we had a set of tires that the car didnt like and we had no choice but to come in and put four tires on the car
295276 at the least it was kind of challenging and to be perfectly honest with you i find it fun when things are challenging
295277 its not the normal ok here we go is the caution gonna come out

295281 were all on the same page on this and everything is going according to the plan i was mad at texas and you know im not going to hide it if im mad about it we dont have a shot of getting back in the top 35 and so when you get to that position then you can try a lot of different stuff
295282 it gives you an opportunity for chad to run some places like here charlotte and get some experience so we can really evaluate him

295284 ive got no problem running the third car if you can put the right program together

295303 in all directions stretched the great australian emptiness in which the mind is the least of possessions
295304 beyond the horizon a great creative impulse is at work the only thing that gives this continent meaning and a guarantee of the future every australian ought to climb up here and glimpse the various manifold life of which he is a part
295305 australia has a marvellous sky and air and blue clarity and a hoary sort of land beneath it like a sleeping princess on whom the dust of ages has settled
295306 id move to los angeles if new zealand and australia were swallowed up by a tidal wave if there was a bubonic plague in england and if the continent of africa disappeared from some martian attack
295307 having australia to come back to keeps you sane its this clarity which gives australian models an edge overseas they have a positive mental outlook on life and get out there and do things other models would freak out about
295308 this reminds us once again that in california we have to be prepared for anything and everything

295311 i knew that because this product looks just like a full wetsuit that there might be confusion and questions at non wetsuit legal races

295313 our underlying fabric is very different from anything else ever used in swim skin designs making it stretch 30 more than what is currently on the market which means it can fit like a second skin but have no restrictions of movement
295314 from energy reform and life sciences to strengthened civil rights and child protections the house had an aggressive agenda this session and we delivered
295315 the budgeting largely ignores the fiscal perils that are facing massachusetts and every other state and i think theres a sharp contrast between the approaches many other states are taking which is preparing for the worst and the very traditional approach massachusetts is taking as it we were in normal economic times
295316 at a time when the rest of the country is pretty much retrenching were pushing our debt limits here
295317 there were a lot of big ticket items and a lot was accomplished
295318 any time you come that close within a of success and dont quite make it its disappointing

295326 in 1733 a long time before j j horgan bishop moriarty or john biggs davison jonathan swift observed that the catholics of ireland were always defenders of monarchy as constituted in these kingdoms and that the presbyterians or dissenters were the true republicans both in principle and in practice swift was both knowledgeable and prophetic the first irish republican movement the society of united irishmen was initiated in 1791 by william drennan a belfast presbyterian and in the north of ireland was led mainly by presbyterians many of whom laymen and clergy were imprisoned banished from ireland or executed after the rebellion of 1798 the sources of their republicanism correctly identified by horgan were tom paine and jean jacques rousseau the american declaration of independence and the french revolution in 1793 the anniversary of the fall of the bastille was celebrated in belfast by presbyterian radicals who had already read the rights of man their banners proclaimed liberty equality and fraternity

295334 the scottish government and any government with a principled stance should not be going near any firm with such associations even indirectly
295335 the government is opening itself up to significant and justified protest
295336 ordinary members of the public could refuse to have anything to do with the census a boycott is something to be considered it would be a legitimate step we cannot ignore our principles
295337 the scottish government was elected on a mandate that it had a human rights conscience and was different to labour now it seems the scottish government is already closing its eyes to what is going on overseas would we say it was ok if a firm connected to mugabe was hired to run our census it is unacceptable that they have been hired this will horrify most ordinary people it is unacceptable that the scottish government should be selling its soul to an organisation accused of torturing human beings
295338 the us government doesnt give a damn about peoples rights itll gather data in any way possible how can we be sure that the census information will not be handed over to the us government in the interests of homeland security

295403 i think manny in the middle of the order will make a bigger difference than pitching assuming hes at least 50 percent sane or i hope that he does it would be nice if for once a new acqusition didnt go down the toilet
295404 considering the caliber of the restrooms i am sure even manny will not go
295405 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
295406 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
295407 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
295408 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter
295409 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
295410 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
295411 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
295412 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before
295413 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
295414 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
295415 to make my opponents all tired and then just beat them
295416 but i kept believing in myself and i knew that if i didnt make as many mistakes i could get back in the match
295417 im starting to believe that i can beat the best players in the world im not giving them as much respect
295418 it was a little bit uncomfortable for a few points
295419 he was playing too well and my game was not up to scratch
295420 i just had to try and stay tough and not give up
295421 in a tiebreak its most important to serve well and to use your chances
295422 i was playing well this week so im happy about that
295423 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
295424 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
295425 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
295426 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
295427 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
295428 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
295429 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
295430 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
295431 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
295432 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
295433 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
295434 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
295435 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football
295436 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
295437 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day

295446 if theres any doubt and guys arent sure i think they should be playing
295447 you can be retired for the rest of your life youll know when youre done
295448 if youre not 100 per cent certain that you dont want to play anymore then the decision is that you should be playing
295449 people always told me play as long as you can i think these guys youre talking about still have some good years left in them
295450 i think guys want to be certain and just do it once
295451 you look at what brett favre is going through right now its better when you make the decision just to do it one time
295452 its better for everyone if its the right decision and you dont change your mind and have any regrets after
295453 he really felt that he was at a point in his life where he really wanted time to do other things and felt like he was missing out a little bit
295454 i think once he took half a year off he realized that those things will be there when hockeys over
295455 i wouldnt be surprised if he ends up playing again after this contract
295456 i loved playing the game and everything about it if i could have remained healthy and trained and what not i wouldve kept playing

295481 if he does there could be a future if he doesnt hell stay exactly where he is now for the next two and a half years on the sidelines and he wont play
295482 look after the farm 350 sheep and the chickens get post just once a week open the pub on demand and duck when the wind blows
295483 you dont have to share it with anyone unless you want to
295484 wed met on lundy island and decided as students that wed like to own an island
295485 we were living in a village house at the time and just thought we had to go for it our four children were still young enough that they could move schools
295486 sanda is one of a few scottish islands to print its own stamps
295487 people from northern ireland have taken to coming here for a meal in the evening and it is popular with yachtsmen and locals from the mainland
295488 but a new owner could shut the doors on it if they wanted to
295489 there are no new houses on the island and no permanent residents except the owners
295490 princess anne moored her yacht at sanda to come and buy our eggs
295491 she must have heard that they were good the chickens peck about on the beach theyre completely free range
295492 since the arrival of rigid inflatables it has been a whole new ball game but the water sometimes comes up over the boat
295493 we employ a couple to keep an eye on the sheep look after the chickens and do general maintenance the post boat comes over once a week depending on the weather
295494 this is the only island in the area to come on the market in five years there is not much available in these waters
295495 the farmhouse could be improved it is situated on the south side of the island with the original farm square you can keep a yacht in the bay and sail from here around the west coast of scotland it will attract interest from those who are active in the international property market
295496 it takes to the end of summer for the waters to heat up but it is the complete peacefulness of the island that makes it so beautiful no picture can do it justice
295497 its so painful coming face to face with your weaknesses and being slowly destroyed by someone better than you
295498 it is a lifeline of sanity in what can otherwise be a crowded and fast moving life
295499 quite apart from the quality of french schools medicine beaches and housing
295500 we lived in a victorian terrace house in exeter but wanted to have children in a big house in the countryside if wed tried to do that in the uk we would both have had to work all hours to pay the mortgage we sold up bought in france without a mortgage and put money in the bank
295501 a van draws up about once a week with manuscripts once i have corrected them i can upload the changes and send them back online i only need to go back to england every few months for meetings with authors and its a very easy journey with expenses paid
295502 we dont have an extravagant lifestyle and i have time to spend in the vegetable patch or raising chickens which also cut the cost of living the flexibility is wonderful if im busy adam has jack if im quiet i spend time with jack while adam works on the house
295503 its usually the car as i tend to have a boot full of bottles french wines to england and on the way back i stock up on new world wines almost nonexistent on the shelves of french supermarkets at calais
295504 there is almost nowhere musicians can go on holiday and be allowed to practise while they are away
295505 the first was after i had put my name down for a place here
295506 i went back to my home in bury st edmunds and i just lay there for hours thinking what have i done
295507 the second was when i had just moved in here i know its silly but at four oclock in the morning i got out of bed switched on all the lights and walked round my new apartment i went into every room one after the other thinking how lovely it was
295508 i had a five bedroom home outside bury st edmunds where i had lived for 30 years yet i was moving to a two bedroom apartment 100 miles away
295509 actually it wasnt so much my house but my friends that i was worried about leaving at my farewell party they presented me with this wonderful collection of photographs stretching back over three decades pictures of me my late husband and my daughters wedding
295510 but since coming here i havent looked back i had marvellous friends in bury and i still talk to them on the phone but i see all that part of my life as a closed chapter brilliant but still closed
295511 i find im more interested in discovering new things and places round here
295512 its funny because we travelled all over the world looking for a place like this we found the perfect set up in australia the only problem was that i couldnt stand the heat so we came back here for a second look and were so keen to move in that we rented a place on the site for six months until our new apartment was ready
295513 theres a food shop doctors surgery health spa caf bar and restaurant all on site and we dont have to worry about finding plumbers and maintenance men because theyre all here on tap
295514 people are paying not just for the bricks and mortar they are paying for the lifestyle
295515 the one thing we dont want is that this should become an old peoples ghetto
295516 were happy to welcome people in but on our terms
295517 we dont for example want the bar to become too attractive to noisy 18 year olds who want to watch the football
295518 it could be a bit depressing seeing nothing but old people
295519 but there is a steady stream of young staff and at weekends the restaurant is full of residents families
295520 you wont meet anyone if you sit in your flat and wait for people to knock
295521 that is one of the unwritten rules here that no one bothers you once your front door is closed
295522 sat solutions manual for over 20 but that really is irresponsible on the part of the publishers or a boondoggle that isnt fair to the consumers for heavens sake include the explanations isnt hundreds of millions a year enough profit
295523 be wary of mathematicians particularly when they speak the truth
295524 living is easy with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see
295525 be wary of mathematicians particularly when they speak the truth
295526 no other book on the market can guarantee results to this level of accuracy
295527 it looks like the corporate headquarters to some fortune 500 company

295542 many of my clients are women who have recently come out of long term relationships
295543 unsurprisingly they are insecure about taking the plunge again others are young men who dont know where to start but the common factor is usually a simple lack of confidence funnily enough most are successful business professionals but they fall apart socially yet the skills that guarantee them success at work decisiveness and communicating confidently are exactly those needed for dating and are actually transferable
295544 too many men think theyre brad pitt in search of a jennifer aniston but what i see opposite me is sometimes more like johnny vegas so a few home truths may be necessary but once you accept your limitations we can work around them
295545 to begin with why not just go over and say hi youd be amazed how many people dont take that simple initiative and exude confidence even if youre faking it
295546 this accounts for 55 per cent of social interaction but many people men especially cant read the signals or unconsciously transmit negative ones i teach people to interpret body language and be aware of their own so they can learn to modify it
295547 opinions should be formed with great caution and changed with greater
295548 weve seen these types of worms before typically around myspace

295550 we could not serve you properly today because your recyclable trash was not property sorted please remember to sort all recyclables into their proper containers so we may serve you properly
295551 the main objective there is the pursuit of al qaida to remove them from their hideouts there and continue to keep them off balance
295552 mosul is a piece of valuable real estate for al qaida
295553 they want to hold on to mosul because its their entryway to syria and it facilitates a lot of the flow of foreign fighters and money to finance al qaida
295554 in anbar theres still a viable lethal al qaida threat
295555 and that is really the focus of the security forces out there
295556 thats a key security issue that we cant take our eye off and that we have got to continue to focus on another one would be the structured continued process of turning over security for provinces to the iraqi government that would be a good thing to watch and were making good progress on that
295557 five hundred and sixty five voter registration centers are open people are registering to vote
295558 i am very encouraged by the fact that speaker mashadani has called them in
295559 theyre going to wrestle with it on sunday all parties really i think have an interest in solving this now because as they move forward with the elections and as they move forward with solving the kirkuk issue its going to be very beneficial to the country in terms of moving forward economic development
295560 the people are by and large rejecting the violence whether its al qaida or iranian backed special groups this indiscriminate violence thats killing innocent iraqis
295561 the iraqis have really out of hand rejected that and are not supporting any elements that really participated in that
295562 its very encouraging time now that were kind of shifting into the political and economical development phase of the counterinsurgency
295563 the reason for the fighting is local animosities influenced by people who feel they are not getting their share of the redevelopment
295564 development dampens the insurgency as evidenced in improving the police the roads connecting the people to the government and the promising health care system
295565 a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
295566 straighten up act like a man dont sit there crying and screaming idiot
295567 we build the formation and then push it out to the operational force
295568 nine of those are currently at some level of existence and there are five others being built
295569 we train between 11 000 and 15 000 in every training cycle
295570 iraqi soldiers do five weeks of training graduate and then move to a unit
295571 we are building 14 division training centers to add to that capability
295572 last month we pulled a battalion out of the 9th iraqi division and ran them through what would be similar to an american combat training center program
295573 this is challenging given the operational tempo of the force to pull a unit off the line but the iraqis are very excited about this and we think it has a lot of potential to enhance the professional development of the military
295574 many iraqi soldiers cannot read and write but the army is putting in place courses that iraqi soldiers can take to improve their education
295575 when the convening authority reviewed those facts and circumstances they made the determination that they were such that they wanted to authorize they felt it appropriate that a panel have the death penalty as an available punishment
295576 while approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander in chief the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted
295577 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
295578 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
295579 one of benefits of human cloning we were told would be the ability to clone someone with a disease like als to obtain stem cells from the embryo for disease study
295580 indeed before he decided to abandon cloning in favor of ipscs that is precisely what ian wilmut had a license to do in the uk
295581 well so far no human cloned embryonic stem cells have been derived despite years of trying
295582 but in less than one year since the first ipsc human line was created that precise achievement has already been accomplished
295583 a political party cannot be all things to all people
295584 senator clinton has long been a supporter of emilys list and encouraging women to run for congress
295585 this is going to be a great year from women we have a fantastic class of women running for congress senate and the governors office
295586 talking about how gop presidential nominee john mccain is obviously not the choice for women who care about things like pay equity and choice
295587 this special event held on the 88th anniversary of womens suffrage will celebrate democratic women as we come together for victory at the democratic national convention
295588 senator clinton has long been a supporter of emilys list and encouraging women to run for congress
295589 this is going to be a great year from women we have a fantastic class of women running for congress senate and the governors office
295590 a political party cannot be all things to all people
295591 this is going to be a great year from women
295592 the burns looked like they were a week and a half old it looked like a small infection had begun
295593 the main thing you are trying to prevent on a burn is infection or any type of external debris sticking to it
295594 the best thing to do is put dry sterile gauze on the wound
295595 i came back because i got a job here to help both the iraqis and americans supporting the war on terrorism
295596 its always good to help the iraqis to know whats going on and what they are going through
295597 we are dealing with very basic medications here but we are helping at least 60 to 70 percent of the population
295598 basically what we try to do is give them our advice if we cant treat them here go see a specialist
295599 others we give medication especially for those who havent seen a doctor in years and dont have access to medical care when they get the antibiotics and painkillers i think it will be great for them in the long run
295600 for me there is no greater reward to be able to help somebody put a smile on somebodys face
295601 if he obama moved to the center on abortion a knowledgeable religion journalist remarked to me last week he could win half of evangelicals under 40
295602 this proposed sale would advance iraqs effort to develop a strong well equipped trained and dedicated military force to establish security and stability throughout iraq and to promote the stability and development of a friendly democratic central government
295603 an extremist who has built his empire on the backs of gays and lesbians
295604 it is an affront for the radio hall of fame to honor james dobson a right wing demagogue
295605 the focus on the family broadcast was created as and remains a means of helping families thrive
295606 if you were to analyze the content of our 32 years of broadcasts only a minuscule number deal with public policy issues and an infinitesimal number deal with homosexuality
295607 often creates large numbers of fans devoted to their favourite personalities and the number of votes cast in 2008 increased significantly
295608 an extremist who has built his empire on the backs of gays and lesbians
295609 it is an affront for the radio hall of fame to honor james dobson a right wing demagogue
295610 a political party cannot be all things to all people
295611 and now for another action packing episode of sodomites on parade youll recall that last week our hero mr wayne king was fired from his job at the fudge packing plant causing a rift between wayne king and his co worker michael hunt hugh jass the supervisor just couldnt quite put his finger on the problem that had been itching away at the base of the friendship that the three shared
295612 listen we ought to call our pal and let him know that we care
295613 yeah the thing is im sure there are going to be lots of surprises and i dont know what they are and they always make me nervous
295614 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him
295615 the purpose of god is that through the conditions and sufferings of my life should develop in me the features of his son on the one hand the features of the old creation may be seen to be more and more terrible and horrible as i recognize them in myself but over against that god is doing something which is other than my old self he is bringing into being another altogether other and that is his son my new life slowly seemingly all too slowly nevertheless something is developing the sonship is not very much in evidence yet but it is going to be manifested what god has been doing will come out into the light eventually conformity to the image of his son
295616 afflictions are in the hands of the holy spirit to effect the softening of the heart in order to receive heavenly impression job said job 23 16 as the wax in its natural hard state cannot take the impress of the signet and needs to be melted to render it susceptible so the believer is by trials prepared to receive and made to bear the divine likeness
295617 if in the course of taxation that the people are upset let them have toys of a carnal nature this right shall not be infringed those who serve the people in congress are to be given a artificial phallus to be measured to the size of their ego and to which they may use it to screw over americans
295618 sen barack obamas ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
295619 where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools
295620 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
295621 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
295622 now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake
295623 if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war
295624 we are stronger than before and when hizbollah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war we dont seek war but we must be ready
295625 israel didnt achieve any of its goals the known goal of israel is death to hizbollah hizbollah is still here
295626 on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
295627 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
295628 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
295629 they were involved in an altercation at the airport in the departure lounge
295630 he continued to live the lifestyle of a grad student no frills
295631 were looking at a man with a distinguished 30 something year career unparalleled and known around the world
295632 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
295633 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
295634 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
295635 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens
295636 its not like you might say the person gave off vibes that they might be a dangerous person
295637 despite the challenges facing all banks today the current environment also presents opportunities for strong institutions like suntrust to expand our client base
295638 right now consumers would rather postpone the decision than make a decision on a car purchase
295639 theyre suspicious about whats happening in the economy and they dont want to make a big ticket purchase
295640 we might see some improvement when the 09 models start hitting showrooms but its not going to make up for these losses its not going to be until 2010 models start arriving more than a year from now that were likely to start seeing any significant recovery in the market
295641 it was amazing it was truly like the peoples house
295642 first we cant vote for this now we cant talk about it
295643 the new direction congress led by democrats has offered real solutions to bring down energy costs promote renewable fuels and energy efficiency and promote oil production right here in america but a majority of congressional republicans have voted no each time
295644 they should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses
295645 when we started this campaign we were hoping for a more elevated debate i mean imagine at a time when we face more challenges than at any time in our lifetime these guys are running ads with paris and britney
295646 its a sign that they dont have anything to offer to the american people so theyre just going to try to call folks names like you did in 5th grade
295647 you remember that back in 5th grade you know peopled be calling each other names and getting into these petty fights we dont have time for that
295648 18 months ago when i announced nobody gave us a shot we didnt have the establishment in washington behind us we didnt have all the big lobbyists and pacs and money behind us
295649 but what we had that they didnt understand was the people the spirit of ordinary americans who wanted to bring about change thats always been our secret weapon thats always been the magic ingredient in this campaign you
295650 through victories and defeats you guys have stuck with us and youve been there and youve made phone calls and youve talked to friends and youve had to defend you know my positions and explain to people you know those emails are wrong
295651 theres just stuff youve had to do because you understand whats at stake
295652 not only is he one of the best senators we have nicest man you ever want to meet but the guy was an astronaut that is cool
295653 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
295654 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
295655 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
295656 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
295657 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
295658 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
295659 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
295660 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
295661 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
295662 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
295663 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
295664 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
295665 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
295666 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
295667 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
295668 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
295669 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
295670 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
295671 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
295672 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
295673 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
295674 me recibieron bien en mi tierra puerto rico tuve un gran encuentro con la prensa de mi pa s que ha destacado a la teleserie como una de las mejores que se transmiten ah
295675 es un buen momento para las teleserie a nivel internacional y vienen m s para m xico
295676 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one
295677 a light will shine down from somewhere it will light upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
295678 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
295679 barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jump start our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
295680 clever quakers are going to make it easier for all of us to know when weve got the disease pb still remembers asking a physician colleague years ago how the diagnosis is confirmed by cutting open someones head and examining it after death was the response
295681 but what about different sizes of headlines how to distinguish the stories in importance rather than just sticking the latest at the top
295682 the fluidity of interface and the breadth of its content
295683 the video feeds are refreshingly fast and the full page of photos is a fun little gem
295684 teorie del cinema 1945 1990 les th ories du cin ma depuis 1945
295685 ce livre se r f re une id e de la th orie du cin ma aussi loign e de labstraction celle de ceux qui voudraient que cette th orie soit ce quelle na jamais t que de la complaisance celle de ceux qui en trouvent des traces dans tout discours intelligent
295686 ce qui donne de la profondeur ces discours ce nest pas toutefois telle ou telle forme quils peuvent prendre mais leur capacit exprimer une hypoth se dot e dune certaine coh rence son vidence sa n cessit et surtout qui soit partag e ou puisse l tre par un groupe de chercheurs
295687 the language of relativism projects power by raising doubt or casting uncertainty where none existed before
295688 just one correction nora hoppe is indeed from the us but has lived and worked in europe for many years and all her films were shot in europe she is currently is based in berlin i myself am british despite having made a western in canada painted angels 1999 and live in london
295689 im always in favor of film magazines because i dont think that daily criticism can contribute a lot to real film criticism
295690 if you want to screen this blockbuster you have to also play my other cheap movies
295691 so why review them why not let the market do its work let the audience have its fun and occupy ourselves with the arcana the art we critics ostensibly prefer the obvious answer is that art or at least the kind of pleasure wonder and surprise we associate with art often pops out of commerce and we want to be around to celebrate when it does and to complain when it doesnt but the deeper answer is that our love of movies is sometimes expressed as a mistrust of the people who make and sell them and even of the people who see them we take entertainment very seriously which is to say that we dont go to the movies for fun or for money we do it for you
295692 to start compromising yourself in terms of the industry to start worrying about that letter youre going to get from the filmmaker or from the distributors thats the beginning of the end
295693 i think this personality of the producer coming and saying
295694 nonetheless one must strive for an ethical standard in on line publishing and not let the moral slippery slide begin that slippery slide is usually inaugurated in the film magazine business by one thing money and most particularly advertising the moment you allow advertising onto a site you have bought into compromise can you be truly critical any longer of those distributors exhibitors or publishers who are helping to subsidise your site it is better and certainly ethically easier to fudge ones critical opinions to keep powerful friends to hold open the sources of precious revenue institutional support such as might come from a government arts body a university a council a cine club association or a special public fund can sometimes come with necessary conditions to promote a national or local cinema for instance which can be debated deflected or subverted advertising money however comes with the pulverising force of capital and its sole aim which is to sell to expand itself and to win passive social consent this is one of the most socially and politically responsible things that a publication can do resist complicity with the system the industry the establishment it is easy to be idealistic about this but idealism often corrodes quickly in a difficult material world there is so much pressure one way or another to conform to the film industry to cover only those latest films which the commercial industry wants you to see to engage only in the kind of discourse pro or con that greases the wheels of the mass movie going system to overlook what the cinema of the past has been or what truly alternative cinema is today
295695 the latter ethic was overwhelmingly embraced by media outlets during the reagan era exemplified by the sly shift from reporting on movies to featuring inside industry coverage
295696 four or five films up for review on his weekly tv show
295697 nowadays the line between journalism and publicity is often blurred and one common systematic method of blurring it is the movie junket
295698 on sassoit que dis je on senfonce en douceur dans des fauteuils m lleux en cuir ces fauteuils de nabab invitation autant que pi ge gaffe lassoupissement voil lun des privil ges de la projo
295699 the argentine writer director makes few narrative concessions to the impatient viewer steeping auds in a highly personal view of a bewildering new environment whose richly detailed sights and sounds furnish their own brand of engrossing drama
295700 that history of cinema will force those critics refusing the role of under paid cheerleaders to themselves become historians not to mention archivists bricoleurs spoilsports pundits entrepreneurs anti conglomerate guerilla fighters and in general masters of what is known in the enchanted palace as counter programming
295701 pauline kael and andrew sarris were battling over different ways to read movies sarris was the more learned and academic he was really an historian kael was a popularizer and passionate advocate and wrote far more entertaining prose
295702 as the technologies of filmmaking and distribution continue to proliferate criticism must also develop in ways that are commensurate with its object in order to effectively respond
295703 under the form of an interview for the italian online journal cinemascope it so his concern for the topic at hand cannot be questioned though i wish he had brought up today the same kind of insights he had written on last year
295704 could you just tell me if any of the issues i brought up in my post please note i only talked about the topic in general not yet about specific quotes cited by kevin were addressed in the panels
295705 its common knowledge among most in the conference crowd so why spend much time on it
295706 if you want to express yourself in those media outlets then you must learn to be wise about it
295707 he dint need to visit america to talk about america
295708 why the average american audience the one buying the most tickets would systematically prefer to watch a hollywood version to a comparable foreign film of the same genre
295709 i cant concentrate on both the subtitles and the image
295710 id rather just listed to a dubbed version than a subtitled version
295711 total screens in the world 2005 149 083 2 734 from 2004
295712 in recent years some of the studios art house subsidiaries have been moving away from acquisition and toward financing and production
295713 most foreign language film releases are done by small companies hoping to squeak by on wafer thin profit margins or awards oriented releases that probably lose money
295714 there is a definite barrier in the audience against seeing films with subtitles
295715 but there are exceptions to the rule that were able to cross over
295716 foreign language movies are not a genre per se there are varieties of films that have another selling point that allow them to throw off the shackles of a foreign language and do box office way in excess of the norm
295717 which means that the pie which may actually be growing is cut into smaller pieces
295718 peoples internal resistance to subtitles is partly that they think it means a good for you festival art film
295719 we didnt sell pans labyrinth as a spanish language subtitled film pure storytelling and visuals trumped any other issues theres been a lot of progress made
295720 where is going cinema criticism situation and perspectives of a practice
295721 the relation between cinema criticism and the internet from the revue to the blog
295722 what occurred to me this morning is that maybe we underestimate a the incredible amount of data available in even the simplest work of art and b the minds ability to find strong coherent patterns in even a small collection of data so for instance i come to kubrick with a particular heightened aversion to a certain acting style which is connected to a certain personality trait i identify this element am ticked off by it and calibrate my perceptive apparatus so that i start picking up any other element with some aspect in common because there is so much data in a movie i have no trouble finding lots of support for my initial aversion and in discarding the occasional data point that doesnt fit what im looking for within minutes voila i have constructed a coherent kubrick pattern that i call a sensibility meanwhile other observers without the same baseline aversion that i have not only construct a different kubrick pattern but also lack a slot in their kubrick pattern to help them identify the traits that look obvious to me
295723 i dont attempt to construct a personality for an auteur im looking for something else when i look at
295724 the problem is that if and when these films welles the other side of the wind see the light of day they will not be received well by critics because they arent what people are looking for from welles
295725 language barrier may lead to misunderstanding oversimplifying caricaturization false characterisation cultural blindness missed in joke humour double entendre local cultural references innuendos regional accents
295726 is it possible or even desirable for film criticism to be free from personal bias
295727 i have a secret can you guess what it is
295728 the tension relies on a huis clos setting single location drama
295729 cinema is the only art that is both an art of space and time
295730 either because it adopts new values through its arrangement with other images
295731 thus generates a new reality cinema language detached from its reality of origin the real world filmed by the camera
295732 of space and time inside the frame of the picture the filmic image cancels out the reality it is the image of it
295733 there are plenty of american films that dont fall into the
295734 according to gardels and medavoy the fact that films now gross more abroad than at home suggests that the american public is tired of these big pictures the rising proportion of receipts abroad results largely from reasons other than any putative decline in the popularity of american cinema for one thing rising prosperity in developing countries has made movie going more affordable and hence there are more movie goers the fall of communism and the new profit orientation in china have opened large new markets for american films most crucially a huge boom in the construction of multiplexes in south america europe and much of asia during the 1990s and early 2000s raised the number and cost of tickets sold outside the us it isnt the american market that has shrunk its the foreign market that has expanded moreover comparisons between the total box office income of films within the american market and in foreign ones are often misleading due to currency fluctuations the recent weakness of the american dollar against many other currencies has made it considerably easier for those in other countries to see hollywoods products theatrical income does not necessarily reflect the number of tickets sold or the price of those tickets in local currencies hence raw statistics may not accurately indicate the actual popularity of any given title
295735 american films are truly international products and blockbusters play in most foreign markets a non english language market like denmark may produce films that gain considerable screen time at home but they do not circulate outside the country on nearly the scale of the american product
295736 the english language however remains central to most internationally successful films and that is unlikely to change any time soon the most popular stars still tend to come from english speaking countries or to be able to speak english well as actors like juliette binoche and pen lope cruz can
295737 when a huge complex production like the lord of the rings can be almost entirely made in a country with a miniscule production history there is far less reason for american producers to confine any phase of their projects to the traditional capital of filmmaking
295738 there may indeed be an ongoing decline in hollywoods importance in world cinema but it isnt happening quickly for one thing there is no reason to think that us firms will soon cease to be the main sources of financing and organization of filmmaking
295739 the clergy are like manure excellent when spread all over the country while doing their work but when gathered together in a heap they stink

295744 we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn liverpool manager rafa benitez said of the trip to belgium
295745 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect we know some things about their team already but we will now watch more videos and get reports from our scouts before the first game
295746 yes we have to be in the group stage but we have to fight for it begiristain told the associated press
295747 we will be in krakow watching the second leg of the wisla vs beitar game and we will know a little more about the teams we must give all respect to both teams

295986 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
295987 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
295988 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
295989 its pure tryout for me make a team or leave

295992 hes very upset about all the accusations and he would like to have his day in court
295993 we havent completed our investigation into where all of the pills came from because there are so many of them
295994 we do plan on making contact with the actual owners of these prescription pills
295995 and dave is just another example of her impeccable taste
295996 eric you punk you didnt say please to your mom
295997 well hes a punk too but he made me this drink so i cant really call him one
295998 a good tough bike ride just the kind he likes hes fine
295999 if i pass away please bury me with my cell phone
296000 ok you come to lagos first i want to tell you something very important
296001 it s not true we spoke yesterday she still calls me
296002 the one that interested me the most was why dont we america build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
296003 no hay malos manejos y en su momento el secretario de finanzas estatal dar respuesta puntual al proceso administrativo que corresponde en la justificaci n del uso de esos recursos
296004 i believe unfortunately rhoda mcfarland was in the wrong place at the wrong time
296005 i dont believe that any church squabble could have led to anything like this
296006 one day she called me and asked me to move her stuff out of the church
296007 i spoke to her one time i invited her to come back to the church to pray for her and bless her and have her leave with peace and not anger out the back door
296008 something was happening inside the church that she didnt approve of and she wanted to leave
296009 weve talked to detectives offered to let them look at our books and they declined
296010 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
296011 if better material was used it would at least not turn into rubble like this
296012 i had assumed as had everyone else that the men on board were all british
296013 nobody had considered a naval vessel would have a huge foreign component to it which is a little shocking
296014 the reason the mary rose sank is because there was very poor communication between the crew because you have this really large foreign contingent and they probably did make a bad manoeuvre and that was probably the reason the ship sank
296015 they were involved in a lot of moving around and there was trade and particular nationalities were fighting as mercenaries for different countries
296016 the spanish part surprises me a little bit because spain and britain generally did not get on
296017 the nato summit conference briefing materials were not adequately safeguarded
296018 genuinely had no idea what documents she was referring to
296019 since investigators were not able to interview ms couillard the investigation could not determine the circumstances by which she came into possession of the classified documents
296020 the incident itself was injurious to the national interest by tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
296021 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does said singh who was at 7 under 133
296022 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
296023 its anybodys ball game said hunter mahan who had a 66 and was at 3 under 137
296024 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th lonard said with a laugh
296025 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter singh said
296026 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
296027 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
296028 i didnt want to bogey the last two mickelson said
296029 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
296030 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before he said
296031 do i like free stuff do i enjoy supporting indie film do i like helping my fellow man do i want to rock
296032 mr galloway is the founding member of the respect party and is prominent in denouncing racism and discrimination and has no anti semitic or racist views
296033 in poor third world countries like pakistan politics is too important to be left to petty squabbling politicians
296034 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
296035 andas caminado mirando hacia todos lados cuidando de por d nde te va a llegar la bala

296040 everybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide he must be the anthrax killer
296041 that is a lousy premise the pressure of these f b i investigations on individuals is phenomenal and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings
296042 con este banco de informaci n se brindar n elementos para el inicio y seguimiento de la denuncia adem s de que ser una herramienta valiosa para las agencias del ministerio p blico dado que permitir avanzar para identificar y tener detalles de los rasgos del generador de la violencia
296043 im just like whats it gonna be corny takes the kids on a uso tour in nam tracy goes to nam and edna joins the black panthers wilbur f s a grieving jackie o
296044 because its john waters it could be very original and very fun
296045 obviously the coffeehouse is part of the church but people wont be preached to there
296046 i feel like if most people come in theyll realize we dont have a hidden agenda
296047 we just wanted to make this a really warm friendly place
296048 and its so close to campus so hopefully people come in to hang out
296049 i think its going to be a good place for people to connect with the community
296050 we were pleased with kevin he addressed the things we needed to focus on as we moved forward
296051 i feel we come in every year as a contender and this year is no different hopefully we will take care of business in our pre conference tournaments and thatll make a big difference in our seeding in the ncaa tournament i think our serving and passing will be really strong this year our offense should be tremendous if we stay healthy were pretty solid all around and weve improved defensively
296052 we are confident of further tender success in the near future
296053 he is pretty broken up but was conscious and talking
296054 suffolk cambridgeshire and peterborough pcts have been asked to consider and report to the sha on reasons for a significant variance from trajectory
296055 we aim to reduce the number of infections to the lowest possible level and we are very close to achieving the target
296056 we investigate every case to see if it was avoidable and to find out how we can learn from what happened as a result we have had a new antibiotic prescribing policy in place since june
296057 our goal for the future is that not a single preventable infection is allowed to develop
296058 our target for c difficile infections for 2008 09 is challenging as it is significantly lower than the targets we were set last year we are slightly above our year to date target for c difficile infections and investigations are ongoing as to why this is the case every case is thoroughly investigated to ascertain where and how the patient became infected
296059 i missed the birth of my own daughter because i was in prison and my partner warned me that if i ever went to prison again she would take the children and go
296060 after the committees decision we hoped we would have more time and they could have allowed us to stay
296061 we would have liked more notice as well about five or six people have nowhere to go
296062 we always intended to move the group on we have gone through all the proper processes and legal steps what happened yesterday was a part of that process
296063 we are relieved that councillors have rejected this latest application
296064 we have had to review the scheme since the wellcome trust decided not to be involved but we are keen to press ahead with it
296065 it is still viable the site is surrounded by three major roads and in my view it is a logical place to build a settlement
296066 a mix of community facilities shops employment areas restaurants cafes a bus interchange and central park a secondary school is located nearby and to the north and south there are two smaller centres to ensure there are convenient shops community facilities and primary schools
296067 hanley grange will feature new wetlands and ecological areas with green spaces and pedestrian routes bus services will be provided and an express service will link hanley grange to the southern end of the cambridge guided bus network
296068 the plan integrates social economic and environmental elements to ensure the development is supported by the physical infrastructure required
296069 this is bullying pure and simple the scare mongering nature of the comments he cllr edwards has made to describe the potential cuts is in no way balanced or thoughtful and seem to us to be designed to frighten tenants into voting for transfer come what may
296070 furthermore there appears to be no evidence base whatsoever for any of this
296071 cllr edwards should be warned that tenants are not going to agree to sacrifice their secure tenancies which in law only councils can grant to risk higher rents housing association rents in south cambs are 11 per cent higher than council rents and to lose the accountability of local authority control
296072 south cambs against transfer has issued a leaflet to all tenants and we have been inundated with responses in support of our campaign including donations for further newsletters
296073 i took my family to the pool on sunday and as we were queuing to get in there was a gang of about half a dozen boys not more than 15 who were hanging around
296074 they were really very threatening and were swearing at people especially one man who had told them to go away
296075 we did call the police in the end after my wife heard one of the boys threatening to rape one of the women in the queue
296076 the problem is there is no cctv in the complex and people are afraid to step in for fear of themselves being accused of doing something wrong
296077 we have had a lot of problems with large gangs of youths this year the problems are not only here they are also occurring at sheeps green
296078 last weekend we called the police in relation to an incident with a gang of boys who had been banned the previous day
296079 there is often trouble with large groups of youngsters on hot days and the police are busy on those days too making it difficult to get someone down to the pool if there are problems
296080 we have considered putting in cctv but the nature of it being a swimming pool means there are people who are scantily clad and there is a fine line between protection and invasion of privacy
296081 we have even considered having security guards but who wants a security guard around when all you are doing is going for a swim
296082 a woman was shouting that her daughter was still inside and i decided to swim across the vehicle was completely submerged and other people had jumped in we struggled for five minutes or maybe longer then we struggled onto the bank
296083 someone said she is seatbelted in and i cant open the doors
296084 last night i was getting ready to go to sleep and thinking about today and different things about the racing and what im going to be looking for out of my race car
296085 you have the typical song and dance sequences that every bollywood flick has and if you ask me they are never required
296086 you have the typical song and dance sequences that every bollywood flick has and if you ask me they singh is great because he is an intellectual and understands modern economy
296087 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
296088 we have been blocked since 2003 the fact that our web site is unblocked is very good news
296089 for the overwhelming majority of internet users in china this doesnt mean anything
296090 chinese users are too busy enjoying the internet they have to lament the one they dont have

296095 in the may and june revenue numbers georgia really started to feel the economic conditions that are prevalent around the country
296096 this is not unlike what georgia families are doing theyre seeing their budgets strained as well
296097 the speaker and house leadership are actively working with the governors office and the senate to best manage the states fiscal affairs
296098 the speaker believes the governor in consultation with the legislature can effectively manage this budget challenge in a reasonable and systematic way through administrative steps
296099 were not saying for sure theyre going to be zeroed out but as for right now were not going to disperse that money because we cant call it back
296100 its the problem of trying to balance a billion dollar plus deficit and just depending on budget cuts
296101 its going to have a negative effect ton some of the most vulnerable citizens
296102 a political celebrity mccain is considered a top contender for the nomination
296103 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
296104 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
296105 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
296106 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
296107 were worried about being in the chase we think about it every week
296108 i dont think anybody was happy with it the drivers the fans the teams nascar
296109 we were probably running only 70 of top speed when we blew that tire along with everybody else
296110 the tire wasnt putting rubber down it was turning to dust and not laying on the race track and not merging with the asphalt
296111 we need to find out why the tire rubber would not lay into the track
296112 no one knew we had a problem until the end of the first practice
296113 to be perfectly honest with you i find it fun when things are challenging
296114 the challenge was how to manage the tires that we have so it was something different and sometimes thats fun
296115 the outlook for the uk economy has worsened as 2008 has progressed and the degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased there is a risk that the current economic and market turbulence could continue for a significant period of time and a risk of further uncertainty and contagion impacting the valuation of alliance amp leicester
296116 the proposal provided greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
296117 as with abbey in the early part of this century small banks lacking the skills set in capital markets are the ones being hurt most by credit events first half earnings at alliance amp leicester were almost completely wiped out by treasury losses as well as the expensive funding facility we fear this will mean a repeat performance at bradford amp bingley reporting on august 29
296118 the potential read across to bradford amp bingley particularly with respect to margins does not look good
296119 if david is so interested in the domestic agenda and attacking the tories then this is the perfect job for him
296120 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we have not been treated unfairly we are not doing well enough and thats what the voters have said
296121 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
296122 the decision has been made based on medical grounds unfortunately its not the outcome people would want but its the right decision for the animal
296123 its sick and distressed and it has come in for a second time it has chosen to strand both times we now know its not a navigational error but it has stranded for a reason
296124 its pure snobbery however good a horsewoman i may be im also a glamour model that embarrassed the organisers
296125 eliza doolittle went to the races with henry higgins after a few elocution lessons in pretty woman julia roberts went to the polo straight from sunset boulevard but in the 21st century we have become even more class ridden unless you are a toff or an aspiring actress they dont want you
296126 polo should be for people who love horses not a media charade it should be about the sport horses are a wonderful hobby one that gets you outside and keeps you fit they should be for everyone little girls glamour girls working class girls like me no one should be excluded
296127 there are some facts that have been misrepresented chinawhite didnt ever receive any money from katie the claim that we took her money and then decided she wasnt good enough just isnt true
296128 shes also saying she gave us 6 000 but tables only cost 5 000 she gave the money to a third party to book a table for her and they were unsuccessful because the tables were already sold out theyre clearly going to rip her off a grand so i hope she gets a refund
296129 this guy just took a knife out and started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
296130 he must have stabbed him 50 or 60 times there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
296131 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock
296132 then he tried to drive off but the bus driver disabled the bus somehow from the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
296133 we were watching zorro the next thing i know i hear someone screaming
296134 by the time the police had arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
296135 at 1 28 am the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in custody
296136 he has a lot of friends all very upset hes gone
296137 they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
296138 barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer we wish the police the best of luck in finding the real perpetrator
296139 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends
296140 however we respect the decision of the court the investigation was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
296141 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
296142 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
296143 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
296144 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
296145 i felt this year we were destabilised by some clubs who did not completely respect the fair play rules in tapping up players
296146 i feel we suffered from that at the end of the season there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players they think they can just come in and take them they offer the players big wages and after they cannot come up with the transfer request they should do it the other way around
296147 when we started talking about my contract i never told wenger id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
296148 if we can do one more signing we will but it will need to be the requested quality
296149 its not just a question of whether to buy its getting the right person and that is at the moment very difficult its not a real problem because we have enough young players who can step in weve lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it if not we will give this position to somebody else
296150 when you have many young players you cant keep them all bentley wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role but i felt he wasnt ready he would be ready today
296151 im very confident we have a squad to compete at the top level in the premier league the speculation before the season starts is always against us but we have enough strength to deal with that last year we lost the championship by four points and we feel we have been very very very unlucky this year we want to make another step forward and challenge even more and then win the championship
296152 it will take a few days for the dust to settle
296153 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of nuclear power stations
296154 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
296155 a push for more nuclear power would scupper the uk renewable energy industry and by doing so cancel out the prospect of creating hundreds of thousands of british green collar jobs
296156 specifically we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure staff do not initiate or spread false rumours
296157 there is no doubt false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on march 19 and these would have had some impact on the share price it is difficult to say how much as the share price was affected by other factors
296158 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
296159 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors we shouted for them rescue teams to save us
296160 its not going to get any more pressurised than playing in the last round of the us open with tiger woods given everything that was going on with his knee and trying to win the tournament as well i have tried to carry on the confidence that i built up there into this event
296161 whether tiger plays or not has no bearing on how i feel in any particular week
296162 obviously we all know hes got a fabulous record here but theres not much point in talking about a player thats not playing
296163 by wednesday this week i couldnt stand to see my face or hear my voice
296164 i know that seeing so much of my work can be a very emotional experience
296165 but the emotions not all bad im not a victim to everything i want people to feel the highs and lows the bed was fantastic and seminal the tent was seminal but there are other kinds of work and there is a lot of hard work involved in this art the blankets for instance are all really hard work and they are not all about me this show is a chance for people to see another side of me and my work
296166 come unto me every time i feel love i think christ im going to be crucified so i close my eyes and i become the cross so beautifull sic
296167 when im having sex and being fucked and i disappear into the ether and its amazing i feel like i am being crucified and it makes me feel of jesus and how he is supposed to represent love when you really feel love for someone you go to another place and that level of ecstasy could be heaven theres nothing blasphemous about it its absolutely genuine making love and being in love are just fantastic it should happen more often
296168 we had one decapitation some time ago but nothing like this
296169 i dont even know how many times i stabbed her
296170 it was more than once i only stopped when she was dead
296171 i had to get rid of the body quickly the only way out was to cut her up wasnt it it was just like cutting a piece of meat
296172 we dont have any information yet about what exactly she was doing here in brazil
296173 but she knew lots of brazilians from london and she always said that she would like to live in brazil because of the weather london is much colder than it is here and she was curious
296174 he is a drug user and he was always under the effect of drugs and he became very aggressive
296175 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
296176 i dragged her body into the bathroom then i put the body to one side and i got into the shower and washed then i locked the apartment and went out to the party
296177 she doesnt seem like the kind of girl who would have died without a fight
296178 she was a cool girl with a good heart and like all adolescents she had her crazy side
296179 we have asked the police liaison officer to contact the brazilian embassy and get things speeded up
296180 clinging to its hill like a tipsy man to a lamp post
296181 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident waiting to happen
296182 this is a basic service it is unbelievable that we are just being cut off
296183 i dont see how i can continue to work from home what business is going to come and set up here if they cant be sure theyll get their post
296184 this is the thin end of the wedge for remote communities everywhere and it must be stopped it raises real concerns for all our rural services
296185 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
296186 and i have no idea how many guns are here crime is spiking all over the caribbean these homicides here with young people involved they are usually drug related
296187 guns are in the wrong hands and these people have become trigger happy
296188 and i am in favour of the death penalty crack five necks and i believe many more will get the message
296189 i was brought down here to build a police force and we are finding a lot of good officers people who are intelligent and who want to work hard
296190 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
296191 they are really shocked as we all are we have all been through a traumatic experience
296192 they feel very much for their colleagues and friends and for those who are left back in the philippines who are now mourning the people who died were well known locally we feel for the loss of these fishermen everyone here is devastated
296193 it was extremely arduous conditions for the firefighters we had unconfirmed reports that there were people on board and then we heard there were at least two people there but during search and rescue operations our teams located three fatalities
296194 we are working to identify the three people and with the fire brigade we are working to establish where the fire started and how it started
296195 if you employ non eu nationals they use transit visas which means they embark upon a vessel they are going to work on and they stay there this is normal and natural practice
296196 there is no reason why they should not have been sleeping on board in fact its what they are supposed to do
296197 at one time there was a preference for crews to go ashore but on most vessels nowadays it has become more and more common practice to keep the crew on board
296198 these days the boats have all the facilities the electric is hooked up every boat has sky tv its own shower and toilet they have all the modern comforts
296199 foreign crew members prefer to cook their own meals because they eat differently from us they prefer to stay on the boat but they have to anyway
296200 they come here usually on eight month contracts and you can employ them only through an agency or they have to apply for an immigration visa
296201 i cant just phone up and ask them to work on my boat it has to be done through an agency which arranges the visas and everything and it is the agency that pays them
296202 my thoughts go out to the friends and family of those who died i am sure the police the fire and rescue service and the appropriate authorities will look very closely at the circumstances surrounding this and i hope we have a speedy understanding of what caused this tragedy
296203 i just think its really really sad for the families there is nowhere to go in such a confined space and the fumes would accumulate so quickly
296204 the owners of vision ii are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic events earlier today all our thoughts at this time are with the families of those who lost their lives
296205 this is a terrible tragedy and our sympathies go to the families involved there will obviously be an investigation and we will see if there are any lessons to be learned
296206 i would say the majority have filipinos on board it isnt just in the north east there is a boat from the south west of scotland in the harbour which has filipinos aboard
296207 we provide so many crew members in that area the uk we are not the only agency but i think we provide most of them i just hope they are not our people
296208 many filipinos have grown up with fishing their fathers were fishermen it is their life
296209 the overseas filipino workers earn much more abroad than they would at home they are the backbone of the economy the workers keep the country running its not only in scotland but all over the world especially in the middle east
296210 we all know i havent scored the runs so far this year in test cricket and of course you feel under a lot of pressure
296211 not so much from the outside but from knowing you have to contribute and feeling youre letting the team down when you dont
296212 professional sport is a tough industry when youre not doing your job and as a batsman youve got to go out and score runs and i havent been doing that
296213 he said something important to me before i went out to bat dont be reckless but be aggressive i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper to go out there and take the bowlers on thats how i play my best cricket
296214 but i played a similar kind of innings then its not the first time ive been under that kind of pressure
296215 everyone realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and theyve been saying a score is just round the corner today proves that everyone is thrilled to bits for me but weve still got a massive job to do
296216 we certainly need a few more runs i think hopefully monty panesar will get a few to turn out there but well have to wait and see how long we can bat
296217 very very disappointing it simply wasnt good enough we played with emotional energy rather than intelligent energy but weve got a gift with the second new ball first thing and the games still on a knife edge hats off to colly though he was written off before this knock
296218 we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about
296219 you can set up the most brilliant plans in the world but you still have to execute them we wanted to have colly feeling outside off stump and he got off the mark pulling that said everything about our performance but he played unbelievably well under the pressure
296220 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
296221 we think the conversation has to be changed and that is when you engage with presidential candidates its not just about what they want to talk about its what we want to talk about
296222 obama supports proposals to raise top marginal rates paid by small business and families to raise tax rates on those with taxable incomes of more than 32 000 raise capital gains taxes raise taxes on dividends raise payroll taxes and raise estate taxes thats a whole lot of raising and for millions of families individuals and small businesses it will mean a lot less money to spend save and invest as they see fit
296223 sen mccains campaign continues to take the low road today with more dishonest attacks that have been proven false repeatedly by independent news outlets like factcheck org while sen mccains distortions say little about senator obamas plan to give 95 of families a 1 000 tax cut they speak volumes about a candidate willing to repeat attacks that are simply wrong
296224 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
296225 how can we keep the government we create from becoming a frankenstein that will destroy the very freedom we establish it to protect
296226 so when are we going to do something to actually bring down energy prices
296227 vi fastnade d r uppe vi kom inte ur hissen
296228 he said for 10 you could have gotten a half case
296229 four cans of natural light only cost 3 or 4
296230 then the suspect went to the kitchen got a big butcher knife and came back and stabbed him
296231 heres a guy who probably should stay in jail for the rest of his life
296232 were a good family we dont do anybody any harm
296233 were not really in a position to comment on what happened while the police are still investigating
296234 i would have to strain beyond the bounds of reason to find the plea agreement reasonable
296235 i want to make sure that you understand that this is about doing whats right and yahoo has done a lot since last shareholders meeting
296236 it feels like we have not communicated to you what weve done
296237 we think search is an important part of yahoo and we are going to invest in it
296238 there are some very important serious infrastructure and systems being built right now at yahoo that we think allows us to compete over time
296239 we think that we are the better operating company and we think were going to make it
296240 motion to secure financing on terms which require concessions is a blatant attempt to circumvent the strict requirements of federal law similar tactics have been rejected by bankruptcy courts and must be rejected in this case as well
296241 i cant speak to the specifics of the negotiations because we have a nondisclosure agreement
296242 new or revised collective bargaining agreements or amendments containing concessions necessary to meet labor cost reductions
296243 todays action by the fcc may actually result in slower online speeds for 95 percent of americas internet consumers
296244 although i have a tremendous amount of respect for each of my colleagues none of us has an engineering degree
296245 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
296246 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
296247 we recognize the efforts of our legislative heroes rep marilyn musgrave and rep john salazar in working to ensure there will be no expansion and no funding at pi on canyon
296248 the people of southeastern colorado have suffered for years as the army has switched from one study to the next one plan to the next and one map to the next

296251 it appeared that he had fallen or slipped and the gun discharged
296252 im not sure what he was planning to do either relocate the turtle or dispatch it
296253 i would imagine if you introduced ducks and snapping turtles the turtles are going to eat very well
296254 a wonderful guy a very well respected and well liked police officer if we ever needed a canine even though he was with bensalem he would always come out and try to help us
296255 were all heartbroken for his family he had his retirement to look forward to and had a beautiful piece of property that he loved
296256 from now on i am going to put my money in things that i can see and touch

296259 mike arrington blocked me and all i got was this t shirt
296260 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children
296261 now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
296262 its been a hell of a year and this is why
296263 on whose behalf was the cheque to be held and what happened to this money is there any significance that was in serious financial trouble
296264 why is the serious fraud office taking so long to find the answers to these questions
296265 nationals auckland regional conference is underway this weekend with the embarrassed party awkwardly trying to put a bitter internal row behind it and desperate to find anything to distract the media from the serious fraud office investigation into the partys funds the news that the sfo is investigating the partys finances specifically the mysterious amounts donated by merchant bankers fay richwhite in 1996 had recently prompted the party to call for sfo head david bradshaws resignation after he informed the prime ministers office that he was investigating national
296266 the partys president michelle boag former head of public relations at fay richwhite had threatened former president john slater with expulsion if it was found that he was the source of the leak about the partys 1996 funding to the sfo
296267 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages
296268 we spilled our berries its hot im thirsty i have to go to the bathroom how much longer how much longer how much
296269 i must have a word with the lord right this minute it is urgent ramone
296270 soceress leva what news do you have that makes such a brave soul stumble in my presence
296271 there is a disturbance with the hyjeata crystal i fear it is being hunted by the majark warriors a barrier has already been breached and broken
296272 this can not be those barriers are unbreakable where were my guards
296273 sire i smelt the blood of many guards guarding the hyjeata i fear one of the shards have been captured
296274 impossible there is only one man i know that could even breach the barriers
296275 this can not be i sealed him in the dungeon centuries ago that dungeon was unseekable
296276 seek these warriors out leva destory them leave no mercy i want every one of them to be dead and as for laren bring him to me i will not be so afraid to spill his blood now
296277 ive already been to paris and canada its time for some africa
296278 youre going to have to call your doctor to get malaria
296279 but they wont get away with this for long someday everyone will recognize what fools they are just as with jannes and jambres
296280 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
296281 if you want to stay alive you will accompany me and bring that half wit of an assassian brother you have
296282 why you dont look so familiar sunny whats your name are you from around here
296283 i reside in thorn mountains just north of here why dont you pass me an ale
296284 rumor has it the fire shard has already been captured but i wasnt the one to say so
296285 do not joke with me i do not take ease droppers so kindly
296286 athin is my name i reside in thorn mountains not too far from here i am but a wandering hunter for the dark lord
296287 ha well the lady knows no other i assume no one really knows much about her other than her power and relations to the dark lord tis said he took her in after king johent put out a contract for her parents tis said his highness knew the power that was store within the wee lass and couldnt have her against him
296288 gentleman must you act like children and what is this discussion
296289 you cant see the forest through the trees and you cant smell your own shit on your knees
296290 in history as in human life regret does not bring back a lost moment and a thousand years will not recover something lost in a single hour
296291 the bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone
296292 ah theres the ostrich did you know they can run up to 46 mph and could rip open your stomach with their feet despite their outer toe not having a nail
296293 so gorgeous did you know that we are 98 dna similar to monkeys
296294 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left
296295 oh martin how i love your blog humour intelligence emotion you need to be published anyways hows you im thinkin im glad i stayed in boxing day hopefully see you sometime before i return to the land of frogs xx
296296 if u wanna go left turn to page 53 if u wanna go right turn to page 64
296297 do you think i wouldnt see you cheating with a maths book in your hand are you that stupid
296298 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
296299 we discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else
296300 but this was discussed before the first heart transplant and in reality nobody really cared about that
296301 goed voor jezelf zorgen is het grootste geschenk dat je anderen kunt geven
296302 if you can imagine it you can have it this is the name of the game this is the lesson to learn it couldnt be any easier reality is not what your eyes show your mind but what your mind creates for your eyes to see you are not limited by logic the past or the world around you you are not even of the world around you you are supernatural pure spirit you came first magic miracles and luck are the consequences of understanding this the inevitable result of dreaming and acting in spite of appearances
296303 grande scemo chi ti ha detto che ti avrei detto di no
296304 no mi sono truccata oggi non voglio piangere suonami qualcosa di tuo
296305 no i had food i clubbed i had fresh dis fresh dats
296306 stop that train im leaving and it wont be long whether im right or wrong
296307 now the internet can be used freely as in all previous olympic games
296308 even though it decision makers clearly recognise the importance of green it solutions such as virtualisation and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organisation
296309 if going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable it to an organisation then widespread adoption may take some time
296310 all i ever wanted was the best for all you boys
296311 the growing number of high profile incidents in which customer records confidential information and intellectual property were leaked lost or stolen has created an explosive demand for dlp solutions
296312 this acquisition creates a great opportunity for mcafee to fulfill a critical need in this space
296313 the main cause for the chaos we see in muslim countries is the external factor the western interference in the 19th century they exploited and made muslims backward
296314 western countries chose to stay put even when we gained independence meddling in our economic and domestic affairs because they wanted to maintain their presence and exploit our natural resources
296315 islam teaches its followers to live peacefully with non muslims so its a question of occupation by these powers not a question of islam and the jews
296316 each of us takes our own path building a unity in views heavily relying on our own national interests
296317 we hope scholars can identify aggressions and can build a defense system against aggressions
296318 declare a clear stance against injustice by the western world
296319 recessions can be a good thing because legislation has made it almost impossible to sack staff and now there is an opportunity for people to get rid of dead wood
296320 we are hiring based on our visibility of where the market is going the niche we sit in is buoyant and is not reflecting a downturn
296321 our headcount is going to go up this year i believe it is a good time to recruit
296322 we need to stay one step ahead to beat the spammers and increasingly sophisticated botnet threats
296323 as businesses communicate by email we need to reclaim control of it before we can make commerce efficient and compliant
296324 companies still worry about losing important emails because of their anti spam measures
296325 the figures are worse when you consider that in many cases it was too early to judge whether the it installation was a success or failure
296326 letrex holdings was wound up under the provisions of the insolvency act 1986 this was the only course of action we could take given the debtors unwillingness to settle its liabilities and unwarranted strenuous efforts to deny liability under the contract
296327 the hearing took place without us even being there so we have asked for another date when we can attend in person and defend our case
296328 the impact that energy consumption has on climate change and the species and habitats that we look at supporting is quite a big deal for us and so is reducing power usage of our server operation
296329 we would not even dream of getting into the support requirements of running a 24 7 website infrastructure internally so we had to find a partner to take that support role the benefits apart from less power consumption are cost effectiveness and resilience due to the fact that systems run on a virtualised environment
296330 where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
296331 realising i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight where little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both caps
296332 the impact that energy consumption has on climate change and the species and habitats that we look at supporting is quite a big deal for us and so is reducing power usage of our server operation
296333 we would not even dream of getting into the support requirements of running a 24 7 website infrastructure internally so we had to find a partner to take that support role the benefits apart from less power consumption are cost effectiveness and resilience due to the fact that systems run on a virtualised environment
296334 patience is one of the characteristics of monastic life but even the patience of the brothers was tested by our slow internet
296335 broadband access has made a huge difference to our internet usage
296336 we knew we needed a faster connection but we had almost given up trying to find a workable solution which would give us an internet connection at speeds enjoyed by others on the mainland
296337 if you notice when youre outside in the heat and youre sweating a while and you stop sweating its very important you go inside it means you are very dehydrated
296338 from the way we understand it the more rest the better hell be
296339 there had been a lot of talk that i was going to be traded to a couple teams but i guess florida wanted me more its great to come over here on a winning team
296340 once you get traded you come over to a new team and you just got to come over and do what you do
296341 i think thats a big presence in the locker room
296342 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
296343 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
296344 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
296345 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
296346 i dont worry about him playing center like riding a bike
296347 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
296348 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
296349 its a little later than i wanted to be back but you gotta take their schedule and do what they want
296350 the chances of getting him back on september 1st is zero
296351 as long as hes healthy well throw him out there
296352 he was a big part of our bullpen before that dreaded day in chicago

296449 serina has not actually practiced tantric magic not with a partner anyway however we are treated to a bit of tmi when she mentions shes tried it out with just the usual self pleasuring sorts of charms what this means for us is that they are going to have to practice tantric magic for two whole months why dont they just call sting and call it a day

296545 keynote roundtable why does search get the credit for everything
296546 war of the search worlds unifying your global search marketing program
296547 of course you can also see plenty of search engine experts from sem and seo companies speaking at ses san jose and you can also hear lots of representatives of the top search engines speaking at search engine strategies san jose 2008 the fact that ses san jose is being held in the backyard of google and yahoo explains why the top search engines are sending so many people from their engineering and search quality teams to the conference
296548 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
296549 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
296550 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
296551 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
296552 once im healthy im sure ill look at this as a blessing in disguise
296553 right now its a bit painful of course but every athlete goes through these patches and im just grateful that this isnt as bad as it could have been

296556 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
296557 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
296558 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
296559 if the cap is not a real hard cap but is an intensity cap so that it depends on growth rates of different sectors then you have to speculate on it
296560 we thought it was on the optimistic side in terms of how much reductions would actually happen
296561 it helps now and then to step back and take the long view the kingdom is not only beyond our effoerts it is even beyond our vision we accomplish in our lifetime only a tiny fraction of the magnificent enterprise that is the lords work nothing we do is complete which is another way of saying that the kingdom always lies beyond us no statement says all that should be said no prayer fully expresses our faith no confession makes us perfect no pastoral visit brings wholeness no program accomplishes fully the churchs mission no set of goals and objective includes everything this is who we are we plant the seeds that some day will grow we water seeds that were already planted knowing that they hold future promis we lay foundations that will need much further development we provide yeast that produces effects far beyond our capabilities we cannot do everything and realizing that there is a sense of liberation in our very being this enables us to do something and to do it very well it may be incomplete but it is the difference between the master builder and the laborer we are laborers not master builders ministers not the messiah we are prophets of a future that is not our own
296562 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
296563 this makes bostock look like a jilted ex girlfriend trying to save her dignity in the face of a larger more formidable suitor and thats not a good sign for the company
296564 i applaud the decision to reject the offer because i see microsoft as an over the hill corporation destroying green octopus from redmond
296565 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honourable thing and step down from the board
296566 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
296567 his view is that he is making better companies more efficient companies my view is that i look at his background and see he drives a stake into the soul of a company
296568 we are in the midst of a massive transformation and revolution
296569 you lack true morality which is the morality of obligation and it already cost this company money and your shareholders money
296570 i have personally been involved in discussing how we can improve human rights with just as many people as you can imagine
296571 there was a quote once that said by 2012 the asia pacific rim market will be worth 800bn and they yahoo want a piece of that
296572 but im just so proud to be associated with it
296573 i think chicago has at its core a balanced approach to life
296574 my friends here are as excited about the new house we bought as they are about the tony and i like that i dont find that anywhere else
296575 there have been a couple of times in the past when i almost played the stage manager
296576 i always knew i wouldnt walk around with a vest and a pipe chuckling i would just talk conversationally
296577 i dont want to abandon my home where im from or work in that environment but do i want to never live anywhere else
296578 the government has created a tax code that tells wealthy people who dont know what to do with their money to donate it to the arts
296579 and then we stage the black rider and lewis amp clark proving that we dont know what to do with it either
296580 we made the case that the focus was on the upgrade of the stage improving our ability to move scenery bring in new lighting new sound and then audience amenities its a platform for the next 40 years
296581 in short these proposals still hold hyphenates to a higher standard while preserving the special privileges that recognize the unique efforts of the first writer
296582 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
296583 in search of winning a that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
296584 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
296585 having a manager who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
296586 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
296587 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
296588 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title

296600 new houses are now universally horrible and ecohouses are the most horrible of the lot
296601 the chancellor is looking at all of these options sensibly and fairly as he always does and he will come forward in due course with his proposals
296602 weve got to encourage very significant investment in our power generation system over the next 10 to 15 years
296603 we have got to have a fiscal regulatory climate that encourages all of that investment because quite simply it will go elsewhere if there is not confidence in the uk market
296604 the great destruction made of fish by a net or engine called the trawle
296605 gloucester has become like penzance or cape cod a fishing town where fishermen can no longer afford to live
296606 the lobster boom may be a tiny blip on the slippery slope to oceans filled with jellyfish bacteria and slime
296607 it will take a few days for the dust to settle
296608 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of nuclear power stations
296609 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
296610 a push for more nuclear power would scupper the uk renewable energy industry and by doing so cancel out the prospect of creating hundreds of thousands of british green collar jobs
296611 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
296612 knit 2 pull the first stitch over the second stitch
296613 the next doom game will look like its built on another engine as it uses three times the horsepower
296614 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
296615 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
296616 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
296617 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
296618 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
296619 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
296620 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
296621 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
296622 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
296623 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
296624 this bus is an assault vehicle in the fight against global warming be a green patriot
296625 that is far from comforting even once you get your laptop back days or weeks later because nothing in this policy limits the authority of an officer to make written notes about what was in the laptop
296626 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
296627 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
296628 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
296629 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
296630 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
296631 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
296632 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
296633 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
296634 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
296635 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
296636 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
296637 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
296638 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
296639 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
296640 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
296641 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
296642 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
296643 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
296644 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
296645 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
296646 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
296647 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
296648 ive got weekly customers coming in for a kiss it just brightens every bodys day when they go by
296649 we give you a free kiss then we see if youre interested in a storage unit
296650 no no no no they wanted em but they didnt get em
296651 i was paid by the energy companies to be a denialist
296652 i was driven by an ideological belief in favor of neoconservative capitalism against socialism
296653 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
296654 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
296655 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
296656 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
296657 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
296658 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
296659 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
296660 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
296661 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
296662 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
296663 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
296664 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
296665 theyve increased credit loss expectations for the past three quarters and this next one is probably going to be the fourth
296666 turbulent market conditions lie ahead would probably be an understatement
296667 its a big change for me because i spent four years in chicago but im ready to come here and to do well with this team and make a life in this city im very happy to be here and youre going to get 100 per cent out of me every game
296668 im a forward and i get paid to score goals the fans are expecting a lot out of me and i welcome that pressure good players thrive on pressure
296669 i think im a good finisher i get behind the defence and hopefully i can bring a bit of experience to the forward line
296670 they started off great at home this year and have slipped recently but im sure the team will get back on track
296671 they get them and say i will give you 40 or 50 dollars so a lot of people are unemployed and will jump for that
296672 we are not going to allow these people to continue to steal elections with impunity it cannot be tolerated
296673 they dont have one person to say they got paid by albert turner
296674 my work is what got me elected i take care of my people i fight for my people thats what got me elected not money
296675 not understanding the history of what happened in the 50s and 60s
296676 how easy is it to steal an election using absentee ballots very easy very easy
296677 the absentee ballot box is the most vulnerable to voter fraud without changing the loopholes our laws allow of this
296678 you go after black people you go after black democrats you prosecute them for vote fraud boom
296679 the ability of a great number of alabamans to participate at all was bought with the blood of the leaders of the civil rights movement in this very state where votes are being bought and sold
296680 and we will not allow their memories to be desecrated by anybody

296690 id be hurt if this were coming from john lennon so it takes about one minute and 45 seconds to put on eyeliner i suppose during that same time you were writing the next imagine
296691 we have not sold out and continuously for 20 years every arena because we care about just our appearance the music comes first
296692 def leppard shouldnt be knocking anyone about their music since they just did a show called dancing with the stars in the u s and they got crucified because they fucking lip synched the entire show so before they bust anyones balls ive never lip synched a fucking thing in my life ever its the pot calling the kettle black
296693 i was simply making the following simple point when i said a lot of those hollywood bands werent real or whatever i said i was born joseph elliott sav was born richard savage rick was born richard allen phil was born philip collen viv was born vivian campbell and oh steve was born stephen clark i dont think anyone in poison uses their real name do they and i could name hundreds of others who dont but poison came to mind because i was asked about them its nothing personal it was just an answer to a question hey rikki implies were miming on tour ha well hes welcome to come see us anytime he wants obviously not used to hearing a good band very often then is he
296694 i cant believe it i cant believe it finally some justice
296695 the basis under which you granted the bond was absolute misinformation
296696 theres no question that the information given to me in the bond hearing was incorrect
296697 given the severity of the sentencing im revoking this bond
296698 this guy had all the incentive to take off knowing what he would face in prison so to know that there was nothing holding him here that his family wouldnt suffer one bit if he skipped town thats an enormous screwup
296699 to have no oversight on a bond is hard to imagine
296700 what would stop someone from broward county from walking in and saying i have 1 million worth of property so just believe me you have to wonder what kind of checking system the courts in broward county have
296701 this guy was tried and found guilty of what he did
296702 he is the worst of society my son must move on with his life and im glad that judge gold is finally helping us do this
296703 if you take no other training this year do the democracy school it is a superlative unfolding revelation of how corporations have hijacked democracy it meticulously deconstructs the historical arc that brought us to this precipice but most important it goes into the highly pragmatic and inspiring work now under way that is slowly turning the tide this second american revolution may be the most important political work going on anywhere in the country or the world
296704 democracy school was a mind blowing experience during the school i was forced to come to grips with the understanding that i really knew very little about the true structure of law that controls our activism democracy school is a must for everyone who seeks to be liberated from our defensive after the fact reactive organizing strategies

296725 chinas reluctance to delve into domestic affairs has raised concern internationally but the trade without conditions approach has been hailed by many african leaders who are tired of being dictated to by their western peers
296726 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
296727 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
296728 beijing organisers will honour the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
296729 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
296730 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed
296731 its possible to block individual locations but would be very complicated

296738 the detroit automakers have had their heads in the sand for a long time but they seem to have pulled them out now and are reacting and reacting quickly
296739 firstly robbie coming in and the new coaching staff there was a time of getting to understand each other
296740 now we know exactly what we are trying to achieve we have been improving
296741 the mindset is to bring everything you can to the performance and thats what everyone has been doing whether they have been playing for 50 test matches or their first few test matches

296743 and whats been really good about this group is we are pretty tight weve been spending a lot of time with each other

296747 but if the history between librarything and shelfari is any indication were more likely to see amazon either place its bets on one and divest its shares in the other or simply maintain a minority investment in both
296748 at no point did the board or management in any way despite rumors and speculation ever resist microsofts proposal there was never any doubt that the board was open to a deal with microsoft and for search only if it made sense but ultimately there was never a compelling offer put on the table
296749 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
296750 any figure that looks interesting or different is usually wrong
296751 when you discover something interesting assume that its wrong and dig deeper for a reason why
296752 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
296753 we are really delighted to finally have justice and we would like to thank everyone who has supported us today we are elated

296755 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
296756 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
296757 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
296758 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
296759 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
296760 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
296761 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
296762 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
296763 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
296764 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak
296765 they dont believe in it any more people will vote for bibi because they say if there is no peace we might as well have a strong leader
296766 the television station was owned and run by the milosevic family and was deliberately targeted by nato using a cruise missile because it was seen as the main purveyor of serbian state propaganda jill dando by this stage had become one of the if not the face s of the bbc
296767 the murder certainly hadnt been planned and carried out in just three days

296773 the clergy are like manure excellent when spread all over the country while doing their work but when gathered together in a heap they stink
296774 so called child abuse scandal all child abuse is scandalous but it is the unjustified and remorseless denigration of jersey and her people that is the real scandal
296775 our reputation has been shredded we have almost been presented as being an island of paedophiles
296776 images remain with me the tree from which one care leaver saw his friend hanging michael collins a 14 year old boy hung himself at the home in the 1960s the small windows behind which they were detained for lengthy periods in solitary confinement the fields of corn which they ran across barely clothed in their escape attempts the playing field they were never allowed to go on
296777 in the year up to march 2007 160 children went missing from care institutions in the uk
296778 its not happened in 800 years so why should it happen now
296779 although it was wrong of some people to dig up his dead body and stab it in the street i can well understand their feelings he was never popular requiescat in pace and the next letter
296780 there isnt much of her but what there is is choice

296787 by wednesday this week i couldnt stand to see my face or hear my voice
296788 i know that seeing so much of my work can be a very emotional experience
296789 but the emotions not all bad im not a victim to everything i want people to feel the highs and lows the bed was fantastic and seminal the tent was seminal but there are other kinds of work and there is a lot of hard work involved in this art the blankets for instance are all really hard work and they are not all about me this show is a chance for people to see another side of me and my work
296790 come unto me every time i feel love i think christ im going to be crucified so i close my eyes and i become the cross so beautifull sic
296791 when im having sex and being fucked and i disappear into the ether and its amazing i feel like i am being crucified and it makes me feel of jesus and how he is supposed to represent love when you really feel love for someone you go to another place and that level of ecstasy could be heaven theres nothing blasphemous about it its absolutely genuine making love and being in love are just fantastic it should happen more often
296792 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
296793 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
296794 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
296795 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
296796 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
296797 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
296798 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
296799 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
296800 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
296801 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
296802 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
296803 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
296804 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
296805 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
296806 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
296807 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
296808 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
296809 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
296810 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
296811 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
296812 the spouse has traditionally carried a major burden and has contributed to the success of the other halfs job
296813 i suspect being the spouse will in some way be every bit as a challenging as being high commissioner
296814 one trial of being a diplomats wife is having to make polite conversation at these terrible dinner parties i remember in syria i found myself at a table with the indian ambassador and some other people who didnt speak very good english there was a deathly silence that i thought i should fill so i started talking about markets in different countries i was gabbling away about potatoes when i suddenly noticed that the indian ambassador had fallen asleep
296815 once i started to tell the story of the pied piper of hamlin and all the people on my table thought that it was something that had happened last week and that this terrible paedophile had made off with all these children
296816 so often in foreign office marriages there is perhaps one less happy partner and one very happy partner with the less happy partner enduring living somewhere where they dont really want to live for their partners sake because they know that its exactly what he or she wants to do
296817 you have to have a very good marriage to be a diplomats wife because it can be very lonely
296818 the difficulty is that the sort of life that we lead where you are always moving around makes it very difficult for anyone to have a career as say an accountant or a lawyer we have managed to get the best of both worlds which is great
296819 we were thinking about what we would do next we would both have horrid days in our respective environments and tom said well what about doing something where we can share
296820 from that grew the idea that we could apply for our next job together because we were both at the same level we thought we could do it as a job share
296821 i think the reason our job share got so much support from the foreign office was that it ticked so many boxes
296822 i think there was a certain amount of anxiety among staff at the embassy when they heard we were going to be coming up over the horizon but very quickly feedback became very positive particularly on the management side
296823 i dont know if you work harder but if you are only working for four months you have targets for what you want to achieve within those four months and our previous boss used to say that she got an injection of energy every four months
296824 certainly other diplomats that weve met yes they have been envious particularly when they have been forced to have one of them posted to one country and another to a neighbouring country and ended up having to split the family up
296825 if one of our children wakes up in the night because of a scary dream or a nose bleed they will generally get into our bed on the side of whichever of us is on home duty
296826 the only thing i have noticed is that i get asked a lot what on earth i do for the four months when i am not at work
296827 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
296828 others from president clintons team are in a hurry to see me dead
296829 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena
296830 holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
296831 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
296832 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
296833 mr holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
296834 excessive absenteeism and a lack of engagement could be a problem particularly as the olympics will be going on during office hours
296835 we estimate that the olympics could cost britain up to 600 000 in lost productivity
296836 people spend more during big sporting events the world cup added around 1bn to the economy
296837 we are going to see much more digital consumption of these olympics with people using pdas and mobiles to get their olympic updates
296838 the way we consume news has changed and what we are likely to see is employees getting a quick sporting fix in bite sized chunks and then getting on with their work
296839 we want people to connect with what is happening on the other side of the world if we lose employees attention for the 10 seconds of the 100m i dont think we have to be too worried
296840 organisations need to be aware that this type of event generates a huge amount of interest and they need to be flexible but firm
296841 there is no need to be a spoilsport but staff may need to be reminded that they still have contractual requirements and if they are switching off it may be their colleagues who have to shoulder the burden
296842 the chinese community is extremely excited about the olympics there has been a lot of bad press but this really is the first chance for our mother country to show the world what it can do
296843 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
296844 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
296845 there is no arrangement on this and those stories are not accurate
296846 thatcher should only be allowed a state funeral if the contract is put out to compulsory competitive tender and awarded to the lowest bidder any offers
296847 for all the speculation about whether humphrey the cat the former no 10 cat is going to be the next leadership contender and that was taking up acres of pages the no 10 agenda was on the economy
296848 the really big striking contrast between working at no 10 and government departments is the extent to which the economy dominates whether it is gas prices mortgage starts the insolvencies the edf takeover of british energy all the economic news that is about peoples standard of living and prospects for the future
296849 we have to make sure that everything is put in place as much as possible to make sure they are fully protected
296850 it was also very timely for me to be there at the 10th anniversary of the national minimum wages since i invented the low pay commission when i was in opposition as a shadow employment secretary
296851 he was not at all ringing up saying dont do this or do that but gordon and i have worked together for 25 years so we kind of understand each other
296852 fantastic news this trial has gone on for an extremely long time and it has built up the pressure on them they are very very happy indeed to have been found innocent
296853 we extend our sympathies to those affected by this incident the conclusion of this civilian case means that the army can now consider whether any internal administrative action should follow
296854 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
296855 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
296856 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
296857 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
296858 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
296859 we met with beijing organisers and the chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues
296860 beijing organisers will honour the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
296861 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
296862 its good news that our site has been unblocked in olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but it is still a long way from the complete media freedom promised it seems public outrage has succeeded where the iocs quiet diplomacy had failed
296863 its possible to block individual locations but would be very complicated
296864 it could have come from the suits or trousers in miss dandos wardrobe or from her fiance alan farthings wardrobe
296865 it could have been contaminated by people walking past on the path
296866 i would not be confident in putting any weight on the fibre
296867 barry george an innocent man has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer we wish the police the best of luck in finding the real perpetrator
296868 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends
296869 however we respect the decision of the court the investigation was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
296870 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
296871 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
296872 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
296873 it was a little bumpy but nothing out of the ordinary
296874 it was a cruise holiday you take whatever mother nature dishes out
296875 the investigations revealed various characteristics which are often contained in claims of this type fictitious children who are often twins or disabled and apparently the claimant is self employed
296876 you know that custody is inevitable for the crime you have committed this was a wholesale assault on the benefit system
296877 there seems to be this code of silence or lack of trust in the police
296878 the first 48 hours of any homicide investigation are critical weve passed that now were in for the long haul
296879 we had one decapitation some time ago but nothing like this
296880 i dont even know how many times i stabbed her
296881 it was more than once i only stopped when she was dead
296882 i had to get rid of the body quickly the only way out was to cut her up wasnt it it was just like cutting a piece of meat
296883 we dont have any information yet about what exactly she was doing here in brazil
296884 but she knew lots of brazilians from london and she always said that she would like to live in brazil because of the weather london is much colder than it is here and she was curious
296885 he is a drug user and he was always under the effect of drugs and he became very aggressive
296886 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
296887 i dragged her body into the bathroom then i put the body to one side and i got into the shower and washed then i locked the apartment and went out to the party
296888 she doesnt seem like the kind of girl who would have died without a fight
296889 she was a cool girl with a good heart and like all adolescents she had her crazy side
296890 we have asked the police liaison officer to contact the brazilian embassy and get things speeded up
296891 wonderful things for the confidence of black people around the world
296892 these types of systems provide the ability to contact a member of public or staff without risking direct confrontation
296893 clinging to its hill like a tipsy man to a lamp post
296894 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident waiting to happen
296895 this is a basic service it is unbelievable that we are just being cut off
296896 i dont see how i can continue to work from home what business is going to come and set up here if they cant be sure theyll get their post
296897 this is the thin end of the wedge for remote communities everywhere and it must be stopped it raises real concerns for all our rural services
296898 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
296899 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
296900 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
296901 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
296902 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
296903 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration it is very rare the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
296904 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
296905 i have become more political after the article in the guardian last year when he first dissociated himself from the games i have become the only person who can speak out if i dont there will be total silence
296906 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
296907 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
296908 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
296909 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
296910 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
296911 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
296912 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society
296913 some things are hard to return to the way they were take the internet and the flow of information when you open the window and see blue sky and feel fresh air nobody wants to close it again
296914 it was in fact no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by george than that it had come from some other source
296915 if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial there is no certainty that they would have found barry george guilty for this reason his conviction had to be quashed
296916 he described to me that he can be aware of whats going on around him but he just cant respond
296917 i am sure mr george has inherited a gene or genes which pre dispose him to epilepsy or cognitive impairment
296918 measures of his ability to plan and organise himself and to carry out or execute various things
296919 its not good for us the fact the jury took 13 hours to acquit means they were utterly convinced he was not guilty
296920 the fact he has previous bad character will help protect the organistaion and weather the storm
296921 are they really going to say to hamish campbell were going to disembowel your investigation and see where it went wrong it probably needs an external force to reinvestigate
296922 it is just a matter of time before i am killed
296923 i dont like to let the warders out of my sight i feel there is a contract out on my head and one of the prisoners is just waiting for the right time to strike a few come up to me in the dinner queue and say watch your back mate they are after you lots of the prisoners liked jill and blamed me for murdering her
296924 lots have come up to me and said we know you didnt do it murder jill
296925 we dont know why he has placed himself on the list
296926 i would be very surprised if theres not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering he has had to endure
296927 the secretary of state decides whether compensation is payable at present there is no limit to the amount of compensation the assessor can award but when section 61 of the criminal justice act 2008 is commenced the limits will be 500 000 for less than 10 years in jail previous convictions are not taken into account when deciding eligibility but once eligibility has been confirmed the independent assessor may make a reduction in the compensation award
296928 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
296929 theres no point in feeling nostalgic its only paper and its still money
296930 its been particularly successful among older people who still have francs hidden away in drawers and cupboards and old wallets
296931 one man i know was going through the pockets of an old suit when he found 400f now hes going to come and spend it all
296932 its a difficult time people are looking more and more at the prices before they buy
296933 one lady found seven 200 franc notes in a suitcase a man came in after finding some old notes stuffed away in a briefcase another customer a widow had found some francs while going through her husbands wallet
296934 weve even had a call from one woman in the marne saying she had 20 000f shes going to come up this weekend and spend it
296935 stand for france while the euro stands well for europe
296936 even people of my generation do the sums in francs if theyre thinking of buying a house or a car
296937 you no longer have to show tourists where the cash machine is and they no longer have to do the conversion
296938 the french are very patriotic and the franc was always part of that
296939 but the euro is much more practical i dont think anyone would want the franc back for good
296940 when we first dreamed up the idea of building tornado in 1990
296941 we entertained the notion that a whole generation of locospotters about a third of boys in any school class in the 60s and a few of their sisters were grown up and many with decent jobs all the a1s had been scrapped so we reckoned we could tempt mature enthusiasts into shelling out for one
296942 is that the project has involved people from all walks of life old and new technologies and its nurtured tremendous affection bordering on love
296943 im still not entirely clear on what we can and cannot say about season three so i will just say that we have not yet begun work on season four as for what might happen if there were to be say a theoretical season three well lets just say that many questions from seasons one and two would have to be answered now wouldnt they
296944 a lot of ideas for this show start out with
296945 what have been some things that you have found to be hard to cut out of a given story transformers or otherwise were there any concepts in a show youre worked on that youd have liked to explore further how is it decided what stays and what is cut
296946 there are a couple of funny trick or treat bits we had to cut from
296947 after a short period of conversation in english it became clear to me that the dvd was showing porn it was playing at the loudest possible volume thereafter for the next month the porn movies were played all night
296948 it was very humiliating for me to be treated in this way by the british army if they expected me to give in to my basic instincts they did not realise that i am not that kind of man i was determined not be sexually aroused by this but it made me physically sick
296949 i was spun about for between 15 30 minutes to disorientate me
296950 the use of sensory bombardment and in particular the pornographic films to attempt to break down this male muslim shows that the uk were doing exactly the same as the us using coercive interrogation techniques developed in the 1960s and especially in northern ireland and then refined to fit the so called war on terror
296951 mr al fartoosi who was a senior commander in the jaish al mahdi militia in basra was interned for the protection of uk forces and iraqi nationals we are not aware of any allegations of abuse being made by him during his internment claims are now being investigated by the special investigation branch of the royal military police
296952 eight dont asks displayed on posters in a central beijing district that give conversational etiquette guidelines to residents for when they meet foreigners or disabled athletes during next months olympics
296953 etiquette when communicating with foreigners locals are instructed not to ask foreigners personal questions about their age salary love life health income political views religious beliefs or personal experiences
296954 its normal for chinese to ask people they just met such questions but foreigners respond negatively to such questions beijing municipal government spokeswoman wang zhaoqian said wednesday
296955 by educating locals we hope that they will become more socially sensitive when communicating with visitors she said
296956 there has never been a more critical time to invest
296957 we are a brand driven industry if you look back at the history of the american beer industry when the brands are properly supported the business grows
296958 some of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
296959 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates
296960 he talks about honor and democracy but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot free why not let the people decide
296961 i understand that president musharraf of pakistan has his own challenges but let me make this clear there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3 000 americans they are plotting to strike again it was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al qaeda leadership meeting in 2005 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
296962 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
296963 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
296964 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges he said
296965 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
296966 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum he said

296977 and whats been really good about this group is we are pretty tight weve been spending a lot of time with each other

296980 we were trying to get him back by round 18 we think hes still on line to get back by round 19 its dropped back just a week
296981 he had some soreness so we went and got some more mris theyve come up fine so we thought we might even put a needle in and have a look at it to see if we were missing anything and we werent
296982 because he hasnt been active hes got some built up scar tissue there and soreness around it

296989 however with internet access just around the corner on u s flights it wont be long before the ban on voice communications on in flight planes is lifted our bill the hang up act would ensure that financially strapped airlines dont drive us towards this noisome disruption in search of further revenue
296990 cell phone users should not be able to disrupt the comfort of an entire airplane cabin especially when other passengers have no choice but to sit there and listen

297124 the network operators can recoup their investment in the network and can charge for access to network services but consumers have complete control over the devices and content that dont have anything to do with investment in the underlying network
297125 the commission is very careful in that we look at the particular facts that are in front of us we are not judging the next case

297156 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
297157 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
297158 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
297159 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
297160 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
297161 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
297162 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
297163 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

297207 when a franchisor files for bankruptcy the franchisees are in a very vulnerable place but not in a hopeless place
297208 if they do nothing they are at the second lowest rung on the pecking order for the distribution of assets they can have their supply chain go away their ownership goes away and there is an immediate devaluation of their brand
297209 if they mobilize their common resources in an association and bring about common counsel they probably have the wherewithal to acquire the brand and improve their ownership rights vis vis whatever their franchise agreement might have been
297210 sometimes franchisees cannot see the big picture and can only see their location on main street
297211 whether franchise owners want to run their chain or not is one thing but they certainly have a say in who runs it
297212 our present supply chain will last between 30 to 60 days
297213 we will work diligently with the new owners to make sure that theres a supply chain the second thing is to let our guests know that our restaurants are still here

297287 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
297288 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
297289 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems

297352 eu voi incheia anul viitor activitatea competitionala si nu mi fac probleme ca nu vor fi alti jucatori care sa ma inlocuiasca hanescu traverseaza acum o forma buna apoi mai sint tineri care vin puternic din urma cum ar fi ungur cruciat crivoi mergea ori tecau la fete trecem apoi printr o perioada buna pentru ca avem doua reprezentante aproape de top 50 si cred ca romania va cunoaste o ascensiune in momentul in care vom face una sau doua academii de tenis

297389 pare incredibil insa nu cred ca voi putea completa foaia de joc cu 18 jucatori intr un meci din etapa a doua dintre accidentati buta onut si ignatov lipsesc suta la suta iar branet 99 in plus tanasa e suspendat iar lui lamine nu i a ajuns cartea verde
297390 sint ingrijorat pentru ca apelurile pe care le am facut inaintea sezonului cu privire la arbitraj au fost in zadar din prima etapa am fost dezavantajati la 0 0 cu craiova neprimind un penalty pe care l a vazut o tara intreaga nu sint vreun smecher sa spun ca puteam bate cu 3 0 daca primeam acel 11 metri si nu vreau sa diminuez meritele universitatii insa pot sa afirm ca jocul curgea altfel daca berbecaru lua masura ce se impunea in plus acest arbitru nici macar nu a vrut sa stea de vorba cu presedintele nostru la pauza pe teren sa nu spun sa si ceara scuze la final berbecaru ar trebui sa ne plateasca drumul cazarea si primele pentru meciul de la craiova sint curios ce masuri se vor lua impotriva lui am tot tacut insa nu vrem sa fim luati de fraieri eu nu vreau decit sa fim arbitrati corect poate ca e prea mult in jungla care este acum romania
297391 chiar daca avem atitea probleme chiar daca e deranj mare pentru ca jucam fara al 12 lea jucator publicul chiar daca vasluiul e o echipa puternica putem obtine un rezultat pozitiv printr o mobilizare exemplara
297392 a spus antrenorul viorel hizo care a apreciat ca lipsa spectatorilor poate constitui un avantaj pentru echipa sa
297393 il felicit pe domnul porumboiu pentru ce a facut la vaslui la ce jucatori are vasluiul si ce conditii e normal sa se bata chiar la titlu imi pare rau ca nu exista si la iasi un porumboiu
297394 da de ce nu se transmite steaua pe antena sau de ce nu se da dinamo deloc
297395 leul a fluctuat in aceasta sedinta intr un interval restrins intre 3 51 si 3 52 lei euro este posibil sa testeze totusi spre finalul zilei nivelul de 3 50 lei euro in functie de datele despre economia americana care vor fi publicate in aceasta dupa amiaza
297396 daca ati venit pentru licitatie trebuie sa fiti instiintat ca exista un antecontract de vinzare cumparare incheiat pentru bunurile scoase la licitatie daca veti cumpara veti fi considerat de rea credinta si ne vom opune actului incheiat
297397 daca nu faceati prostia sa cereti anularea actului poate acum nu eram aici in schimb v ati trezit cu o decizie definitiva si irevocabila pe care mai devreme sau mai tirziu va trebui sa o respectati
297398 sintem la o licitatie nu la un proces nu faceti parte din comitetul credal deci nu indepliniti nici o functie care sa va permita inscrierea la aceasta licitatie iar rubricile procesului verbal sint foarte stricte daca doriti sa faceti dovada prezentei dumneavostra aici atunci folositi opozitia de vinzare semnata
297399 fiind vorba de a treia licitatie si pentru ca nu s a primit cel putin pretul de incepere a licitatiei conform codului de procedura civila bunul se scoate din nou la vinzare la cel mai bun pret oferit
297400 este un pret corect pentru aceasta suprafata si daca tinem cont de preturile de pe piata imobiliara vom construi acolo mai multe cladiri de birouri cu functii complexe spatii de recreere si locuinte
297401 nu ne este frica de nici un proces noi am studiat niste acte in care se preciza clar vinzare libera de sarcini noi nu ne facem griji pentru ca in caz de ceva lichidatorul isi va asuma riscul daca e corecta sau nu aceasta exprimarea
297402 aceasta suma nici macar nu acopera datoriile pe care societatea le are la finante pretul este foarte mic dar noi nu avem cum sa facem contestatie sintem 320 de angajati care trebuie sa primim 1 1 milioane de lei dar in conditiile de fata nu cred ca ne vom putea recupera banii eu astept aceasta licitatie de aproape trei ani si sint epuizat zilnic ma suna oamenii sa ma intrebe de salariile lor speranta noastra este ca mai sint ceva active care trebuie scoase la vinzare si atunci poate ne recuperam si noi banii
297403 sint obligat prin dispozitiile de procedura civila sa adjudec bunurile care prin procedura de insolventa se vind liber de sarcina daca creditorii vor considera pretul prea mic atunci vor putea ataca actul de adjudecare
297404 codul de procedura civila nu te obliga sa vinzi ci iti da posibilitatea sa faci acest lucru la cea de a treia licitatie daca pretul este mic poti refuza si sa organizezi o alta licitatie dar daca nu este unul derizoriu atunci poti sa vinzi
297405 noi ne am facut datoria si am anuntat cumparatorul de situatie asteptam sa vedem daca achita suma si atunci ii vom intenta proces sa ne inapoieze activele este ciudata situatia ca desi stia de opozitia noastra nu a avut nici un interes pentru a vedea actele si nici o intrebare
297406 la filele 50 si 51 din dosar sint depuse adresele emise de catre anaf catre societatea debitoare in care se specifica ca este de acord sa intocmeasca si sa comunice raportul de evaluare al bunului
297407 se mentioneaza ca prezentul antecontract se intocmeste pentru achitarea obligatiilor catre buget in baza art 155 cod procedura fiscala cu respectarea informatiilor si solicitarilor formulate de catre anaf dgfpj iasi exprimat prin adresa nr 53 125 14 iunie 2006
297408 la data de 16 noiembrie 2007 dgfp iasi a formulat concluzii scrise cu privirea la litigiul mentionat procesul intentat de sigma mentionindu se faptul ca antecontractul de vinzare cumparare a fost facut fara acordul organului fiscal

297419 the ministry really has to realize that the scooter style is working the open frame is not
297420 whats preventing these from proliferating is that the marketing is hesitant because at the end of the day who knows how the pilot project will end up
297421 these are police who at 300 paces can tell the difference between a camaro and a mustang
297422 why cant they tell the difference between a scooter and an electric bike its just one of interest and communication
297423 the declining rate in production is between 8 and 10 per year that means production will finish in 10 years time if we have not found new reserves
297424 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
297425 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
297426 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
297427 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
297428 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
297429 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
297430 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
297431 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
297432 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
297433 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
297434 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
297435 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
297436 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
297437 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
297438 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
297439 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
297440 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
297441 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
297442 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
297443 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
297444 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
297445 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
297446 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
297447 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
297448 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
297449 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
297450 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
297451 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
297452 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
297453 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
297454 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
297455 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
297456 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
297457 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
297458 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
297459 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
297460 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
297461 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
297462 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
297463 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
297464 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
297465 is in a phase which it hasnt been in the last four years
297466 im starting to believe that i can beat the best players in the world im not giving them as much respect

297468 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
297469 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
297470 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
297471 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
297472 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
297473 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
297474 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
297475 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
297476 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
297477 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
297478 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
297479 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
297480 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
297481 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
297482 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
297483 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
297484 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
297485 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
297486 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
297487 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
297488 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
297489 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
297490 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
297491 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
297492 its really exciting to see whats going to come next and how merediths going to deal with living with a boy and all the things a man like derek who has been married and is a grown up might expect
297493 they are definitely on a journey and its going to be a really interesting one also both actresses are so game theyre so willing to do something
297494 she says to me that i dont know where he is he had to leave town it was an emergency
297495 well work to the best of our ability to put forward attractive commercial terms to be able to attract all potential customers to our project
297496 we will be doing everything we can to attract all potential customers be they the existing leaseholders on the north slope or other parties that may wish to be a shipper on our pipeline
297497 transcanada is confident that gas prices are high enough that the project is economic and we believe that all stakeholders are highly motivated to advance the project to success
297498 weve been trying to get this pipeline for 30 years
297499 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
297500 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
297501 its a shame that peoples awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles
297502 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
297503 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
297504 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
297505 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
297506 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
297507 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
297508 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
297509 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
297510 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
297511 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak
297512 they dont believe in it any more people will vote for bibi because they say if there is no peace we might as well have a strong leader

297516 this is a showroom for comedy not a toxic club

297519 the best of the varsity team starts at 8 p m
297520 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
297521 victorious warriors win first and then go to war while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win
297522 i know lets make a 450 pound something and try and make it fly maybe we can launch it over a river just to be safe hand me that napkin ill sketch it out should we order another round
297523 i have broken deals with civ x in the past
297524 the columbia broadcasting system and its affiliated stations present orson welles and the mercury theatre on the air in the war of the worlds by h g wells
297525 today 8 00 9 00 play h g wellss war of the worlds wabc
297526 in behalf of the mercury theater of the air it is deeply regretful to learn that the h
297527 followed the original closely but to make the imaginary details more interesting to american listeners the adapter orson welles substituted an american locale for the english scenes of the story
297528 nevertheless the program apparently was produced with such vividness that some listeners who may have heard only fragments thought the broadcast was fact not fiction
297529 naturally it was neither columbias nor the mercury theatres intention to mislead any one and when it became evident that a part of the audience had been disturbed by the performance five announcements were read over the network later in the evening to reassure those listeners
297530 i dont think we will choose anything like this again
297531 people might be bored or annoyed at hearing a tale so improbable
297532 queries to newspapers from radio listeners throughout the u s tonight regarding a reported meteor fall which killed a number of new jerseyites are the result of a studio dramatization
297533 station wabc informs us that the broadcast just concluded over that station was a dramatization of a play no cause for alarm
297534 note to all receivers wabc broadcast as drama re this section being attacked by residents of mars imaginary affair
297535 what time will it be the end of the world
297536 ive heard a lot of radio programs but ive never heard anything as rotten as that it was too realistic for comfort they broke into a dance program with a news flash it went on just like press radio news
297537 the world is coming to an end and i have a lot to do
297538 i came home at 9 15 p m just in time to receive a call from my nephew who was frantic with fear he told me the city was about to be bombed from the air and advised me to get out of the building at once i turned on the radio and heard the broadcast which corroborated what my nephew had said grabbed a few personal belongings and ran to the elevator when i got to the street there were hundreds of people milling around in panic most of us ran toward broadway and it was not until we stopped taxi drivers who had heard the entire broadcast on their radios that we knew what it was all about it was the most asinine stunt i ever heard of
297539 i heard that broadcast and almost had a heart attack
297540 i didnt tune it in until the program was half over but when i heard the names and titles of federal state and municipal officials and when the secretary of the interior was introduced i was convinced it was the mccoy i ran out into the street with scores of others and found people running in all directions the whole thing came over as a news broadcast and in my mind it was a pretty crummy thing to do
297541 then i went to the roof and i could see the smoke from the bombs drifting over toward new york what shall i do
297542 where can i volunteer my services weve got to stop this awful thing
297543 my god where can i volunteer my services weve got to stop this awful thing
297544 i shall request prompt consideration of this matter by the commission
297545 i withhold final judgment until later but any broadcast that creates such general panic and fear as this one is reported to have done is to say the least regrettable
297546 the widespread public reaction to this broadcast as indicated by the press is another demonstration of the power and force of radio and points out again the serious public responsibility of those who are licensed to operate the station
297547 the commission should proceed with great caution so as not to take any action which would impede radios being used for development of the dramatic arts
297548 censoring what shall or shall not be said of the radio
297549 i do not believe isolated instances of poor service necessarily constitute grounds for the revocation of the license of a station this does not apply to criminal offenses
297550 the cbs and welles have far overstepped their rights in the matter and should make a full retraction
297551 censoring what shall or shall not be said over the radio the public does not want a spineless radio
297552 people who have material broadcast into their homes without warnings have a right to protection too many broadcasters have insisted that they could broadcast anything they liked contending that they were protected by the prohibition of censorship certainly when people are injured morally physically spiritually and psychically they have just as much right to complain as if the laws against obscenity and indecency were violated
297553 in order that this may not happen again the program department hereafter will not use the technique of a stimulated news broadcast within a dramatization when the circumstances of the broadcast could cause immediate alarm to numbers of listeners
297554 this instance emphasizes the responsibility we assume in the use of radio and renews our determination to fulfill to the highest degree our obligation to the public i know that cbs and those of us in radio have only the most profound regret that the composure of many of our fellow citizens was disturbed by the vivid broadcast cbs system has taken immediate steps to insure that such program technique will not be used again
297555 the widespread public reaction to this broadcast as indicated by the press is another demonstration of the power and force of radio and points out again the serious responsibility of those who are licensed to operate stations
297556 so what are you gonna do about it home slice

297578 you could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this the s amp p 500 was down around 1 200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1 250 or so i think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market
297579 overall the us banks reported weak but not disastrous second quarter results and the markets breathed a sigh of relief

297620 i dont know that she has signed a formal contract yet and i dont know of anything thats in the way
297621 but we have a lot of children who eat everything on their plate they eat it all because they are hungry
297622 were one of the highest in free and reduced meals in the school system at about 83 percent that shows a large percentage of our families are low socio economic
297623 in todays economy with gas prices and food prices going up i think were going to unfortunately see more children needing help
297624 we do an evaluation with the program the biggest thing we notice is the attitudes of the kids they tend to treat one another better and get along better the program seems to help the parents financially and the children enjoy the food
297625 i dont know why i didnt challenge it before to me it is sacred
297626 when you see picture of flag draped coffin in newspapers i cannot imagine any american that does not look at that and grieve when that coffin is taken off the plane you dont know the name you know it is an american who lost his life for this country it reminds american people through the photograph that we are at war
297627 there will be no arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel returning or departing from ramstein air base or dover air force base
297628 throughout the history of our nation members of the united states armed forces have selflessly given their lives to secure and protect the freedoms americans enjoy today
297629 today our military is serving our nation in iraq afghanistan and many other parts of the world without a loved one serving in the military it is sometimes possible for americans to overlook the sacrifices that have been made and continue to be made by members of the armed forces on behalf of our nation
297630 weve been working with the national and ohio mccain campaign and the republican national committee for a number of days to bring the senator to allen county
297631 its always exciting and its a lot of work for our local volunteers but once again allen county is scoring at the top
297632 im calling on behalf of john mccain who will be in lima next week for a major campaign event he will discuss his plan to keep and create jobs in ohio get our economy moving again and lower gas prices
297633 they need to call 911 immediately and they need to keep an eye on the snake
297634 i used to hunt them out there got interested more in them so i decided to get a couple
297635 a week has passed since the tragic death of michael smith and i wanted to give an update as to where the investigation is at this point
297636 since the night of the incident the detectives of the lpd have worked almost non stop on trying to identify who shot michael smith and locating that person
297637 and they are just not stepping forward it is our responsibility to solve this tragedy and we accept that responsibility but we need the community to help
297638 this type of behavior and thought pattern is not acceptable and has no place in our community
297639 what were asking people to do is to be responsible citizens

297644 the decision to resort to the use of force was a careless blunder to say the least made over cautionary advice of the un secretariat here in new york
297645 upper echelons of the secretariat here in new york to consider the issue of individual responsibility
297646 dialogue was continuing what happened happened out of the blue it was 5 a m 4 a m in the morning they stormed the house mostly occupied by women they started breaking doors and twisting arms

297649 my olympic gold medal means everything to me and that experience alone became the launching pad for my professional boxing career i will never forget how wonderful it felt to represent my country atop the gold medal stand and for that honor i am truly grateful
297650 traveled across america on 13 cents and a bag of paint from nyc to portland for love
297651 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
297652 happiness is a state of mind it all depends on how you look at things
297653 the board concluded that the offer of 33 a share significantly undervalued yahoo
297654 in an offhand comment they said to one of our management people there may be a few more dollars on the table
297655 i cant tell you to this day why they did that
297656 this is not a new discovery as reports on the issue appeared more than 70 years ago
297657 our research results are only reconfirming an old theory and provide a clearer direction for treatment
297658 in treatment nave patients atazanavir ritonavir once daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir ritonavir twice daily with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia the results of this study support the use of once daily atazanavir ritonavir as a recommended first line treatment option with a number of patient benefits over the currently recommended ritonavir boosted twice daily lopinavir for the treatment of hiv infected antiretroviral naive patients
297659 ha sido la m s cordial que recuerda muy fruct fera y con un di logo muy abierto
297660 el gobierno est poniendo todos los medios para hacer frente al frenazo econ mico
297661 di logo muy abierto muy sincero y muy fruct fero
297662 sinceramente creo que no hay en ese sentido ning n problema sino m s bien todo lo contrario
297663 tomando medidas y planificando las decisiones que tiene a su alcance
297664 poder hacer algo directo para que bajara el precio del petr leo que es un factor determinante de nuestra situaci n econ mica pero eso depende de otros factores
297665 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
297666 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
297667 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
297668 found nearly all of the same problems and deficiencies that had been reported one year previously
297669 the reality is that kbrs actions were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents
297670 but once its finished all the students and teachers here are really going to appreciate it
297671 my niece lived here she died of cancer at 32
297672 the people who lived through love canal need to know what their risks are and what they might expect for their children
297673 the state health department is proud of the work we have done on love canal over the years
297674 today for the first time in two years south east queenslanders will actually be able to use the hose but that is just for half an hour and just between 4 and 4 30pm
297675 on saturday thats for odd numbered houses and on sunday even numbered houses
297676 you can use the extra half hour of hosing for watering the garden you cant use it on the lawn you can wash the outside of your house but you cant hose pathways you can hose in the allotted half hour to wash the car but you cant use it on the driveway
297677 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
297678 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
297679 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
297680 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
297681 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
297682 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
297683 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
297684 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
297685 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
297686 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
297687 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important
297688 i talked to him last night china time about a misunderstanding on the report
297689 its better when we have a chance to sit down and talk face to face
297690 before training camp before the season we have a lot of time i think we can be good friends
297691 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
297692 if something i said would make ron feel uncomfortable i apologize
297693 im really sorry about that because i still dont know him very well still by the time we stay together obviously i will fix it
297694 right now the rockets made a good trade for us and we got a good player
297695 i think that can put our team in the next level
297696 i had a wonderful experience playing at colonial in 2003 and when i look back on my career i will always think about that i think it was really a turning point in my career and as a person
297697 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men
297698 all im thinking about is trying to play some good golf how can i limit the number of bogeys i make how can i maximize the number of birdies i can make out of this golf course and thats all i can focus on i cant focus on the rest of the field
297699 people are going to write hateful stuff about me and thats fine with me amp good rounds and low scores can solve everything
297700 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
297701 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
297702 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
297703 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
297704 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
297705 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
297706 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
297707 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
297708 there was nothing in the world that could set him off or make him do anything wrong to anybody
297709 as far as ive known him hed never got into a single fight in his whole life
297710 its early and i think the judge just wants to respect his rights to speak to counsel and hes giving him that opportunity
297711 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that be without a lawyer
297712 he was just such an amazing guy he had a great personality
297713 he never cared for sitting around unless it was for a weekend with the guys playing risk he was always big on travelling he didnt like to sit in one place
297714 i know he was from edmonton i dont know why he was on the bus thats still under investigation
297715 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
297716 broken trying to find my way trying to find the faith thats gone
297717 if i run to you will you hold me in your arms forevermore
297718 tell me slow down if you know that im going too fast for my own good
297719 we all have an unbridled passion that those who have been severely injured valiantly serving our nation be provided every possible tool which will allow them to pursue their dreams
297720 we have just recently awarded 64 segways in april and may and hope to be able to raise the necessary funding to present an additional 135 segways prior to the end of 2008
297721 obviously the present condition of the economy makes this effort ever more challenging but it is one we will pursue vigorously
297722 we of course could not do this without the support of the american people who are giving us the privilege of serving the great men and women of the united states military and who join with us as we witness and rejoice in the improvement of every single recipient that we have awarded
297723 saya kira tim kami sudah sangat kuat maka kami tak harus khawatir apakah akan mendapat tambahan pemain baru atau tidak persatuan kami juga sangat kuat dan tak seharusnya pemain baru akan merusaknya jika ronaldo bergabung dia harus menjadi bagian dari kesatuan itu dan tak peru ada yang berubah
297724 klub seperti real madrid selalu punya hasyrat untuk memperbaiki diri dan tim ini masih bisa ditingkatkan kualitasnya maka pemain baru boleh datang kapan saja asal mampu memperkuat tim ini
297725 media massa selalu membicarakan masa lalu dan apa yang telah kami raih tapi orang sekarang ingin tahu tentang masa depan klub kami para pemain tak perlu terpengaruh dan harus fokus pada tugasnyaa sebab isu dan wacana seperti itu wajar terjadi setiap akan menghadapi musim baru orang tak perlu menghabiskan tenaga dan waktu membicarakan minimnya pemain yang kami beli
297726 madrid selalu berjuang untuk memenangkan setiap trofi yang ada kami punya peluang besar untuk memenangkan liga champions musim ini kami harus punya mental juara di setiap pertandingan aku berharap kami bisa meraih kepuasan di akhir musim nanti
297727 thats probably the question i get the most from other riders is how do you ride
297728 she has to hold her line she cant cut across the track
297729 say theres something in the track she wants to move over she cant really move over if shes committed to that line
297730 the noise doesnt bother her so if youre behind her the pressures not there
297731 i dont feel it i dont hear it so it doesnt bother me
297732 i have to make sure shes not lying to me
297733 it was a mud race i didnt care i just wanted to ride i got fourth place out of 12 boys so it was really fun
297734 definitely in this sport you pretty much race against boys all the time
297735 once you get old enough at 12 years old you can ride with girls but i stayed in with boys as well i raced in the amateur national championship with boys
297736 i dont know if anything was really given to me i think i worked for it
297737 i think i just work hard and i practice a lot and i try to fix the things that are not right with my riding and keep making it better
297738 snowboarding is fun im not that good at that but i like it i like making videos with my friends texting
297739 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
297740 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
297741 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
297742 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
297743 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
297744 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
297745 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
297746 regions like ours across the nation are facing unique challenges related to a changing economy deteriorating housing stock and outdated infrastructure
297747 this is a great opportunity for western new york to directly influence national policies that can help create change that benefits older cities like buffalo jamestown lackawanna and dunkirk
297748 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
297749 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
297750 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
297751 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
297752 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
297753 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
297754 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
297755 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
297756 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
297757 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
297758 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
297759 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
297760 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
297761 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
297762 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
297763 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
297764 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
297765 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe

297773 speaker pelosi needs to hear loud and clear hardworking americans cant wait for gas price relief they deserve a vote on real energy security now

297784 thanks to everyone who came out last thursday th to celebrate a beautiful evening and help support our effort to have a dog park built at clarendon park
297785 das ganze war sehr professionell gemacht wir gehen davon aus dass die f lscher im ausland sitzen
297786 wir haben sofort die scheckkarten der kunden gesperrt die an dem automaten aktiv waren
297787 you did it you changed wild lament into whirling dance you ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers im about to burst with song i cant keep quiet about you god my god i cant thank you enough
297788 this morning i called my firstborn and could tell she was having a rough monday morning like many of us working girls she was trying to get her home in order after a busy weekend and still make it to her desk on time theres nothing like trying to be domestic goddess and employee of the week at the same time is there sister
297789 weaving on the go build your very own lap loom and warp it too
297790 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
297791 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
297792 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
297793 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
297794 in search of winning a that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
297795 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
297796 having a manager who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
297797 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
297798 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
297799 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
297800 she has a child a medical practice and still looks spectacular i just take my hat off to her i dont know how she does it
297801 i asked her if she had any tips and she gave me a really good piece of advice she told me to use the passion that i feel about acting and let it show in my character because martha would feel as passionate about helping people as i do about acting i could never see myself as a doctor
297802 martha has a totally different background to any of the characters ive played before im used to playing brash northern characters with an edge to them
297803 im quite a touchy feely person the directors were reminding me not to get so attached to stop waving my hands around i couldnt hug people it was hard to find that balance
297804 theres a real will they wont they tension between martha and robert that bubbles below the surface
297805 theyve been in a relationship before so they have a shared history and now theyre working together so it could either be completely disastrous or really wonderful if they do get together theres still sexual chemistry between them and hes a womaniser
297806 when we first dreamed up the idea of building tornado in 1990
297807 we entertained the notion that a whole generation of locospotters about a third of boys in any school class in the 60s and a few of their sisters were grown up and many with decent jobs all the a1s had been scrapped so we reckoned we could tempt mature enthusiasts into shelling out for one
297808 is that the project has involved people from all walks of life old and new technologies and its nurtured tremendous affection bordering on love
297809 life is too hard in the gobi with all the droughts weve been having
297810 you will see a lot of people on this road heading for the big festival in bulgan
297811 but weve had no time to train our horses and without training they can suffer even die you will see
297812 i might try to come for a day its a pity to miss the races and a bit of wrestling
297813 last year there were days when it hit minus 15
297814 be fast and strong you have run well since you were born on your feet keep running and be a good friend of mine
297815 and the song these things have never changed if genghis khan were here he would understand everything
297816 its good luck if a horse stands on your foot
297817 but we need to take care some of these horses are partly arab not pure mongolian as in the past they are bigger and faster and they win prizes are getting bigger and people are investing in winning
297818 not yet but it is coming and we need to get ready for that
297819 come on the wrestling is starting in the town stadium
297820 not much but there was a case of drug taking recently three wrestlers were disqualified for life
297821 what is that naadam is the biggest and the best
297822 im not sure many consumers will be able to fully take in the news that their gas bills are going up by well over a third
297823 we expect more rises within days however there is no reason for consumers to take this lying down by switching to eons capped tariff today an average household can fix their energy bill at todays prices until october 2009 this costs around 1 100 a year compared with the 1 400 or so now being paid by the average british gas customer we predict this could save a typical home 300 over the next year but we expect this to disappear within days this really is the last chance for households to avoid the energy price rises
297824 now most of the longest capped deals have gone theres a case for staying on the lowest internet only deals and see how things work out the cheapest internet only deal which requires customers to sign up and manage their accounts online is ironically british gass click 5 tariff
297825 british gas will increase the prices on click 5 at some point but they will still want it to remain competitive for the internetbased switching market
297826 how many trees can it eat in a whole day
297827 it seems individuals have succeeded in reining in their spending and riding out the tough times longer than anticipated but its unlikely to last
297828 the trickle down effect of the credit crunch wont truly hit personal insolvency figures for the next six to 12 months
297829 had been overtaken by the consumer who has overspent in recent years
297830 theres no point in feeling nostalgic its only paper and its still money
297831 its been particularly successful among older people who still have francs hidden away in drawers and cupboards and old wallets
297832 one man i know was going through the pockets of an old suit when he found 400f now hes going to come and spend it all
297833 its a difficult time people are looking more and more at the prices before they buy
297834 one lady found seven 200 franc notes in a suitcase a man came in after finding some old notes stuffed away in a briefcase another customer a widow had found some francs while going through her husbands wallet
297835 weve even had a call from one woman in the marne saying she had 20 000f shes going to come up this weekend and spend it
297836 stand for france while the euro stands well for europe
297837 even people of my generation do the sums in francs if theyre thinking of buying a house or a car
297838 you no longer have to show tourists where the cash machine is and they no longer have to do the conversion
297839 the french are very patriotic and the franc was always part of that
297840 but the euro is much more practical i dont think anyone would want the franc back for good
297841 the investigations revealed various characteristics which are often contained in claims of this type fictitious children who are often twins or disabled and apparently the claimant is self employed
297842 you know that custody is inevitable for the crime you have committed this was a wholesale assault on the benefit system
297843 hmm for some reason it makes me think of an old peoples home
297844 this is the cheapest house white and its very decent
297845 there are four of us that share this lab space
297846 their primary function is to block damaged blood vessels so if you cut yourself theyll form up and aggregate theyll stick together their surface becomes super sticky and theyll plug the hole
297847 pretty much all of us donate blood for our own experiments
297848 so i thought id come and train with the big doc
297849 i want to get into the mechanism of what causes a disease
297850 i didnt really want to spend my days with a bunch of sick people hearing them whining or whatever im not into that i want to figure out specifically what is causing the problem what are the molecules involved
297851 in the second year of university we started learning about the mechanisms like the coagulation cascade and platelets
297852 hearing them talk about clotting i just became fascinated by how a liquid could turn into a solid and then back again but there were certain pieces of the puzzle that i thought were still missing and they are still missing theres still a hell of a lot of research to do and i wanted to fill in some of those holes
297853 even making a solution or measuring stuff out youre doing boring stuff at times its very monotonous but in a way i kind of find that relaxing it is very much i think like being a cook those guys get to a certain level where they dont have to look at their cookbook and as a scientist you can get to a certain level where you can start being creative as well
297854 the higher up you get in science the less time you spend in the lab
297855 i try to get in several hours a day in the lab like 8 10 hours but it depends what kind of experiment youre doing you have to love what youre doing being a scientist
297856 definitely id have to say the best part of being a researcher is when you get a really significant breakthrough something that nobody else has seen before when youve measured something new thats the ultimate for me
297857 the really big discoveries are just something unusual that happens like im going to give this a try and you do it and then lo and behold you get something very interesting thats rare ok very rare
297858 and you keep in touch a lot by email and then read publications so you can see what people are up to
297859 the top journals are ones such as cell science and nature
297860 its very difficult to publish in those but we have one story now thats very very exciting and i think its going to move the field forward in the study of how the surface of platelets become sticky
297861 i have to write grants publish a lot demonstrate that im a good scientist then you get a chunk of money maybe four or five years or something in a way i like that struggle it keeps you hungry in science you have to develop a thick skin and you have to be persistent
297862 in academia youre free to work on just about anything
297863 as long as you can spin up a good grant you can work on it in industry my impression although ive never worked in industry im strictly academic is that youre more like a mercenary they figure out they want to discover a drug that inhibits whatever so then youre part of a team that focuses on that once thats done they can move you on to something else there is perhaps more security in that but the philosophy is very different and thats why i stick with academia
297864 they make things too complicated and dont explain things well but i blame journalists as well because they want a big story right
297865 like new drug found to cure cancer cancer will be cured in a couple of years what the journalist might not understand is that this is a very very small step towards finding a drug but maybe they sensationalise it make it bigger maybe its because of their naivety or perhaps its partly also because of the scientist who may have exaggerated thats human nature right it doesnt piss me off i just get to chuckle a little bit
297866 every year that goes up by about a thousand and when you get up to the higher levels like a full professor i dont know 50 grand sixty grand
297867 its nine to five but then theres a hell of a lot of stuff i have to do outside of those hours including everything i work id say 10 12 hours a day six days a week
297868 the higher up you get the more administrative stuff there is like health and safety it is important you have to do it but i dont really like that
297869 in this time you must how it is make yourself the animal boss
297870 theres always a discussion about how much of the relationship belongs to the individual and how much of the relationship belongs to the institution
297871 the understanding is that you may not initiate the conversation
297872 i think the builder thought i was going to get up every morning and go to work and come back late at night and leave him in peace but actually i was there all day
297873 being able to drop them off at school every morning is rare and its lovely to be able to do that it also allows you to take a breather and to reassess what you want to do with your career and reflect on some of the attitudes you carry
297874 the city is a very paranoid place at the moment theres no job security
297875 just because youre paranoid doesnt mean theyre not out to get you
297876 you get taken into a meeting room then taken out again and you dont know who is left at the end of the process
297877 these more than equate to any compensation that they could seek to recover for breaching the garden leave clause
297878 its just macho competitiveness to try to enforce these restrictions and garden leave clauses
297879 you hear stories about the nhs where consultants are on gardening leave for four years because theyve been charged with some kind of misbehaviour
297880 the health service is very nervous about publicity and there are times when theyll bend over backwards to avoid bad news getting out
297881 i was told to come in overnight when the staff werent there and take my things
297882 i would question the integrity of any firm that would make you work during that time because what are you going to do you cant trade youre not going to give them any interesting insights into the market all youre going to do is try and take information from them
297883 we may instruct an agent to visit your home to discuss repayment of your account
297884 there was no evidence of a fault with your furniture and it does meet the correct specifications
297885 we are looking into why this occurred with urgency but in the meantime are contacting your reader to arrange for a replacement and apologise for any inconvenience caused
297886 sought advice from the financial services authority and the financial ombudsman service both were satisfied our 30 compensation offer was adequate
297887 the way in which the policies were cancelled showed the firm focused on the financial cost to itself and did not properly consider the alternatives or the detrimental effect on customers
297888 funds appear to have been lent on non commercial terms with no clear benefit to ukli
297889 it is green belt land highly unlikely ever to be a city it is a beautiful open field in the countryside
297890 i cant believe they are continuing the same business model but from abroad
297891 i sadly encouraged friends of mine to follow my investment example now i would advise everyone to steer well clear
297892 the number of inmates is such a variable but were hoping to keep it around that 640 level
297893 its quite possible well hit that goal just about a week ago we had less than 640 inmates
297894 thats always something thats there depending on what the needs are
297895 if it looks like its going to be a long term issue and the need arises then i think the need to convert some of that shell space will come a lot quicker its always in the back of everybodys mind that this going to be something that were going to have to do some day
297896 this is a well built facility that will last for many many decades to come
297897 ultimately a jail exists for the protection of the public
297898 early in the planning stages for the trip to minnesota eric was going to join his brother
297899 however we were simultaneously scheduled to attend a scope review meeting on another project so we diverted eric to attend the meeting in philadelphia with our managing director from germany marc and alan went to viracon
297900 these gentlemen were valued for their camaraderie as well as their professional expertise the loss of their friendship and that of karen sandland of tishman construction will be keenly felt by all of us here
297901 marc was so excited about the trip and the opportunities it presented for our company
297902 he brought us all an energy and vitality to every aspect of his work and to the people here the spark he brought to all of us will be sorely missed
297903 it will take time but we are resolved to keep the projects they dedicated themselves to on target
297904 their work will be a legacy to the kind of people they were dedicated hard working and genuinely two of the best people any of us here at apg international ever had the pleasure of knowing
297905 marc rosenberg was a loving husband father and son who was dedicated beyond words to the people he loved
297906 he will be greatly missed by all who knew him this is a terrible thing that happened and there are many grieving for all those who perished in this accident
297907 this crash serves as a reminder that life is fragile precious and fleeting and we must make the most of the time weve been given
297908 all of new jersey will be keeping the families of those lost in their thoughts and prayers
297909 while our industry is large in some respects those of us who work within the industry either know one another or have very few degrees of separation between us
297910 so this has been a time of shock sadness and reflection for many of us within the industry our sympathy and prayers go out to the family friends and loved ones who have been affected by this tragedy including of course those within the revel organization
297911 wonder this time where shes gone wonder if shes gone to stay aint no sunshine when shes gone and shes always gone too long anytime she goes away
297912 maintains its exclusive and glamorous image through highly selective membership and door policy exclusivity is the forefront of everything exclusive members parties such as the cartier international polo guarantee that media attention remains focused and not disparate
297913 i found myself teaching so many people how to do it that i thought id advertise my services and do it properly
297914 because all you need is a couple of hours tuition and youre away
297915 the duration and intensity of the sound that reaches the ear is the overriding factor below about 80 decibels db almost no one gets noise damage but above that the damage is progressive each 3db doubles the energy reaching the ears and so halves the time it takes to cause problems
297916 loud discos are frequently at 95db and more and the continuous sound levels mean that the ears never have a chance to rest and recuperate
297917 prolonged loud music if you are taking severe exercise as there is evidence that low blood oxygen potentiates the damage caused by noise ie turn down the music when you are doing aerobics the same applies to intense dance in loud discos
297918 we dont want to miss it wheres our hand luggage
297919 all our luggage has been checked in weve just got our handbags
297920 she was six and a half stone frightened and angry when i called in the psychiatrists
297921 my mother was back and the lights were on we had the most meaningful conversation wed had in years about her coming out of depression and how she wasnt going back there
297922 we are getting on better than we have done for years i can see she is not away with the fairies just interpreting the present in the light of her past it has been worth the investment of time to tap into some key wellbeing themes from her life history
297923 she waltzes up the corridor to tom jones recalling the days when women threw their knickers at him she lights up like the person she is inside a glamorous divorcee with a gang of girls on a night out
297924 preferably until the tears run down her face she always expects to wear a woolly hat when going out since she believes she is cold and that winter is coming even though it is now summer indeed this inappropriate dressing was cited by professionals as evidence of her delusional state we have turned the hat into a prop for a running joke about benny the 70s soap opera simpleton from crossroads who is my mothers latest clandestine lover due to the dementia the joke is fresh every time and we now crack up merely by seeing the inappropriate woolly hat above all specal means i am no longer scared of dementia
297925 the drug left my father barely able to walk the hospital was full of shuffling ghosts one of the purposes of medication seems to be just to keep these people from going anywhere
297926 yes you can go home well phone your daughter to sort it out
297927 specal has been utterly empowering for me personally but above all it has enabled my mother to be reasonably contented
297928 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
297929 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
297930 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves

297952 the lawn and garden category has proven to be resilient in a difficult economic environment
297953 the timing and strength of the fall lawn care season will be the most critical factor in achieving our full year guidance
297954 citigroup represented that auction rate securities were safe liquid and cash equivalent securities these representations were false and had a severe detrimental impact on tens of thousands of citigroup customers

297958 dallas transgender advocates and allies have committed to a continuing a protest at crews inn a gay bar in dallas texas in response to the expulsion of a transgender woman from the bar on tuesday july 15 2008
297959 it is ridiculous to suggest for example that the anthrax assault may have come from some domestic disgruntled nut a timothy mcveigh with a germ
297960 you cannot register a channel that listens on a specific port more than once even though channels are registered on a per application domain basis different application domains on the same machine cannot register the same channel listening on the same port
297961 oh hallelujah our problems are solved we have banana bread
297962 a twizzler is not a sprinkle a jolly rancher is not a sprinkle perhaps in shangri la they are but not here
297963 why arent my images working in order for monotone to work with your images they need to be uploaded to your blog and then inserted into the posts from your media library if you are attempting to insert images into your posts and the images are stored on another web site it will not work

297965 hens love roosters geese love ganders everyone else loves ned flanders
297966 football helps to keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls
297967 the main cause for the chaos we see in western countries is the external factor the islamic interference through the centuries they exploited and suppressed non islamic states
297968 muslim countries chose to stay put even when we gained freedom meddling in our economic and domestic affairs because they wanted to expand their presence and exploit our intellectual and financial resources
297969 foreign intervention rendered the western world powerless to stop internal conflicts
297970 israel teaches its citizens to live peacefully with muslims so its a not question of occupation by these powers but seeking a confrontation with the jews by muslims
297971 there is no unity among western countries on economic or political views each of us takes our own path building a unity in views heavily relying on our own national interests
297972 these national interests often hampered efforts to unite western countries and such interests were mostly concerned with their relations with muslim powers
297973 many western countries were still attracted to their muslim counterparts thus always welcoming everything they had to offer
297974 we hope intellectuals can identify aggressions and can build a defense system against aggressions
297975 declare a clear stance against injustice by the muslim world
297976 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
297977 oye t mendigo d nde est el sabio que habita esta isla
297978 no lo s todo mundo viene preguntando por ese sabio y en esta isla hay tan s lo unas cuantas gentes como yo

297985 vale m s la sabidur a que las piedras preciosas y ni lo m s deseable se le compara
297986 porque dios no es injusto como para olvidarse de las obras y del amor que para su gloria ustedes han mostrado sirviendo a los santos como lo siguen haciendo
297987 pero si alguien hace pecar a unos de estos peque os que creen en m m s le valdr a que le ataran al cuello una piedra de molino y lo arrojaran al mar

297990 el se or te tom de la mano para abrir a su paso las puertas y dejas abiertas las entradas marchar al frente de ti y allanar las monta as har pedazos las puertas de bronce y cortar los cerrojos de hierro
297991 someter a su dominio y despojar de su armadura a los reyes
297992 encomienda a jehova tus obras y tus pensamientos seran reafirmados
297993 conf a solo en el se or y no te apoyes en tu prudencia
297994 dar a conocer la palabra de dios a todas las naciones
297995 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
297996 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
297997 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
297998 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
297999 we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
298000 returns a chart that looks like the following click on the picture to the right to view it full size
298001 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
298002 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
298003 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies

298026 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
298027 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy

298100 adem s de una necesidad acad mica y social se trata de actuar con coherencia pol tica
298101 se han aprobado leyes como la de violencia de g nero se est tramitando la de igualdad y el gobierno ha aprobado un plan de igualdad con todo ello ser a poco coherente que no llegaran esos cambios al mbito universitario donde la sociedad se juega tanto la lou ley org nica de universidades nos dejar a otra vez en el vac o
298102 y a todos los organismos que tengan que decidir sobre esto
298103 no se contemplen las leyes y medidas sobre igualdad entre hombres y mujeres
298104 promoci n de la igualdad de hombres y mujeres en el mbito universitario

298106 llevamos ya muchos a os trabajando en esto y hay m s de tres siglos de tradici n intelectual del pensamiento feminista el mundo va cambiando y la universidad sigue siendo un reducto impermeable
298107 creo que los pol ticos tienen inter s en actuar pero deben intervenir en el mbito universitario la autonom a universitaria a veces impide que se intervenga pero creo que eso se podr a revisar hay compromisos sociales
298108 la ley sobre violencia de g nero recoge la obligaci n de que estos asuntos tengan reflejo en el mbito universitario

298119 the air yeezy is inspired by kanyes love for high top designer shoes drafting from the collar molding seen in the air jordan v and featuring a thin midfoot strap hardly meant for support while originally conceptualized atop a dunk midsole the final version of the yeezy features the familiar shared tooling from the jordan iii and air revolution which most recently was also featured on jordan brands spizike and a lesser known model that deservedly flew under the radar the flight 48 its also the bulkiness of the shoes tongue that stands out most with west always opting to pop the tongue and leave the waxed laces loosely tied an ode to his tour the models outsole also actually glows in the dark as similar to a common glow stick if the shoe is held near light the familiar green glowing hue will radiate afterwards out from under the shoe this black glow colorway features a ridiculously high quality full grain leather along the heel quarter with rich suede making up the toe and midfoot overlays and patent leather highlighting the dominant midfoot strap

298125 my first goal in this endeavor is to showcase the wide variety and depth of artists working in denver and highlight the vibrant arts scene in town
298126 in my small way i am helping build denvers creative identity and enhance their position as an arts destination

298131 our criteria included a builder with a good reputation a unique floorplan and an attractive custom look
298132 it was also important that the home be in a family oriented community with good schools for our daughter the montessori school she now attends is great and we know that the douglas county school district is very good for when she is older
298133 the high quality of construction is evident throughout our home
298134 we also liked the many luxury features that are included with the home the large home site with the beautiful ponderosa pines also was a big selling point for us
298135 do what you love without actively monetizing it the money will follow
298136 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
298137 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
298138 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
298139 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt hit very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
298140 from the way we understand it the more rest the better hell be
298141 three days off not throwing it feels a lot better now than it did a week ago
298142 you may think i handled that rather well mummy but it was in fact only a baby wasp
298143 arent they meant to be growing out of this phase
298144 we can have a day together maybe for your 10th birthday
298145 because youve got two already not to mention their bizarre accessories and soon youll grow out of that and wish youd spent the money on something else
298146 to start too soon from a technical point of view is inadvisable
298147 you can get into bad habits or are put off completely
298148 if a child is told he has to learn nine out of 10 times its doomed to failure says julian barber who teaches piano by the time they get to 12 or 13 they almost invariably drop out
298149 the whole class is involved its not just two or three going off down the corridor to music lessons
298150 because children at that age are like sponges they soak up everything but it depends on the person
298151 the age when a child is ready varies from child to child and instrument to instrument between six and 10 is ideal but you have to take the advice of a specialist music teacher
298152 with a one to one session its really important that the relationship works
298153 and youve got to have a certain amount of natural ability and drive but if you want it go for it

298158 my highlights programme will be the last show of the day
298159 weve got 1 500 hours more coverage than we did in athens but only 30 more staff
298160 on the show im doing well be working round the clock weve only got a couple of reporters ill be on air at 2 00am local time probably get to bed about 5 00am
298161 every single person has had economy flights theres no lap of luxury
298162 there is that famous rule 51 in the ioc book which prohibits political statements in the olympic arena and i think most athletes understand that
298163 and youve got the worlds eyes on that stadium so it would be very difficult to hide anything thats going on in there
298164 what happens if theres a protest in the middle of beijing
298165 thats where the chinese are able to control things more forcefully id have thought then its going to be more difficult to get to these places and get pictures
298166 and ive been back three or four times since 2005

298168 i asked her if she was writing and she looked at me searchingly and asked how do you think of a novel

298171 i asked him whether lph wasnt heartbroken when he got married and he said well he did seem upset but i asked him to be best man
298172 because wire walking generally takes place in the circus it is assigned marginal status the circus after all is for children and what do children know about art
298173 its a moment of eternity and what brings me the most pleasure is the idea that so called normal people cant do it
298174 you stage on the wire the wildest spectacles about your life and your dreams
298175 and on this wire strung out at a vertiginous height between the sky and the void you send us eloquent messages of courage and lucidity
298176 but we both take great delight in things that are mischievous naughty and illegal
298177 it was about falling or the desire to jump off a building
298178 then i started thinking about walking in the air which has always been my fantasy
298179 most people on the ground thought it was a test and werent alarmed
298180 but i heard him shouting so i knew he was worried it was an awful moment
298181 and we didnt have time to do it again but thats life
298182 i may be making a virtue out of a necessity
298183 but i do think that had there been footage we would have seen it endlessly and therefore the act itself would have been diminished the only record is exquisite photographs the most important is the one thats out of focus of philippe smiling
298184 in the 20th century we had this ideal of futurism
298185 part of that was building cities in the sky in the 21st century people are more circumspect there is a consciousness of failure
298186 it says this in my holy book and so this is what i believe
298187 i must steer clear of dreary bourgeois art i must be avant garde and paint whats in my heart
298188 the end of an empire is messy at best this empire is ending like all the rest
298189 you have to remember youre playing a character this cannot affect juno it can a little bit but its lola thats f ed up and upset right now not juno
298190 if you want to do this go and see your competition
298191 um ok love this script but id have to be having sex for pretty much six weeks solid how do we feel about it

298194 without doping and without drugs in the true spirit of sportsmanship
298195 welcome to beijing people who have dreams are all bravo
298196 can the story of our foods and how we cook them really tell us who we have been
298197 the first all but destroyed by poverty and alcoholism the second redeemed by love and growing fame
298198 would like to see ray regarded as the great artist he was and not as somebody who had a terrible life that he wrote about

298203 thou shalt always kill got called a novelty record because of certain cultural references
298204 theres plenty of room for lightheartedness but were not a comedy act
298205 its going crazy at the moment because theres a big gap between the uk hip hop scene and what the public wants
298206 people like dizzee rascal came out with something revolutionary we were no longer going to pretend to be american but since then so much has been carbon copies now people want content they want to be challenged and made to think
298207 my mum has managed libraries for years but ive probably read 20 books in my life
298208 because of the emo music scene self harm seems to have become an acceptable thing
298209 just another thing where people say shes a teen thats what teens do i wanted to address it
298210 sometimes you have to go a few steps back to go forward
298211 50 cent the us rapper is supposed to have been shot nine times and survived that strand couldnt go any further you cant get shot 10 times and be alive so its time to go back a few branches maybe to gil scott heron and take another route thats what were trying to do
298212 charles ii used this vocabulary of gesture and gesticulation symbol and ceremony
298213 to assume that because charles ii enjoyed the corporal pleasures of life because he was a hedonist who gambled and had multiple affairs he must have been dismissive of royal rituals
298214 was unequivocal the king was not as other men but a priestly quasi divine being
298215 my lord you snore so loud you will wake the king

298230 that annual natural cycle essential for the survival of a hunter gather culture was revered in ceremony and song providing a basis for all endeavor
298231 its important not to romanticise excessively the nimiipuus relationship with the natural world as many sympathetic chroniclers of native americans have the image of the american indian as the irreproachable steward of an unsullied continent is a powerful one but what seems certain is that not just their spirituality but their survival did depend on a cautious management of the flora and fauna around them

298236 if you linger youll find the small farming communitys wide airy main street dominated by nailed up boards and broken windows hotels grocery stores and bars abandoned in what looks like a hurried careless exodus
298237 bent on survival the emigrants thought little of housekeeping every tree within miles of the trail had been chopped down water holes were fouled by rubbish and the swollen carcasses of cattle and horses and every creature that came within rifle range was felled

298254 the mayors philosophy was they really go hand in hand and you have to have a combined vision and thats still the case
298255 you really cant have a successful neighborhood without good business you cant have a successful business without a strong community
298256 in this case there were two finalists and the mayor could only choose between the two finalists that were forwarded on to him so if bill hadnt risen to the top during that process and hadnt been a finalist the mayor would not have had an option to make him an offer
298257 i think in the final analysis the reason that his decision went toward bill is that bill just has such a strong commitment to this community and such a strong knowledge
298258 he would hit the ground running because he already knows all the community groups he already knows all the neighborhoods in the city
298259 the key role that education plays in building strong neighborhoods

298268 but ultimately the responsibility of the tire rests with goodyear there has been times this year that the tire hasnt been all what we wanted it is a difficult tire to build but its goodyears responsibility to try and do it
298269 we need to find out why the tire rubber would not lay into the track
298270 when we get to the root of that problem we will be in good shape truthfully indy always wears tires out and no one knew we had a problem until after the end of the first practice

298272 you have 43 of the most competitive guys on earth
298273 youve got to take care of these competitors when it comes to the safety of these drivers who are driving off into these corners at 200 mph i supported them 1000 and applaud nascar for doing that
298274 i didnt feel like i was handed a race by any means
298275 i felt like i really had to go out there and race for it we put it all out there and raced hard for it i hope just like everyone that it doesnt happen again but with the circumstances we had i really think nascar called a great race

298360 just get the hell off americas lawn ya damn kid
298361 who is this new john mccain wheres the straight talker i went to sleep dreaming about
298362 the day after the bush administration announced it would hold a diplomatic meeting with iran the price of oil fell by over ten percent its been on the way down ever since thats because the two are tied together while bush and cheney were threatening war with iran the world got nervous and the price of oil went up when diplomacy was tried the price of oil went down americans are paying an enormous risk premium on oil and the more belligerent we are to the middle east the higher the price goes when barack obama said hed talk with iran he was denounced by the right wing when george bush actually followed obamas lead the price of a barrel of oil came down twenty five bucks in two weeks
298363 i see that president bush spoke the other day about iraq but what he failed to mention is that he didnt meet his own deadline for hammering out a status of forces agreement with the iraqis this is because the iraqis are demanding a timeline for u s troops to withdraw from their country just like barack obama has proposed while the white house continues to try to twist prime minister malikis arm into redefining the word timeline the chances that this law will pass the iraqi parliament by the end of this year become more and more dim as time goes on maybe bush should just get a three month extension so that the next president can bargain in good faith with the iraqis rather than try to force them into agreeing to something which their own people are going to reject
298364 you know when news organizations have been telling americans for months now that obama is light on details and offers no specifics they have never seemed to apply the same standard to john mccain finally the politico website has written about this leading the story off with quote the domestic policy plans of john mccain have been notably short on details unquote i look forward to the rest of the media following up on this story by pointing out over and over again that obama has concrete proposals whereas mccain has put forth numbers that economists agree dont add up when i hear that mccain is light on details and offers no specifics from the media then i will know they are doing an unbiased job once again but im not holding my breath waiting
298365 just imagine for one moment that barack obama had been involved with a banking scandal in his past now imagine further that his son just resigned an executive position of a bank that was on the verge of failure do you think we would have heard about this in the media perhaps on an hourly basis on the cable news shows over and over and over again then ask yourself why nobody seems to be paying the slightest bit of attention to andrew mccain or for that matter even mentioning the words keating five and yet somehow the media is supposed to be on obamas side it just boggles the mind
298366 given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people
298367 john mccains new campaign team trained by karl rove is throwing a lot of mud over barack obama being a celebrity even running an ad mccain said he was proud of featuring paris hilton and britney spears funny thing though mccain used to be proud of wearing the label celebrity himself on his own campaign site until they deleted it this week that is was an associated press story which ended with and i quote a political celebrity mccain is considered a top contender for the nomination unquote so john mccain should really decide whether being a celebrity is a good thing or a bad thing or maybe its just a good thing when mccain is being called a celebrity and its now a bad thing because hes calling obama a celebrity i honestly couldnt tell you what mccain is thinking these days since hes flip flopped on so many of these types of things
298368 the chairman of the republican committee who is supposed to be in charge of getting more republicans elected to the house this year just gave an astounding conference call with their candidates which even more astoundingly he let reporters listen in to in his own words republican approval ratings are quote worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority dont be afraid to say you are disappointed in fellow republicans dont hesitate to be anti washington d c unquote he was addressing republican house candidates at the time he even told them not to bother attending the republican national convention this year saying it would be a waste of time its not often i agree with republicans on campaign tactics but i would have to agree that attending the republican national convention would indeed be a waste of time for anyone

298379 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better

298390 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
298391 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge

298395 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
298396 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
298397 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
298398 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
298399 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
298400 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
298401 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
298402 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
298403 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
298404 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
298405 they can only make a small difference at the margins
298406 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
298407 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
298408 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
298409 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
298410 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
298411 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
298412 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
298413 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
298414 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
298415 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
298416 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
298417 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
298418 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
298419 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
298420 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
298421 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
298422 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
298423 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
298424 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
298425 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
298426 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
298427 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
298428 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
298429 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
298430 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
298431 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
298432 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
298433 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
298434 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
298435 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
298436 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
298437 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
298438 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
298439 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
298440 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
298441 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
298442 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
298443 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
298444 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
298445 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
298446 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
298447 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
298448 are you better off now than you were four years ago
298449 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
298450 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
298451 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
298452 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
298453 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
298454 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
298455 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it

298457 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
298458 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
298459 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
298460 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
298461 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298462 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
298463 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
298464 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
298465 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
298466 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
298467 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
298468 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
298469 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
298470 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
298471 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
298472 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
298473 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
298474 he just said we need to do all these things
298475 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
298476 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
298477 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
298478 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
298479 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
298480 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
298481 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
298482 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
298483 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
298484 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
298485 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
298486 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
298487 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
298488 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
298489 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
298490 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
298491 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
298492 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
298493 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
298494 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
298495 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
298496 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
298497 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
298498 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
298499 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
298500 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
298501 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
298502 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
298503 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
298504 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
298505 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
298506 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
298507 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
298508 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
298509 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
298510 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
298511 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
298512 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
298513 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
298514 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
298515 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
298516 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
298517 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
298518 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
298519 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
298520 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
298521 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
298522 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
298523 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
298524 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
298525 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
298526 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
298527 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
298528 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
298529 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
298530 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
298531 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
298532 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
298533 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
298534 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
298535 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
298536 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
298537 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
298538 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
298539 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
298540 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
298541 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
298542 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
298543 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
298544 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
298545 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
298546 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
298547 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
298548 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
298549 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
298550 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
298551 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
298552 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
298553 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
298554 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
298555 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
298556 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
298557 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
298558 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
298559 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
298560 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
298561 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
298562 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
298563 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
298564 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
298565 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
298566 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
298567 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
298568 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
298569 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
298570 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
298571 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
298572 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
298573 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
298574 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
298575 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
298576 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
298577 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
298578 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
298579 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
298580 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
298581 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298582 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
298583 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
298584 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
298585 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
298586 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
298587 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
298588 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
298589 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
298590 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
298591 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
298592 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
298593 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
298594 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
298595 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
298596 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
298597 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
298598 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
298599 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
298600 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
298601 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
298602 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
298603 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
298604 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
298605 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
298606 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
298607 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
298608 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
298609 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
298610 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
298611 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
298612 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
298613 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
298614 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
298615 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
298616 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
298617 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
298618 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
298619 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
298620 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
298621 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
298622 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
298623 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298624 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
298625 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
298626 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
298627 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
298628 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
298629 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
298630 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
298631 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
298632 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
298633 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
298634 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298635 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
298636 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
298637 theyve increased credit loss expectations for the past three quarters and this next one is probably going to be the fourth
298638 turbulent market conditions lie ahead would probably be an understatement
298639 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
298640 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
298641 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
298642 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
298643 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
298644 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
298645 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
298646 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
298647 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
298648 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
298649 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
298650 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
298651 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
298652 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
298653 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
298654 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
298655 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
298656 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
298657 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
298658 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
298659 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
298660 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
298661 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
298662 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
298663 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
298664 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
298665 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
298666 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
298667 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
298668 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
298669 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
298670 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
298671 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
298672 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
298673 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
298674 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
298675 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
298676 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
298677 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
298678 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
298679 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
298680 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
298681 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
298682 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
298683 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
298684 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
298685 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
298686 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
298687 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
298688 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
298689 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
298690 you know its not about you its about your country
298691 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
298692 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
298693 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
298694 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
298695 in fact i met with oil executives just a few days ago in california and the fact is that we can using existing facilities expand our oil production within months according to these executives
298696 in my view and that of oil company executives that ive talked to the people that actually do it not those that comment on television but those that actually do it we could in a very short time have a beneficial effect as we bridge the gap between our dependence on foreign oil and becoming energy independent
298697 so i disagree with those experts and ive talked to the actual people that do the work that are in the business that say within months and certainly within a very short time we could have additional oil supply for this nation
298698 it does take a long time to develop those resources
298699 john mccains proposal would not provide families with any relief this year next year five years from now
298700 believe me if i thought there was any evidence at all that drilling could save people money who are struggling to fill up their gas tanks by this summer or the next few years i would consider it but it wont
298701 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
298702 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
298703 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
298704 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
298705 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
298706 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
298707 even coal has a role to play if the carbon dioxide is captured and safely buried but clean coal does not exist right now
298708 but we cannot do the job with renewable and efficiency alone
298709 an expanded role for nuclear energy as well as natural gas and clean coal with carbon capture and storage
298710 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
298711 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
298712 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
298713 climate change and energy security are not just threats they are opportunities
298714 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can do
298715 a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what i think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do
298716 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
298717 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298718 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
298719 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
298720 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
298721 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298722 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
298723 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
298724 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
298725 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
298726 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
298727 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
298728 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
298729 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
298730 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
298731 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
298732 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
298733 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
298734 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
298735 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
298736 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
298737 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
298738 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
298739 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
298740 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
298741 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
298742 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness

298750 everybody whos been in a medical office knows about the privacy requirements
298751 these are the people who help make sure theyre kept and records are accurate its a great career for people who want to help the well being of people but do not want direct patient contact
298752 but the hands on part with patients it just wasnt me

298771 she has to hold her line she cant cut across the track
298772 say theres something in the track she wants to move over she cant really move over if shes committed to that line

298775 i have to make sure shes not lying to me

298780 i think i just work hard and i practice a lot and i try to fix the things that are not right with my riding and keep making it better
298781 snowboarding is fun im not that good at that but i like it i like making videos with my friends texting

298789 you say things in the heat of the battle right after because its an emotional sport
298790 i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list any more and he probably never will be
298791 if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way im still mad about it but im not going to go out there and wreck him or anything im a lover not a fighter
298792 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico
298793 i dont owe him anything i dont owe him more of an apology than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard
298794 the first thing that catches your eye is just how many people are here
298795 ive never been to a track on a friday where the grandstands are packed i dont know if canadians dont work on fridays or what but its really cool its a cool atmosphere and theres no other race that we go to thats like that
298796 the nice thing here is that there are some very long straights where you can drop down and pass
298797 coming through the first 15 20 guys will be easy then it will get harder the closer you come to the front
298798 this is the most difficult track that i race without a doubt its technical its very high speed the turns are very slow you get in there at 170 mph and then youre right back down to 40 mph on the turns

298804 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
298805 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
298806 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
298807 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
298808 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
298809 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
298810 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
298811 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
298812 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
298813 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
298814 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
298815 it doesnt really weigh on me you think about it but it doesnt really define who i am
298816 i respect the game of baseball i enjoyed my time as a player and i will continue to enjoy it the only i really know how to do is play baseball i dont have fortune 500 businesses and stuff like that you think about it every day and now i have an opportunity to reach that goal
298817 the most brutal ugly degenerate vicious form of expression it has been my displeasure to hear it manages to be the martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth
298818 god of abraham god of isaac god of jacob not of the philosophers and scholars
298819 this is huge its a giant step but its not enough to ensure that internet users are protected
298820 is the next step for the fcc to mandate that network owners must ask the government for permission before serving their customers by managing surges of information flow
298821 as a result of todays actions internet lawyers around the country are likely advising their clients to do just that
298822 we dont know if this is going to be crippling or really damaging
298823 foot in the door for big government to regulate the internet
298824 now that they have that foot in the door i fully expect that it will be exploited for everything its worth to grow the scope of the fccs coercive bureaucratic authority over all things digital
298825 right now consumers would rather postpone the decision than make a decision on a car purchase

298827 we might see some improvement when the 09 models start hitting showrooms but its not going to make up for these losses its not going to be until 2010 models start arriving more than a year from now that were likely to start seeing any significant recovery in the market

298852 the three of us were just standing there in shock and he just calmly looked at us with sunglasses on and dropped the head in front of us like it was no big deal
298853 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
298854 he picked the head up looked at the cops dropped the head and walked back to the body
298855 when attempts were made to have him exit and surrender to police were unsuccessful additional resources including the rcmp emergency response team and negotiator team were called in to assist

298891 chaudhary said his society was registered as madhuram co operative housing society the builder of this housing scheme is prime network private limited directors of the company are dharmendra patel his father chandubhai and mother prafulla
298892 a reason for this reluctance to part with control is that kedar bungalows common plot was becoming costlier now the common plot is priced at rs 150 crore it was then that the directors of the real estate company forged resolutions passed by the cooperative housing society and sold off four pieces of the common plot members of the housing society had then moved the court and got a stay order on june 28 they also filed a complaint with the district registrar of cooperatives at apna bazar in lal darwaja area

298898 when it comes to hdmi our testing has shown that given the complicated nature of sending high speed digital video transmission errors anywhere in the system accumulate
298899 therefore wire integrity routing and proper restoration of the video signals is critical additionally we have equipped the bvhd 10 with a unique data display channel ddc correction circuit that insures that the hdmi signal is accurate on the outputs an led indicator takes the guesswork out of trouble shooting by indicating when there is a fault in the system

298907 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
298908 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows
298909 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
298910 john mccain has unleashed a withering television commercial interweaving clips of paris hilton and britney spears with footage of barack obama addressing 200 000 germans in berlin a week ago in an apparent attempt to portray the illinois senator as a bimbo celebrity with more smile than substance
298911 just so you know were ashamed that the president of the united states is from texas
298912 just so you know were on the good side with yall we do not want this war this violence and were ashamed that the president of the united states is from texas
298913 maines remark sparked intense criticism many americans believed that she should not criticize george bush on foreign shores
298914 one dose of hillary is worth four trips to the chiropractor she is a dedicated yogi with an amazing ability to usher our bodies into alignment a young powerful knowledgeable servant of anusuara yoga
298915 hes still not sure how they knew to call him
298916 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
298917 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
298918 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
298919 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
298920 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
298921 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
298922 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
298923 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
298924 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
298925 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
298926 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
298927 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
298928 im not a great putter but im not a bad putter
298929 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
298930 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
298931 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
298932 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before
298933 if a man is called to be a streetsweeper he should sweep streets even as michelangelo painted or beethoven composed music or shakespeare wrote poetry
298934 i came in here with a good attitude just like i did coming in as a rookie in denver
298935 just grind from the bottom and i think i have a good chance because i know the offense just coming from denver so i think i have a good chance to come out there and compete
298936 its an easy call for us because he understands what were doing and he knows the system so he can walk out here and go
298937 hes got some talent there is an opportunity for him as we get chris brown healthy well just see how it goes
298938 you go through the season and as a coach you feel like you have a pretty good young player and you get upset with yourself cause you dont quite pull the trigger and get them in there
298939 toughness is his biggest attribute what i see that is going to be the difference in him being a great player to me is the game just understand the game understanding what offenses are trying to do to him if he reaches that point i think hell be a great player
298940 you got guys with their cell phones their sidekicks youtube whatever the heck that stuff is
298941 shoot when i got in the league we used to have calling cards we didnt have cell phones you met somebody out for dinner you hope they were there or you better go find a pay phone
298942 i thought i could do it and ive had a little rough patch i could almost get cut every year i just got lucky enough and stuck
298943 im nervous its my livelihood i dont want to give it up yet so you got to worry about it its got to be in the back of your head im going to give you my best every day in practice and preseason games and hopefully its good enough to help this team
298944 you talk about a guy who is having a heck of a camp were starting to play him a little bit at center too just because we havent prepared for suiting seven guys on game day hes a player who got an opportunity did a heck of a job when he got the opportunity cant get him off the field

298958 im thinking im trying to help my friend clark whos trying to help me out of financial straits doing something as innocent as getting rid of somebody who is a pain in the butt
298959 the doctor does not believe that i need surgery and is sending me to work with a specialist in arizona next week to do extensive rehab and strength work and he believes that i should be ready to play in two to three months
298960 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the us open i think this will be the first grand slam i have ever missed
298961 altchek looked at all my tests from april and today and informed me that i have been playing with a moderate tear in my rotator cuff tendon since april
298962 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury
298963 you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
298964 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
298965 i got worried and started walking through the paddock and found more deer i went round and there was 1080 everywhere
298966 she just sat with it crying while it called out no one should have to witness that
298967 it was my fathers and my understanding that the paddocks were excluded
298968 it is a huge disappointment that we are losing the native birds and now our herd
298969 im not happy to accept this at all im not happy with how this has been handled its a severe case of mis communication
298970 the bait was shifted or wayne and his father mis communicated
298971 if its our mistake but i dont believe it is we will look after them its a sensitive issue at the moment
298972 and he is not an elitist though he has the education to be
298973 its the proudest moment i have had for a very long time something that happens once in a lifetime
298974 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
298975 the first reason is his name the second is he wasnt born here
298976 marks the opening of a new era in our journey as a nation an era of political and economic reform and increased prosperity
298977 this guy just took a knife out and started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
298978 he must have stabbed him 50 or 60 times there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
298979 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock
298980 then he tried to drive off but the bus driver disabled the bus somehow from the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
298981 we were watching zorro the next thing i know i hear someone screaming
298982 by the time the police had arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
298983 at 1 28 am the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in custody
298984 he has a lot of friends all very upset hes gone
298985 they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
298986 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
298987 crack cocaine is the number one substance of abuse for our antiguan clients followed by alcohol it was the influx of crack that caused members of the community to approach clapton in the first place and it is still very visible particularly in some parts of the island which is leading to crime
298988 and i have no idea how many guns are here crime is spiking all over the caribbean these homicides here with young people involved they are usually drug related
298989 guns are in the wrong hands and these people have become trigger happy
298990 and i am in favour of the death penalty crack five necks and i believe many more will get the message
298991 i was brought down here to build a police force and we are finding a lot of good officers people who are intelligent and who want to work hard
298992 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
298993 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
298994 crack cocaine is the number one substance of abuse for our antiguan clients followed by alcohol it was the influx of crack that caused members of the community to approach clapton in the first place and it is still very visible particularly in some parts of the island which is leading to crime

298999 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
299000 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
299001 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
299002 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
299003 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
299004 it was sort of this a ha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
299005 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
299006 not only increasing their offensive capability but also their defensive capability
299007 the eclipse is a natural phenomenon i know it was also said to mean bad luck for our nation in old times but i prefer to think it means the end of bad luck
299008 china has had a lot of accidents i think it is the end it should be the end we can go on better in future i hope
299009 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
299010 it was sort of this a ha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
299011 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
299012 not only increasing their offensive capability but also their defensive capability
299013 it was an honest mistake and he tried to explain it to them my fathers quite elderly hes in no state at all to be doing a runner
299014 putting people in bed is not a benign kind of thing
299015 my amendment seeks to bring some additional focus on the barbaric cruel and hideous crime of chinas coercive population control program
299016 the government of the peoples republic of china to abandon its coercive population control policy which includes forced abortion and involuntary sterilization
299017 tragically but predictably the olympics have been the occasion of a massive crackdown designed to silence and put beyond reach all those chinese whose views differ from the government line
299018 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
299019 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
299020 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
299021 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
299022 i made it my prayer and my hope that this is the end of it
299023 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
299024 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
299025 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely
299026 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
299027 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
299028 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo led to his untimely death
299029 his family cant get him back and the answers still arent there
299030 coming by you always wondered who it was if they were still out there were they going to repeat what they did
299031 so its nice to be able to put a period on this
299032 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
299033 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
299034 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
299035 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
299036 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely
299037 look dr hatfill may have told some tall tales at some time in his life but that doesnt make him the anthrax killer
299038 i think what happened in this case was that the government overreacted
299039 they took things seriously that were never meant to be serious
299040 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
299041 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
299042 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
299043 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
299044 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbour
299045 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
299046 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
299047 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
299048 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
299049 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
299050 i continue to believe that the state should refrain from being overly prescriptive in specific school curriculum beyond establishing rigorous academic standards
299051 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
299052 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
299053 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
299054 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
299055 the priory is accessible to everybody regardless of wealth the priory can provide services at any time to any member of the public
299056 i would never know whos in it chinese walls in this business are very robust
299057 you cant stop photographers standing outside the hospital we will absolutely not permit photographers access
299058 i will never forget my first day of the 56 in the intake i was the only guy
299059 i can remember even now my first experience as a psychiatric nurse and this old guy who was completely distraught i can still remember the relief i was able to bring him
299060 most ceos in healthcare are accountants who have bolted on the nursery bit im the reverse
299061 i was managing director with an agreement with john that if he ever decided he wanted to depart he would give me the opportunity to launch a management buyout
299062 i decided that as i had never had it i wouldnt miss it
299063 i got a phone call and was told dont go on holiday for six months come and see the business
299064 ive been recruited for two reasons to grow the business and take it forward into additional new business streams and to improve the performance of the existing core business
299065 our greatest desire is to bring people in put them through a programme in the shortest time frame and have them discharged
299066 its been an interesting experience but i think were winning hearts and minds
299067 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
299068 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
299069 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
299070 weve been arguing for 7 years with the government that it was someone in their employ in ft detrick
299071 at least they had a name and at least it is from where we thought all along
299072 its very curious to me that they maintain they had enough information to arrest this guy and they allowed him to walk around and put pressure on him until he commits suicide
299073 they have a scapegoat they have a dead guy they could close their file they could close their investigation
299074 i was just thinking about his smile and i miss his smile
299075 the man was such a good man and it just brings everything back
299076 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
299077 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
299078 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
299079 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
299080 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
299081 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
299082 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
299083 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
299084 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
299085 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
299086 i cant believe it i cant believe it finally some justice
299087 the basis under which you granted the bond was absolute misinformation
299088 theres no question that the information given to me in the bond hearing was incorrect
299089 given the severity of the sentencing im revoking this bond
299090 this guy had all the incentive to take off knowing what he would face in prison so to know that there was nothing holding him here that his family wouldnt suffer one bit if he skipped town thats an enormous screwup
299091 to have no oversight on a bond is hard to imagine
299092 what would stop someone from broward county from walking in and saying i have 1 million worth of property so just believe me you have to wonder what kind of checking system the courts in broward county have
299093 this guy was tried and found guilty of what he did
299094 he is the worst of society my son must move on with his life and im glad that judge gold is finally helping us do this
299095 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference
299096 i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened it just didnt go straight today but my iron play was the same and i putted decent
299097 i feel much much better with the putter much better with the wedges he said
299098 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i havent been performing the way i expected and this week it feels much better i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around
299099 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum he said
299100 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
299101 im going to play my heart out and not really be concerned about how phil does hes going to be focused on his game i hope we both have a good day singh said
299102 firstly robbie coming in and the new coaching staff there was a time of getting to understand each other
299103 now we know exactly what we are trying to achieve we have been improving
299104 the mindset is to bring everything you can to the performance and thats what everyone has been doing whether they have been playing for 50 test matches or their first few test matches
299105 guys have been bringing whatever they can to the performance of the team thats the mindset if you do that hopefully that will contribute to a positive result
299106 and whats been really good about this group is we are pretty tight weve been spending a lot of time with each other
299107 that was a real grind and i suspect this weekend could be that it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama

299113 the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck
299114 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
299115 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
299116 the market gets bigger as you go down so of course you want as big a market as possible
299117 the customers have created new ways to use us because there is an enormous pent up demand for personal travel
299118 we put the personal back in travel you control your own travel
299119 as more and more people use us more and more are closer to the pickup point and we reduce our non revenue hours
299120 could you operate the taxis in new york city if you had only 50
299121 some people say water on mars means intelligent life more likely
299122 you know i immediately get the news the second anything happens i read it and had to sit down and kind of breathe a little bit
299123 the media drove me crazy that day wanting comments and i didnt want to give any more attention to that jerk
299124 i kind of took the high road and kept talking about healing prevention
299125 and if he would like he can join me in the ring sometime on the wwe ill show you what i really think
299126 how did this partnership come about other than you wanted a hot girl at the wwe
299127 jennys got a great cause we can provide a bunch of eyes and ears a bunch of people that might not know the ins and outs of autism
299128 i think a great way for an apology is to be sat down and educated about it
299129 id love to just quietly sit down with him and educate him on the facts it was clear he doesnt know anything about autism
299130 unfortunately doctors were unable to reattach it after recovering it from the alligators belly
299131 weve lost huge proportions of what was formerly the trail in the park its disappeared gone
299132 were not as worried about the flash flooding as we are about the instability of the ground and the slumping and the cracks appearing all along that entire
299133 weve had lots of hard rain in the south part of baffin island in the last five days so we dont know what this is doing to further destabilize melting permafrost because this is what is causing the erosion
299134 oh our recruiting department usually handles that and they dont take phone calls
299135 its not fun until the police tell us to shut up
299136 the fact that im here has helped me understand many many things
299137 i fell on this site that explained that there were mistakes here in st johns
299138 this is certainly not what we set out to do
299139 we have apologized to the patients for the stress and anxiety that they have gone through and we continue to do that
299140 the point is yes the outlook in the u s is weakening but with that said sun is underperforming against that backdrop
299141 when youve got a 100 million customer that is not going to be growing its it purchases but instead take it down 30 percent thats a lot of customer acquisition to make up
299142 theres no question the challenging u s macro environment has hindered our ability to grow the top line and weve got a greater share of our business in the u s than many of our peers
299143 i love happy endings some of you can remind me of some of them later
299144 disney wants to allow plenty of time for the post production of prince of persia considering that the tentpole will require extensive special effects to create its fantasy world and set pieces
299145 for the first 24 hours i was pretty numb i didnt know what to do i couldnt tell anyone
299146 you have language barriers you have immigration problems you have the church who by the way i dont see anywhere in this fight you have that social stigma among the many latinos who are married but still gay no one wants to talk about the problem
299147 these younger guys run a really high risk of infection
299148 we dont want them to get caught up in all that and become a statistic
299149 sometimes its as simple as teaching people about how to use a condom
299150 what we do is put it in their head that they need to start having safe sex
299151 for a lot of black people its a down low movement you know a lot of brothers dont want to talk about it they dont want anything coming back to them
299152 and a lot of brothers are just afraid to get tested too
299153 a lot of them think theyre educated about this and then a lot of them go out and never get tested cause they dont want to know what they have
299154 a lot of people are with the wrong people for the wrong reasons
299155 she looked up at me and smiled and said oh yes mom id love a bowl of oatmeal in a funny voice
299156 just looked at me like he thought i was crazy but when he sees it works hes totally on board
299157 for me yogi parenting is a way of being more than a thing you do its a place to come from an approach to parenting
299158 let me see it lets work on helping this now
299159 you bring that child into the present instead of letting them relive the past
299160 it brings them into the moment and i find they relax

299178 we actually presented our results recently showing a positive effect with zometa and helping decrease the number of cancer cells in the bone marrow in women with localized breast cancer

299190 her father was picking her up as a result of this fear but arrived as he described 30 seconds too late
299191 since the assault the girl describes a number of difficulties this includes fearfulness of being assaulted again and this has caused her not to attend the school since the assault

299193 stamping out bullying is one of the big tests we face in education and its time morris iemma appointed a full time education minister
299194 the government must immediately find the funds for another 700 school counsellors our teachers are doing their best but they are not professionally trained to look out for the warning signs in bullying victims or to change the behaviour of bullies
299195 investors have penalized rupert for his acquisition of dow jones which continues to be hampered by the deteriorating fundamentals of the print newspaper business
299196 the economy has severely dampened the demand for advertising and that could continue for some time
299197 given the decline in newspaper valuations since the acquisition it appears news corp could have gotten it a lot cheaper what was the rush
299198 while we cannot defend the price paid for dow jones nor can we fathom why news corp has continued to operate own the money losing new york post for years understanding the components of news corp s business highlights stark differences with pure play u s newspaper stocks which should drive a less negative view
299199 newspapers are simply not a reason to avoid owning news corp shares particularly at todays valuation
299200 were really excited that were owned by news corp its a very diverse global operation
299201 as a standalone dow jones was a 1 8 billion company access to capital was limited now access is still not easy but we would not have been able to make the acquisitions we just made

299206 colonel bouley had recently celebrated his 20th year wearing the uniform and had more than 4 200 flight hours in the f 15 eagle the royal air force f 3 tornado and the t 38 talon
299207 he was a decorated warrior an inspiring leader of airmen and a loving father and husband he served his country with distinction and will be greatly missed
299208 the air combat command accident investigation board will collect and protect evidence from the scene and gather and analyze all relevant data
299209 as commander of this wing the safety of our airmen is at the top of my priority list
299210 protecting our nations sons and daughters is a sacred trust and we intend to do everything in our power to find the cause of this mishap so we may prevent it from happening again

299215 it was just after halloween on monday morning at 4 30
299216 i heard this commotion at the door and grabbed my fishing gun a little 22 revolver to see what was going on
299217 i got to the front door and this fellow had ripped my security door out of its frame he said youre going to have to kill me im coming in
299218 i was about four feet away from him when i shot
299219 looking back now im glad he didnt die but that boy had the hardest head ive ever seen the bullet bounced right off

299224 last year yahoos board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly re examine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance
299225 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
299226 at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders the value inherent in yahoo s unique collection of assets is truly extraordinary
299227 tom lantos the late congressman from silicon valley said in session that yahoos leadership are the equivalent of moral pygymies i would agree to that although that would be denigrating to the pygmies
299228 you have 22 board meetings other than yahoos to attend each year
299229 we would prefer that you spend less time doing other companies business and focus more on the job at hand here
299230 probably the hardest worker at yahoo and one of the smartest people we know shes tireless we get 3 a m emails from her shes very capable and capable people can do more than others
299231 her connections with other companies like intel and costco are very important for our company her work on those boards does not affect her work as president at all
299232 the company is too bloated right now they need to reduce head count and divest some of their holdings that arent making any money
299233 the board has people that have been on too long when youve been on for 10 years or more you cant be objective anymore
299234 yes it would have been a great deal for the shareholders and for the company
299235 we should have taken the deal but i dont think its completely dead i believe theyre microsoft will come back around next year and try again
299236 it shows our basketball program is developing and we dont need other help from other places i think that is a big accomplishment
299237 newfoundland and p e i came in thinking they were going to walk all over us and i think we caught them off guard because we came out running
299238 they were on their heels and we were hitting our shots
299239 if we accomplished it before we know we can do it again and i think it is a realistic goal that we have to focus on
299240 we have a great attitude towards the team and i think we will do well
299241 we have a really nice group of guys on our team and i expect these guys to play as hard as they can every time they step on the floor
299242 i expect them to represent basketball yukon in a positive manner
299243 considering the huge advantage the other places have in terms of population
299244 if you look at p e i they have four maybe five times our population so for us to even be competitive with them i think is a huge accomplishment i think it shows how hard some of these kids have worked over the years to become basketball players
299245 but at this point its more of a seasonal slowdown which we havent had in the last couple of years because the market was so heated
299246 but normally we have a spring market and a fall market and theres lulls in between
299247 but theyre still 10 per cent higher than they were a year ago and in some cases more
299248 and theres still a strong demand but theres more properties available right now so theres not the real urgency there was two or three years ago
299249 it wasnt uncommon to get five per cent above the list price
299250 and our sales are the same or slightly less so that means inventory is building theres more selection and less urgency to make a decision so people arent making multiple offers and driving the prices up
299251 basically theyre saying well let your payments be a little higher but you need to show a certain amount of savings before well insure your mortgage
299252 but obviously the higher prices go the more people you shut out from being able to purchase
299253 after this fall were out of new single detached properties and well see the effect of that this fall and next spring
299254 we could really see the prices escalate and even more people will be shut out
299255 the people that are at the lowest end of the scale income wise in the yukon couldnt ever consider purchasing a home and are really struggling with the current rental costs
299256 directly to the provision of affordable housing in the north
299257 the committee is recommending the federal government get back into dealing with public housing they used to work co operatively with provinces and territories but once they pulled out the provinces and territories fell like a house of cards
299258 the only encouraging thing that were hearing is the peak has been reached or passed in some of the hotter southern markets
299259 some house prices are beginning to drop so that eventually may have a positive impact nationwide
299260 we already know that approximately 25 of men and 9 of women in the middle age bracket in australia stop breathing during sleep at least five times per hour
299261 however because sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity and its related diseases it has been difficult in the past to produce clear evidence that increased mortality is a result of osa and not because of other established causes
299262 that evidence is now available and shows that moderate to severe sleep apnea is associated with about five times the risk of dying after you control for other factors that are already known to cause premature death
299263 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
299264 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
299265 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group
299266 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
299267 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
299268 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
299269 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
299270 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
299271 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

299290 fenerbah e are the peoples team in turkey alone they have 30 million supporters they are a big big club it is worlds apart from playing for bury or brighton i turn up for training and see roberto carlos or stephen appiah and think wow i used to watch these guys on television
299291 roberto helped me a lot when youre young and people tell you things you think why is this guy telling me to do this but when roberto carlos tells you to run back you remember that hes played 118 champions league games won three champions leagues three world cups you go to his house and there are pictures of him with pel

299327 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
299328 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
299329 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
299330 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
299331 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack

299349 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
299350 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned

299352 rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it

299381 i did not hear an explosion just the crash of the masonry falling and the sound of breaking glass as the ticket window disintegrated
299382 there was blood all over me everyone was running shouting and screaming
299383 people were coming out of the station with blood streaming from their wounds
299384 one middle aged man was carried to an ambulance with blood pouring from a severed leg
299385 at first there were just a few flames coming out from the side but within minutes of us being here the whole lot just went up and the whole building was on fire
299386 there was a huge explosion and then a tremendous tornado of flames we heard all the glass breaking and people rushing out from the building screaming
299387 this was a 100ft high uncompartmented building therefore there were no barriers to stop the fire spreading
299388 it would also appear at this stage that the building material assisted in the spread of the fire
299389 i am very pleased but i think that all that will happen is that the police or the government will not be caught with their trousers down again
299390 any safe guard they bring in will just be to ensure that no one will catch them doing it

299402 but i dont think that if the air quality was at that level that the ioc would even allow for the competition to take place
299403 i came home and saw it had smashed our solar collector and i could see this tree sitting on the roof
299404 i went around the back of the house and i could see it had just crashed right through down through the roof and popped out windows
299405 the corner of the house has just been sheared off
299406 this one smashed on to the roof of the kitchen and made one of the windows explode with glass so we were very lucky we werent in there
299407 it was a very very frightening experience for me and the kids
299408 i thought it would only get a couple of hundred views i didnt think it would go mental like that
299409 a policeman came up to me and said buy a lotto ticket
299410 you never have quite enough time at work and you never have quite enough time at home
299411 its been a reactive business rather than proactive but thats actually really worked
299412 hr has become increasingly more complex over the last 10 years so companies are really needing that support
299413 rather than being the ambulance at the bottom on the hill we tend to be the ambulance way back up the cliff
299414 weve got reach right outside of nelson and the great thing is that we can be corporate or we can be small business
299415 nelson is becoming a big export producer of talent and thats just the way it is i see it because i travel every monday tuesday wednesday
299416 a larger number of low income borrowers will benefit from premium reductions than moderate middle and upper income borrowers combined
299417 maybe not so much for its cost and its cost will be up there this one is huge simply because of its scale and the number of people affected
299418 it seems that nelson marlborough has taken the biggest hit from the strength of the wind other areas are dealing with lots of water and flood damage
299419 as a result of the pipeline being down and damage to the storage tank at thompson terrace staff have worked through the night to fix the problem and were quite confident we have sorted it out
299420 there is a lot of attractiveness to thinking about staying put and making changes to the current home
299421 based on everything out there im going to hunker down and make the best of my current living conditions
299422 in the boom times three years ago when there was more of an abundance of appreciation and consumer confidence you might have expanded your dining room made it a little bigger
299423 today maybe youre putting in crown molding recessed lights or putting in a bay window
299424 a lot of people are saying let me think about it
299425 if all of a sudden we move into the spring and theres an uptick in consumer confidence they will flip the switch and go
299426 ive heard from a lot of builders that households will come in and negotiate aggressively
299427 but then when the household isnt willing to be as aggressive on the sale side of the current home that apparently jinxed a lot of deals
299428 be aware of how much the home will appreciate or depreciate based on the remodel
299429 the jurys really still out on how summer visitation will be how people will respond to gas prices and what it will mean for us
299430 but theyre very important to their communities and people put in a lot of volunteer time and effort just to keep them going
299431 its a complex financial situation out there for a lot of museums
299432 and theres no question that house museums are facing some unique challenges these days
299433 were absolutely accepting loans where borrowers have credit scores in the 600s
299434 theres no question that the stronger the credit of the borrower the better product they can obtain
299435 but there is a matrix based on the credit score and the down payment
299436 if you put down 5 percent youll need a credit score of at least 660 but if you go with an fha loan you can put down 2 25 percent and allegedly theyll take a 580 credit score
299437 with a credit score over 700 you can still get 100 percent financing
299438 in the calendar year 2006 bank of america originated 1 5 billion of fha loans in april 2007 we originated 1 1 billion in fha loans
299439 with the changes fha has made over the past year it has become a sweet spot for us
299440 someone in a first or second job out of high school or college who is working and can afford the property but might need help with the down payment
299441 with fha a parent can provide the down payment assistance as long as the borrower can afford the payment
299442 then carefully check the interest calculation interest is paid in arrears so the last mortgage payment you made actually paid for the prior months interest you will need to add enough interest to cover the time it takes your funds to reach the lender if the amount you send is short the lender will return your payoff as insufficient overpaying is safe as they will refund the difference
299443 call to verify the payoff has been received in virginia the lender has 90 days to either record the release documents at the courthouse or return them to you for you to record
299444 when you see that water once it doesnt get any bigger or better
299445 i consider it just more acreage i can look out on
299446 when i retired i swore id never eat anything that didnt come out of my garden or the water and i havent
299447 we try to understand what and who that user is and thats not easy to do
299448 theyll need health services education entertainment we look at what they need for medical emergency care a lifestyle that supports healthy living with fitness centers for example emergency and acute care assisted active living and assisted living and retirement
299449 function and value in an integrated design that would facilitate their participation in the lifestyle of the community
299450 we have to understand the consumer and not just replicate what weve done before
299451 theyre living longer smarter and healthier lifestyles so we offer a lot of staged amenities we engage the current population of the community and ask what we could provide differently we try to keep function spaces as flexible as possible we even get them involved in focus groups this helps in smaller communities and even larger communities
299452 our customer is really different they want a community its not just all about the house
299453 they could probably find the same house from the same builder two miles up the road in a standard subdivision and it would be cheaper our customer is really looking for that tranquil peaceful environment where i can hang out with my friends place
299454 everyone has raved about how beautiful the house is but everyone has equally objected to the back yard
299455 while i know that having virtually no back yard is a hindrance its not totally uncommon in our neighborhood and houses with equally unusable back yards have recently sold
299456 we also back up to the back of my neighbors house last spring we planted some trees to help screen the neighbor but im at a loss as to what else to do
299457 there isnt really much that can be done about the amount of green space that exists currently in the back yard however a great deal can be done to soften the deck
299458 currently the space is being architecturally dominated by the home deck and fence with the main focus being directed towards the small piece of grass between the deck and fence
299459 its such a rich life here with so much to offer people ive never wanted to move out of greenbelt
299460 many renters are under the same economic duress as owners
299461 we understand why members of congress would want to put more goodies in homeowners baskets
299462 i was about 18 and made 15 cents an hour
299463 my brother in law would go fishing at 5 a m catch bass this big
299464 then hang them up in the market and give them away
299465 that one lane plank bridge had a musical chime to it
299466 i went to sleep in occoquan and woke up in woodbridge
299467 one afternoon i had three cows in my back yard eating my grass
299468 we expect you to stand by your quote if the information provided by the borrower is accurate
299469 it was the peak it was the embodiment of business success
299470 we underestimated the bubble even though deep down we knew it couldnt last forever
299471 mr tanner not only took advantage of these good people and their intentions to give to charity he was also taking advantage of his daughter and in many ways training her to be the next generation of criminal in this case
299472 we can only hope he has not done too mach damage to that young lady
299473 in terms of the interest of the party i think he should definitely step down as the chair of the cuyahoga county democratic party even if hes completely innocent of these charges he understands or should understand that appearance makes a big difference
299474 the apu allows the driver to shut the engine off on the truck turn the apu on he is gonna get air conditioning or heating at the time its gonna use one tenth of a gallon per hour compared to the gallon gallon and a half
299475 first and foremost was driver comfort second by allowing us to operate more efficient we are able to pass those savings to the customer
299476 its a win win for everybody and thats something you dont see very often in trucking
299477 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
299478 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
299479 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
299480 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
299481 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
299482 improves bd java compatibility to enhance interactivity with some bd roms
299483 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
299484 where we are today is the result of a development cycle from 18 months ago
299485 18 months ago psp hardware wasnt doing quite as well in terms of sales since then its taken off weve been talking to a lot of developers and really trying to change their thinking about how psp is doing and theyve realized it from what theyve seen at retail
299486 going towards the end of the year and going into 09 and beyond were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties
299487 theyre going to be a bit of a surprise theyre going to be like wow thats coming to psp
299488 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
299489 while you might think gamers purchase fewer movie discs than others we didnt see any significant evidence of that in our results
299490 ps3 console shipments will go a long way to help bring down manufacturing costs and drive down blu ray player prices
299491 we expect that blu ray player prices will remain above 300 for tier one models for the remainder of this year
299492 i t may seem semantically anomalous to speak of a new trial following summary judgment which is a determination that there shall be no trial at all
299493 it entices people to come to big firms who really dont want to do what we do
299494 just being successful and a partner in a firm is not enough of a motivating tool
299495 i have friends who are fourth year associates at other firms who are sitting in the library researching
299496 this group wants to grow professionally and advance to partnership but not while compromising their personal lives
299497 it may be more in the eyes of the observer than in the associate
299498 they are more willing to sit back and wait for things to happen to them instead of making them happen for themselves
299499 they are willing to turn down work they dont want to do they dont volunteer for committee or other firm work
299500 newer associates have a very strong connection with each other as opposed to the institution if someone is treated badly they all react to it
299501 theyre saying ive looked at the world and theres no such thing as job security

299528 ive been able to do some very exciting things in the games business but nothing of this magnitude theoretically if anything happens to the human race it could be their dna that is used to resurrect humanity
299529 its a rollercoaster ride with apple always they make nice when they want me to come make a keynote there
299530 i dare say that in two to three years time we will see something using ray tracing from game developers
299531 sun executives have been in meetings with both douglas and schwartz to try and pin down exactly what the new business will do and how itll operate as theres no single clear definition of what
299532 no me duele nada no tengo ninguno de los s ntomas t picos que tiene una embarazada la estoy pasando b rbaro hasta ahora todo va re bien y tranquilo estamos chochos vamos a tener un var n

299534 n o posso me manifestar sobre a constitucionalidade ou n o de uma futura lei que reveja os benef cios da lei de anistia
299535 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
299536 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
299537 well see what the doctors have to say when they actually want him to go
299538 hes right on schedule in terms of practicing and running and when we want the live work in a game whether it will be preseason week three or week four well see
299539 thats probably the question i get the most from other riders is how do you ride
299540 she has to hold her line she cant cut across the track
299541 say theres something in the track she wants to move over she cant really move over if shes committed to that line
299542 the noise doesnt bother her so if youre behind her the pressures not there
299543 i dont feel it i dont hear it so it doesnt bother me
299544 i have to make sure shes not lying to me
299545 it was a mud race i didnt care i just wanted to ride i got fourth place out of 12 boys so it was really fun
299546 definitely in this sport you pretty much race against boys all the time
299547 once you get old enough at 12 years old you can ride with girls but i stayed in with boys as well i raced in the amateur national championship with boys
299548 i dont know if anything was really given to me i think i worked for it
299549 i think i just work hard and i practice a lot and i try to fix the things that are not right with my riding and keep making it better
299550 snowboarding is fun im not that good at that but i like it i like making videos with my friends texting
299551 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
299552 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
299553 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
299554 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
299555 i dont worry about him playing center field thats like riding a bike
299556 you know if this guy was out of baseball thats a bit different he was in the outfield for a long time hes obviously not going to be the same junior he was in the 90s but i dont think he should have any problems
299557 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
299558 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
299559 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
299560 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
299561 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
299562 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
299563 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
299564 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
299565 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
299566 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
299567 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
299568 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
299569 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
299570 i wasnt ready when i was here so i had to go down and get myself ready
299571 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
299572 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
299573 windows cannot find c windows system sass exe make sure you type the name correctly and then try again to search for a file click the start button and then click search

299577 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
299578 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
299579 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
299580 things like i have a horde and alliance character at maximum level or i have three max level characters
299581 for wow itll let us do a lot of really cool achievements and we can start doing those once achievements exist at the account level my system information

299585 you might enjoy this more than the beach if you arent that into beaches and are really into animals or whatever it is that we have

299589 what the hell happened to zooquarium this isnt what its normally like
299590 kids are sure to enjoy wearing their costumes to the zoo and getting some treats as well as a few tricks along the way
299591 pleased to be able to call on the city attorney and other city leaders to work with her in developing a blueprint for the city to ensure that when san francisco seeks much needed funding from outside sources there are clear guidelines for applying for and managing these resources
299592 the ultimate food and beverage festival all under one roof
299593 medical blogs have the opportunity to be such a benefit to patients
299594 by revealing the struggles we have they can really open patients eyes to how to interact with doctors they can connect patients and nurses who can be isolated from each other and they can be an important source of information for doctors as well as patients
299595 its time for us to take some responsibility and really think of how we can maintain the integrity of this process
299596 included sufficient information for patients to identify their doctors or themselves
299597 like everything else on the internet its just kind of the wild west
299598 its very leveling you can write in print what you would never say to a surgeons face about him being an overweening jerk
299599 it is semen you rocket scientist and we really really did not need to know that
299600 to hear about the effluent from your nether regions after your feelgood friday night
299601 it really gives a glimpse behind the medical curtain that otherwise the general public wouldnt see
299602 some of the opinions are very raw and in some cases dont reflect on the profession in a very positive way but they do reflect reality we often say what people dont like to hear
299603 its going to be a more high volume low margin business now
299604 the apps they have are richer they just dont have the publicity vehicle that google has
299605 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
299606 the race was so heavily covered we were very wrapped up in it here
299607 it seemed like a great publishing opportunity as they both have such incredible life stories and trajectories
299608 once we were off and running with the other books we got a lot of feedback internally
299609 people asked why arent we doing all three were giving them the same attention
299610 one day there was a girl who wanted to fly she dreamed of zooming in a spaceship up through clouds into outer space
299611 in her eight years in the white house she was a new kind of first lady blasting off like a rocket
299612 she flew into advancing the rights of women around the world always she was in the public with no privacy
299613 i was hoping shed win but i had finished the book before obama had that final string of victories
299614 obviously i have to break things down but i dont try to put spin in my books
299615 by the end of it i broke out in hives from head to toe
299616 barrys mind spun like a top how could he know which way to go listen said hope and he did
299617 one sunday when barack was sitting in church barack heard god say slow down look around you now look to me there is hope enough here to last a lifetime barack smiled tears rolling down his cheeks suddenly he knew for certain hope would last long enough for him to make a difference
299618 breathing in the scent of ginger blossoms barry grew swimming surfing and spearfishing next to playmates from places like portugal china india and japan
299619 a land of pet gibbons and pet crocodiles he caught crickets flew kites and joyed in the jungle at the edge of his new home a perfect paradise
299620 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
299621 doctors have told me i could drop dead at any moment
299622 i cant walk more than a few steps without getting out of breath and a few months ago i developed type 2 diabetes when i look in the mirror i feel sad and go to my bedroom and cry
299623 i know its partly my fault but its so hard to stop eating
299624 this makes bostock look like a jilted ex girlfriend trying to save her dignity in the face of a larger more formidable suitor and thats not a good sign for the company
299625 i applaud the decision to reject the offer because i see microsoft as an over the hill corporation destroying green octopus from redmond
299626 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honourable thing and step down from the board
299627 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose

299740 throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
299741 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
299742 i would be surprised if there was not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering plans are already afoot
299743 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court

299785 this island is a paradise it will always be a paradise but the people in paradise are scared
299786 crack cocaine is the number one substance of abuse for our antiguan clients followed by alcohol it was the influx of crack that caused members of the community to approach clapton in the first place and it is still very visible particularly in some parts of the island which is leading to crime
299787 and i have no idea how many guns are here crime is spiking all over the caribbean these homicides here with young people involved they are usually drug related
299788 guns are in the wrong hands and these people have become trigger happy
299789 and i am in favour of the death penalty crack five necks and i believe many more will get the message
299790 i was brought down here to build a police force and we are finding a lot of good officers people who are intelligent and who want to work hard
299791 but i fight with my fists these people have guns
299792 i dont even know who any of these people are

299794 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
299795 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
299796 the principle of resistance is a legitimate one however arms should not be in the hands of anyone
299797 the statement isnt inflammatory if anything its carefully calibrated to send a message to his followers as well as all iraqis that politically hes ready for elections if they occur and that hes reorganizing and strengthening his militia for what could be either a political or less pleasant struggle among the shiia factions
299798 we do have fallback plans if all of a sudden it deteriorates to the point where the health and safety of our athletes might be in jeopardy
299799 but i dont think that if the air quality was at that level that the ioc would even allow for the competition to take place
299800 we get tourists staring at it all the time and taking pictures
299801 its cool to see whats going on down at the beach inside hollister
299802 my thought was this gives us an opportunity to put more safety equipment on the beach
299803 we get a lot of money for the city two different benefits for the lifeguards there is the marketing value of surf city on all the monitors and it requires very little effort on our part

299806 if you aint being hated on then you aint doing shit
299807 i dont want to be a disruption to the team going in there
299808 i heard nick is a little out there something about some dirty 30 to dirty one so im going to stick with 17 and be happy with it
299809 francis went there with ears and eyes open and went to work give him some credit for a professional job
299810 three years in a row youve asked me that question
299811 a little bit i mean i thought if there was a year out of the three itd be this year
299812 he understands whats going on and the value i offer and what i do on the field and off the field
299813 he put everything into consideration and im still here for some reason with where theyre headed and how things are right now he feels that its better with me here as a player that could change tomorrow or it could change in a month or it could change next year
299814 i feel good my family is going to stay put for the next two months and i dont have to hear my kids ask daddy am i going to be traded anymore
299815 its just a matter of getting everything else in tune getting the timing and rhythm of my swing down things are working better lately and ive been getting some hits
299816 im fresher than id be playing every day in left field i can say that truthfully
299817 one thing weve seen is guys getting more accustomed to the dh role
299818 these guys are two way players but the bottom line is you need more production out of the dh and its good to see them swing the bats well
299819 i thought he was sharp funny knowledgeable not only about his football team but knowledgeable about our game players situations fundamentals
299820 he liked our young pitching and he said we play exciting baseball
299821 he wants to manage a couple of innings in a spring training game so maybe hes giving me a hint
299822 ill give him an open invitation to come out here and manage a few innings
299823 i was trying to do something different trying to get my confidence back
299824 but it never crossed my mind that i wanted to hit all right handed
299825 hes actually been swinging better i thought left handed a couple of times
299826 he can pitch more innings but i would not hesitate to use him against left handers
299827 our starting staff now is a legit staff even though they are young
299828 i would put them up with any of the staffs in the league even the veteran staffs just to see anibal come back last night and be back on track in just his first start to see how well he did against a good hitting team like colorado was a very good sign for us
299829 now weve got to go out and do it weve got confidence in everybody every night out we know we can get a quality start and shut a team down every night out
299830 not just the pitching a lot of things but pitching is what fell apart first now that we got everybody back everybody has a tremendous amount of confidence were hoping to feed off that
299831 right now everybody is together like we were in 06
299832 this year were back with a little more experience were healthy now which is whats important
299833 i was definitely pleased when i got here today to see my name in the lineup
299834 a day is good i feel fine sometimes a day helps
299835 if they had a righty going today i might have given him one more day
299836 a lot of times its just to give him that little break and match him up with a pitcher where he could really get back on track hes an all star hes a kid
299837 you have people that doubt you you have people that say you have a good year you got lucky for a year
299838 i was putting the ball in play but i just wasnt getting any results i was hitting it at guys or didnt have any luck going it was frustrating but i kept believing things were going to change
299839 im pretty close to 100 percent but its getting close
299840 getting hit in cincinnati didnt help but when i came off the dl i was still trying to get better
299841 i was shocked but there had been a lot of talk that i was going to be traded to a couple teams but i guess florida wanted me more
299842 its great to come over here on a winning team
299843 i think pinto likes to pitch and he may be a little upset
299844 now we have another guy in rhodes that can come in late in the game and pick up some innings for us
299845 a lot of young guys they want to go out there and win
299846 but im not going to change anything whatever theyve been doing from the beginning of the season they just need to keep it up
299847 i dont want to get suspended with the team playing good i want to help the team win
299848 ill just let commissioner bud selig do what hes gotta do
299849 it can be difficult deciding which way to go and this was something we put a lot of thought into
299850 we think we have a team thats capable of playing much better
299851 we had surges in may and early june we can get going like that again if we get everybody playing up to levels we feel theyre capable of playing we think we have a chance and so we decided we werent ready to give up on this season
299852 its been a lot better since the all star break
299853 im laying off bad pitches and showing better pitch selection
299854 well see how it goes with vazquez doing what hes doing
299855 travis will be in there against left handers and some right handers theres no plan ill just get him in there when i can
299856 i think its a great move on managements part not making any moves
299857 the most important ingredient is chemistry and thats what we have here
299858 but i didnt see that it would be a letdown here
299859 i mean all we were looking for was a right handed bat for right field and im looking at the production in right field right now and were looking at about 29 home runs a decent amount of rbis so i dont see that were losing that much for not getting jason bay versus what we would have had to give up
299860 but people are asking for david price what are you going to do
299861 and asking for jeremy hellickson who ive heard nothing but great things about theres only so much you can do when youre an organization that relies on your minor leagues to compete up here year to year
299862 we know that because weve seen it work weve seen it manifest out there on the field people are saying oh the rays didnt make a move were like great lets keep this going just the way it is
299863 its having someone who is so dear to us leave
299864 didnt bother me a smidge to start with i never really bought into it at all
299865 the one thing i do know is im happy to be a ray
299866 with these coaches this manager these people around here this town im just happy to be here thats for sure
299867 you know the old saying if its not broken dont fix it and i think the one reason we have so much success is it starts here in the clubhouse
299868 he said you see that flag up there thats why you cant wear 26 up here i wore 25 ever since then ive taken numbers in the 20s ive worn 25 28 in detroit and 20 in arizona
299869 there were a couple of guys who were hoping they had 24 so they could swap it out
299870 theres no telling what you could get ive seen guys given cash watches and motorcycles depends on how bad you want it
299871 you never know whats going to happen thats for sure
299872 im glad to see a lot of the guys and hopefully they are glad to see me
299873 my main focus is helping this team win and getting to the playoffs
299874 the way these things are right now it wouldnt have been smart for me to come back too early and be out for a month or longer
299875 from 25 30 yards he could put his passes wherever he wanted
299876 we had to work on the deep ball a little bit
299877 it started creeping into my long toss and creeping into my outings and thats when you arent helping
299878 you got to be professional when things arent there its important its important for your teammates to go out there with no excuses and i couldnt do that
299879 if i was able to help the club to get outs you dont say anything because you are the closer
299880 and you go every day because your team needs you to
299881 if i am getting people out i am not saying anything if i couldnt feel my arm anything
299882 ive gone through days where i had no business being out there but you get people out
299883 jones still has good stuff to get people out but being at about 70 percent and having to go out there makes that job very difficult to do
299884 ive been fighting it all year and finally im to the point now where im starting to feel good again it will happen for him too
299885 hopefully three four days after the dl stint is up
299886 we just got to wait and see how it goes but if i could recommend one thing its dont get old
299887 contrary to what everybody else thinks i still think i can come back and help this team
299888 i feel good now i know i have to focus on one thing and thats my rehab ill put everything into it and dedicate myself to getting back on the mound next season
299889 the surgery went well as good as could be expected if he gets after his rehab program he could be back in that time frame hes a valuable member of our club
299890 im not going to be able to do much for the first two or three months ill get together soon with the medical staff and start making a plan
299891 i think it could be earlier than nine to 12 months i have to be careful with a shoulder it takes time to heal but i have good work habits and thats going to help me i think i dont want to rush but i feel it can be earlier than a year it all depends on how my arm is going to respond to rehab
299892 john lackey jered weaver and jon garland theyve done a great job too
299893 im just thinking about my rehab well see where we are when that time comes
299894 once i get my health back i will be very happy to be back in the game its a game i love and i really miss being out there i really love this team and whatever they need me to do ill do it the team comes first
299895 i tell him to keep doing what hes doing and everything will work out i know its hard as a human being not knowing whats going to happen but hes going to be fine no matter what hes shown what hes capable of doing
299896 its just kind of a whirlwind i actually found out just as probably everyone else did a few minutes or half hour after the 4 oclock p m et deadline we were about ready to get on a bus and go to the airport and head to chicago and they called me back and told me youve been traded youre going to boston and good luck win a ring it was pretty exciting
299897 my name was everywhere and ultimately the deadline passed and it was like all that and then nothing then a half hour after the deadline they called and told me i had been traded
299898 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport that i didnt know
299899 it was very very overwhelming really its going to be something ill probably never forget thats for sure i cant wait everyone says the best fans in baseball are here and i cant wait to be a part of that
299900 for whatever reason my dad was a diehard red sox fan
299901 i had a onesie when i was however old and it was a red sox onesie and i still have it i grew up my entire life with two big posters one of jim rice and the other of carl yastrzemski with the new england i love you saying under it they are still in my parents basement
299902 they needed a left fielder im going to play left field and i cant wait
299903 hes going to be our left fielder and hes right handed and hes going to hit in the middle of our order but he doesnt have to be mannys replacement
299904 i dont think thats fair to put on any player were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a contributing member to a winning baseball team emphasis on the last word
299905 id been traded three times in the minor leagues before i got to pittsburgh albeit thats not the grand scale of this trade but i felt like i had been equipped somewhat to handle that i didnt know anything more than what everyone was writing i was following it just like everyone else was
299906 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to
299907 from what everyone says about boston and having played here a couple of years ago in interleague the atmosphere and obviously the winning i couldnt have hand picked a better place
299908 im not trying to dog it or anything but when you have an ultimate goal of being here and you feel like youre ready and youre there the whole time it grinds on you
299909 if i go out there and get hurt again i wont have any regrets
299910 we talked about needing the arm because we used brit last night and you dont want to fry your bullpen
299911 but brians time was almost up and he was so good for us before he got hurt and we want him back
299912 his stuff was very good his slider was outstanding his changeup was good
299913 and he was throwing hard so he was a big part of our bullpen before that dreaded day in chicago
299914 i want to see him here in this setting as opposed to pitching down there
299915 sometimes the setting heres a little bit different and im anxious to see if we can get him back to where he was
299916 you got six hours to live and for those remaining six hours you can listen to dylan or neil young
299917 does anyone want an irish car bomb i got one to give away
299918 youve got a choice between starving to death or eating to death
299919 if i were to kill a man itd be with a pool cue
299920 theres a difference between being funny and being an asshole
299921 you know the last time someone said that to me i ended up with an engagement ring on my finger
299922 youre a pretty nice guy and i love you but you are kind of an asshole sometimes
299923 the shark started blinking the road was the utterly desolate and hot stretch between clarkston wash and enterprise ore we were descending into a several thousand foot canyon when the idiot light started making its clicking noise thirty miles from a town of any appreciable size

299933 the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck

299936 after almost two years of hand wringing had passed an expert hired by regulators declared that neil suffered from an ethical disability and he was required to pay a 50 000 fine for his ethical lapses at silverado
299937 while five other silverado directors were barred from working for any federally insured institution for life neil was only ordered to
299938 another interesting aside to the story is how the public closure of silverado was delayed until after the 1988 election
299939 so the question remains how did neil manage to stay out of jail after regulators determined that his conduct involved significant conflicts of interest and constituted multiple breaches of his fiduciary duties the answer to that question involves a story within a story and one cover up covered up by a second

299945 remains one of the great unresolved questions of the olympic movement
299946 ask anyone in the world who watches the games on television if they know what an olympian is and theyll all nod their heads
299947 from their perspective its very simple but from the olympians perspective its very complex
299948 its the intrinsic fact that youre part of a fraternity and everyone else wants to be part of that exclusive fraternity
299949 its as if you went to vietnam in the first marine division and kicked butt
299950 you can sum it up by saying that the term olympian is loosely used and that there is no definition for olympian
299951 there is no definition of olympian because the only organization that can officially do it is the ioc and theyve kept it vague
299952 each of them have a clear definition of who is a participating athlete
299953 as an example in football all 18 athletes who have been entered as part of the team are awarded a medal
299954 an olympian is an athlete who has been accredited to participate in the olympic games in a full medal sport
299955 it is not a small incremental step this is a whole other ballgame with this radar
299956 it is just a much more lethal and much more survivable platform
299957 it s the only place where they found it and they ripped it up immediately
299958 we took this prudent action out of an abundance of caution and our commitment to public safety even though there is no evidence from the child development center that there is an acute health risk related to play on this type of artificial surface

299964 in that six months i will not sleep easily on the weekends until i get up in the morning and look at the blotter reports and see ok are my troops doing as i expect them to do out there or not
299965 maybe a few soldiers will misbehave but it wont be serious i think most of them know how to control themselves
299966 this is great news for us it should have been eased far earlier
299967 del icio us is most powerful because the content that is being tagged and stored is stuff that individuals have chosen and flagged a real human being so when i am looking to do market research on something like email open rates in the united states and i see a report website web page or article that someone has tagged my feeling is that it must be of value one of my favorite features of del icio us is that for each item you can see how many people have tagged that specific piece of content that is respect respect is a huge factor in deciding what content lives or dies to the individual are you listening marketers knowing that a group of people have identified the same piece and tagged it for themselves is a completely different search spirit
299968 weve seen a zillion different confusions and misspellings of del icio us over the years for example de licio us del icio us com and del licio us so moving to delicious com will make it easier for people to find the site and share it with their friends of course the old del icio us domain and all its urls will continue to work also note that the domain change requires a new login cookie which is why everyone has to log in again it has taken us a while to get here and we really appreciate all the patience and support youve shown us now that our new platform is in place we expect to release new features more quickly please check out the new site and then head over to our new discussion forum to let us know what you think and what youd like to see next well be listening
