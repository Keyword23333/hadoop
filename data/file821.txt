8210024 typically online communities are criticized for promoting disembodied and immaterial connections too often political campaigns that may once have mobilized a street action or something directly physical have instead turned into a cascade of emails and online petitions but as the remarkable participation in the february 2003 global anti war demonstrations revealed the same electronic communities can network themselves to produce an unprecedented public demonstration

8210047 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8210048 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8210049 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8210050 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8210051 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8210052 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8210053 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8210054 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8210055 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8210056 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8210057 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen

8210065 we are serious about everybody we consider and i think ty is a consideration
8210066 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see

8210215 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church on abortion
8210216 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8210217 while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8210218 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with the respect for the fundamental right to life
8210219 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8210220 this isnt about abortion on demand its about careful careful consideration of all factors that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
8210221 and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins as i say the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this
8210222 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8210223 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the first moment of conception to natural death
8210224 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8210225 in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled
8210226 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8210227 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8210228 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8210229 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any kind

8210274 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history they look at themselves they are unreliable but not all of them
8210275 the mdc does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8210276 i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8210277 we have a pact with the people were the popular chants

8210281 i wondered if maybe you were married i didnt see a mom
8210282 why dont you call that morning and well make definite plans
8210283 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8210284 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8210285 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8210286 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single vision
8210287 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8210288 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8210289 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8210290 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8210291 shes done all she has to do it had to take so much for her
8210292 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8210293 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8210296 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is that its great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8210297 when he was left out he didnt open his mouth or anything he just went back to the drawing board at sussex and has done a fantastic job there
8210298 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8210299 we came off such a high in the test series some of the best moments in my career and this is right down there in terms of the lowest
8210300 we have to regroup pretty quickly take this blow on the chin come back from it and play our kind of cricket your confidence can take a big dent when you lose like this
8210301 its reaching the point right now for me i probably shouldnt have played in this game where we look to the medical team and see if we can come up with something
8210302 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8210303 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament
8210304 i need managers i want workers people who take people to work i do not want people with own businesses i want one business the peoples business

8210307 bbc programme makers and reporters decide what and how stories are reported there is absolutely no truth in any implication that the bbc compromised editorial independence
8210308 the programme was commissioned a long time ago we would not be in the position of having our editorial decisions prompted by people outside the organisation
8210309 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8210310 said imam also known as dr fadl is seen as the godfather of jihadi thought leadership drew on his edicts for years but last november he published a devastating treatise that drew on islamic law and jurisprudence to argue that resorting to violence is banned and so was rebelling against a muslim ruler he writes to young muslims urging them to turn away from recruiters

8210317 hes not really on the music scene right now just that hes not performing

8210320 the world has changed and we cannot remain indifferent to the changes in colombia
8210321 ten or 15 years ago the people applauded the armed struggle in colombia now they reject it
8210322 we are tired on the war and we have been under pressure from the army the farc and the eln
8210323 it was pointless to see our people continuing to die
8210324 when i joined you could move around quite freely in and out of villages now the army is all around and the local population are afraid to help us there was no future for us
8210325 this is a model that we can use against isolated farc and eln units
8210326 now the local guerrilla commanders have little contact with the high command and in some cases feel abandoned they can surrender and get government benefits or be killed in military operations
8210327 so theyre seeing the rich customers slow down in payments slow down in purchases
8210328 but i pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing and incidentally it will get cured at some time in the future but right now the situation is getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
8210329 i dont think the intrinsic business value shrunk in fact i said i thought it probably increased a touch

8210339 when there is more carbon dioxide the temperature gets warmer
8210340 each of the six seminars will raise a different commonly asked question about climate change and its our job as scientists to provide the answers
8210341 this first session will look at the most basic of questions which seems to be a major sticking point for some how can the earth really be warming
8210342 remarks such as this get in the way of climate action as they call into question whether theres a problem to address
8210343 the fact that some people are asking these questions means that we as scientists have a responsibility to explain the science behind climate change
8210344 members of the public will also get to ask questions at the end of each seminar

8210352 the biggest problem were facing right now is defining mccain
8210353 my biggest question is who is going to take on mccain
8210354 barack is never going to be a red meat attack dog politician
8210355 the thing that matters most is what the candidate says
8210356 theres a disparity between the reality of john mccain and the way hes perceived
8210357 i think joe biden will go toe to toe with mccain they picked him for that
8210358 the clinical team dr z and r have expressed their views and to be fair to them dr z has perhaps a more stronger way presented concerns about delusional disorder
8210359 i have given a commitment to people in the 9 11 truth movement to continue requesting an apology until i have been given one
8210360 if i have not received an apology by august the 30th instead of protesting in auckland as i did last year i will be protesting outside whangarei base hospital
8210361 dr zubaran has perhaps in a more stronger way presented concerns about a delusional disorder he accepts that that is circumscribed and limited to specific issues of american policy

8210363 similar re emergence of the disease in the uk would also not be unexpected in the coming weeks

8210369 once i realized she was attempting to get me to give her my camera i became confused and told her i would not give it to her
8210370 i had not committed any crime and had been sitting peacefully just like many others around me
8210371 i found this to be absurd since there were no benches around and there were many other people sitting around the square
8210372 the ledge and the area around the ledge where i was sitting is styled in such a way that it appears to have been intended to be used as a seating area in addition to any other apparent purpose it may have

8210375 a successful public space develops conviviality use social interaction and obviously sitting around is basic
8210376 trying to eliminate that from a public space is completely opposite to its whole intention
8210377 i had just picked up chloe from nursery we were both hungry so i got us a sausage roll to share i had a bite and then bent down to give a bit to chloe who was on her bike
8210378 a tiny bit missed her mouth and fell on the floor and seconds later some pigeons flew down and grabbed it i crossed the road and was approached by two men at first i thought they were canvassers as they were dressed in tracksuit bottoms
8210379 but one came up to me said he was from the council and said i was going to be fined for dropping litter
8210380 i felt really small and humiliated i was treated like i was a criminal where is the common sense it was a small bite sized piece just big enough for her mouth
8210381 i went back to take a picture of the litter but it had been gobbled by pigeons there was no litter there at all
8210382 the issuing of the fixed penalty notice is the result of the mothers actions and not as a result of childs
8210383 its fairly common language these days to express sadness anger or hurt
8210384 its a degrading word to use and jesus is anything but that its like calling white black
8210385 when someone comes to the point of saying jesus is the devil or jesus is expletive the bible does say be very careful because youre on thin ice
8210386 one of the great problems with our country is that we talk about rights such as privacy and freedom of speech and the like but they are not enshrined or protected in any way as they are in america
8210387 while there are always limits on freedom of speech you cant incite violence or anything like that it seems to be now more than ever that our rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression should be protected
8210388 a bill of rights which enshrines that protection is long overdue in this country
8210389 a shirt might offend some and might be amusing to others
8210390 if a person was wearing the shirt in a church or a religious rally where it was specifically intended to offend or cause disruption then perhaps the prosecution might stand a chance re lick the jack boots reports and stories of outrageous control policy
8210391 if there are pervs or oglers theyd be hurried on by the lifeguards it is an open area it is not as if there are dirty old men in raincoats hiding behind phone boxes

8210394 racist incidents among children in early years settings tend to be around name calling casual thoughtless comments and peer group relationships
8210395 react negatively to a culinary tradition other than their own by saying yuk
8210396 no racist incident should be ignored when there is a clear racist incident it is necessary to be specific in condemning the action
8210397 reveal negative attitudes the lack of censure may indicate to the child that there is nothing unacceptable about such attitudes
8210398 some people think that if a large number of racist incidents are reported this will reflect badly on the institution in fact the opposite is the case
8210399 to make passes on women and disturb families he said
8210400 to stop selling cats and dogs re lick the jack boots reports and stories of outrageous control policy

8210403 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour

8210439 nevadas been pretty divided so for that to be achieved is significant
8210440 my sense being on this floor is of the energy in this room the enthusiasm of people willing to work together as one party to elect barack obama and defeat john mccain
8210441 the message is going to be they came together they unified the party and theyre moving toward november strong
8210442 he has to reach out to the former hillary supporters who are still on the fence and i do not believe they will be when this is over

8210450 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8210451 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8210452 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8210453 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8210454 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8210455 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8210456 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8210457 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8210462 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them he said requesting anonymity
8210463 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport foreign ministry spokesman ali al sadiq said
8210464 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdel wahid were not expecting him to say yes sadiq said
8210465 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris kufra airport director khaled saseya told libyas official jana news agency
8210466 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation he said in a telephone interview on al jazeera television

8210470 what i do in my home is my business because its my liberty
8210471 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8210472 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8210473 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8210474 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8210475 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8210476 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8210477 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8210478 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8210479 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8210480 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8210481 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8210482 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8210483 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8210484 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8210485 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8210486 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8210487 finally we are starting to see the political will that is so desperately needed to save our storm boy country senator hanson young said
8210488 today we moved from talk to action to save a national icon and help australians in need

8210523 council believes its made the right decision on those grounds for the specific site
8210524 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8210525 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8210526 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8210527 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8210528 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8210529 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8210530 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8210538 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8210539 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan

8210543 we are pleased to have ed join our team to forge lasting relationships with our strategic channel partners and resellers
8210544 we faced a complex challenge to deliver rich content superior functionality and better performance from the data warehouse it had been our single biggest ongoing it challenge for several years against a backdrop of budget pressures the business was demanding better data more regularly wanting to switch from monthly to daily reports

8210546 ich bin eine stolze demokratin eine stolze amerikanerin und eine stolze unterst tzerin von barack obama
8210547 barack obama ist mein kandidat und er muss unser pr sident werden
8210548 das sind die gr nde warum ich um die pr sidentschaft gek mpft habe und das sind die gr nde warum ich barack unterst tze
8210549 ich m chte dass ihr euch selbst fragt habt ihr euch nur meinetwegen im wahlkampf engagiert
8210550 es ist nicht clintons aufgabe mich zu berzeugen obama zu w hlen das muss obama schon selbst tun
8210551 weil er beim ac mailand wie ein prinz behandelt wurde in chelsea hatten wir aber eine andere philosophie wir hatten keine prinzen
8210552 ich hoffe dass er den erfolg mit inter hat den er bisher auch anderswo hatte er ist ein trainer der wei was er will
8210553 ich hatte nie ein pers nliches problem mit andrej ich glaube dass er in zukunft wieder ein spieler von gro er qualit t sein wird

8210557 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8210558 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8210559 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8210560 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8210561 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8210562 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8210563 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8210564 who are open to doing something on the production side
8210565 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8210566 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8210567 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8210568 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8210569 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8210570 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8210571 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8210572 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8210573 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8210574 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8210575 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8210576 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8210577 de britse huizenmarkt blijft heel uitdagend en we verwachten op korte termijn geen herstel
8210578 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8210579 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8210580 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8210581 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8210582 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8210583 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8210584 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8210585 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8210586 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8210587 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8210588 quon soit fran ais ou non on touche des allocations familiales partir de 2 enfants m me les personnes les plus riches en france re oivent les allocations familiales
8210589 pour les trangers il faut remplir deux conditions r sider l galement sur le territoire fran ais avec un titre de s jour et avoir une r sidence effective stable le bail faisant souvent offfice de preuve
8210590 non pour les personnes trang res il faut absolument constituer un dossier de demande sans ce dossier pas dallocations car la caf ne conna t pas les trangers ensuite pour un enfant n en france il faut envoyer un extrait dacte de naissance pour les autres un certificat m dical
8210591 si elles sont vers es oui pour 4 enfants le montant mensuel des allocations est de 428 61 euros au del de 4 enfants il faut ajouter 154 15 euros par enfant suppl mentaire dans le cas qui nous occupe le montant global des allocations seraient de 736 91 euros par mois
8210592 cette allocation regroupe 4 petites allocations les deux premi res sont vers es sous conditions de ressources donc angelina jolie et brad pitt nont pu avoir ces deux sommes l lallocation de base pour assurer les d penses pendant les 3 premi res ann es de la vie de lenfant cela quivaut 172 77 euros par mois cest la somme vers e qui varie de 135 euros 536 euros par mois pendant le cong parental mais pour la recevoir il faut avoir travaill suffisament longtemps en france 4 le compl ment du libre choix du mode de garde si les parents choisissent une assistante maternelle agr e en france d clar e lurssaf ils peuvent avoir 162 20 euros multipli par le nombre denfants qui vont chez lassistante si celle ci vient garder les enfants la maison cest 162 20 pour tous les enfants cette allocation ne fonctionne pas pour une nounou am ricaine
8210593 oui mais a ne me semble pas tr s probable et si tel est le cas ils toucheraient entre 162 20 euros sils font garder leur enfant chez eux et 973 20 euros sils font garder tous leurs enfants chez une assistante maternelle agr e

8210603 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8210604 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8210605 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8210606 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8210607 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8210608 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8210614 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8210615 those are the reasons i ran for president these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too

8210617 we dont need four more years of the last eight years

8210630 ich freue mich sehr ber das vertrauen das mir die bags mitgliedsorganisationen entgegen gebracht haben als vorsitzender der bags sehe ich es als meine aufgabe die akzeptanz des bags kollektivvertrages bei den f rdergebern und f rdergeberinnen zu erh hen und diesen kollektivvertrag als leitkollektivvertrag im gesundheits und sozialbereich zu etablieren gleichzeitig ist es mein ziel dass die bags noch st rker als interessenvertretung der arbeitgeber und arbeitgeberinnen auftritt
8210631 es sind vor allem die vp gemeinden die sich dem ausbau der krabbelstuben in den weg stellen
8210632 und es sind die vp landesregierungsmitglieder die gedeckt durch die gr nen den bedarf an diesen einrichtungen negieren
8210633 wenn werner faymann sagt ober sterreich habe bei der kinderbetreuung f r unter dreij hrige noch geh rigen aufholbedarf und die gr nen sollten ihrem landesregierungspartner in dieser frage mehr auf die finger schauen so hat er damit v llig recht
8210634 dem zust ndigen landesrat ackerl ist diese tatsache seit langem bekannt und er gibt auch sein bestes daran etwas zu ndern er scheitert aber stets an vp gef hrten gemeinden
8210635 dass sich aber gerade der kindergarten landesrat sigl jetzt auf diese aussagen faymanns st rzt und sie landesrat ackerl zur last legen will setzt der unverfrorenheit der vp die krone auf
8210636 gerade sigl war es n mlich der bei den gespr chen ber die 15a vereinbarung mit dem bund durch die mehr mittel f r den ausbau der kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen von bund und land zur verf gung gestellt werden sollten meinte es br uchte gar nicht so viel f r die unter dreij hrigen
8210637 die gr nen sind also sehr wohl aufgefordert sich hier die tatsachen genau anzusehen und mit ihrem koalitionspartner hier einmal etwas h rter ins gericht zu gehen
8210638 vielleicht hilft das landesrat ackerl den von ihm geplanten ausbau fl chendeckend auch in vp gemeinden umzusetzen

8210651 w hlen mit 16 ist ein signal an die jugend dass sie von der politik ernst genommen wird das demokratische recht zur stimmabgabe soll sie darin best rken
8210652 junge menschen treffen ihre wahlentscheidung nach eigenen gesichtspunkten sie orientieren sich st rker als erwachsene an sachthemen
8210653 die nicht nur fragen stellen sondern selbst vorschl ge unterbreiten
8210654 mein zentrales verst ndnis von jugendpolitik war immer diese nicht nur f r sondern gemeinsam mit den jungen menschen zu gestalten
8210655 deshalb auch mein pers nlicher aufruf an die etwa 200 000 erstmals wahlberechtigten jungen menschen am 28 september seid ihr gefragt nutzt euer demokratisches recht zur stimmabgabe eure stimme z hlt
8210656 diese zwischenbilanz ist vor allem auf die ausgezeichneten rahmenbedingungen und auf die wettbewerbsf higkeit der heimischen tourismuswirtschaft zur ckzuf hren
8210657 unsere branche ist gut ger stet qualit t und leistung stimmen in sterreich 20 millionen g ste in den ersten sieben monaten dieses jahres sind eindrucksvoller beweis daf r

8210659 es ist wichtig derartige studien ernst zu nehmen und sich gewissenhaft mit den ergebnissen auseinander zu setzen was aber definitiv nicht gemacht werden darf ist daraus eine pauschalverurteilung unserer jugendlichen abzuleiten
8210660 hier wird in manchen medien nicht erst jetzt sondern schon seit geraumer zeit ein bild von unserer jugend gezeichnet das mit der realit t nicht bereinstimmt als jugendministerin stelle ich mich klar gegen derartige verallgemeinerungen
8210661 das projekt setzt also genau dort an n mlich im lebensraum schule wo kinder wirksam f r das thema gesundheit gesunde ern hrung und bewegung sensibilisiert und auch begeistert werden k nnen

8210663 universit ten durch refundierung der studienbeitr ge wieder am g ngelband der regierung
8210664 die finanzielle unterst tzung der universit ten darf nicht vor dem populismus altar geopfert werden
8210665 alleine der b rokratische aufwand der aktion kostet viel unn tiges geld au erdem widerspricht die finanzierung durch den bund dem universit tsgesetz das den hochschulen mehr autonomie vor allem auch bei der finanzierung gew hrt
8210666 die ansage dass es zu umstrukturierungen kommen kann verhindert jede budget re planungssicherheit
8210667 die kosten f r die wahlzuckerln zahlen wir die jungen
8210668 auch wenn viele einem potenziellen sp antrag zustimmen wir erwarten von den konstruktiven kr ften weiterhin zu ihrem wort zu stehen und gegen die abschaffung der beitr ge aufzutreten
8210669 we are in big trouble this time god is missing and they think we did it
8210670 die 2004 beschlossene bergangsbestimmung zum schutz des heimischen arbeitsmarkts bis 1 1 2011 sch tzt nicht mehr sondern schadet der wirtschaft
8210671 f r viele war es berraschend f r uns aber nicht ber ein drittel der ausgestellten bewilligungen in der fachkr fteverordnung wurden f r k che aus eu beitrittsl ndern ausgestellt
8210672 die tourismuswirtschaft kann nicht mehr warten wir brauchen die sofortige ffnung des arbeitsmarktes berall in europa d rfen die b rger aus den eu beitrittsl ndern arbeiten au er in sterreich und in deutschland das versteht keiner mehr weder hier noch dort
8210673 das saisonierkontingent muss trotzdem erhalten bleiben weil haupts chlich arbeitskr fte aus drittstaaten wie zum beispiel serbien und bosnien davon betroffen sind der tourismus ist ein saisongesch ft und f r die spitzen in der saison werden diese arbeitskr fte auch weiterhin ben tigt
8210674 der reiseverkehr hat auch 2007 ber 6 mrd euro zum leistungsbilanz berschuss von 8 mrd euro erwirtschaftet und mit fast 200 000 mitarbeitern haben wir im juli 2008 einen besch ftigungsrekord im hotel und gastgewerbe wer das nicht erkennt schadet der tourismuswirtschaft wir erwarten eine rasche positive antwort seitens der politik
8210675 speziell nach der senkung des aktiven wahlalters auf 16 jahre ist es wichtig politische bildung in sterreichs schulen zu intensivieren und zu verbessern mit diesem schuljahr werden durch die initiative der bundesregierung und insbesondere in kooperation mit bundesminister johannes hahn wichtige schritte f r mehr und bessere politische bildung an unseren schulen gesetzt

8210685 my son called me to tell me there were eight dead piglets in the farrowing hut which is like a maternity unit for pigs
8210686 at first i couldnt understand why so many were dead so my first thought was that it could be foot and mouth
8210687 a similar thing happened on the same piece of land last year
8210688 on that occasion someone shot the front window of a tractor and completely blew out the rear window
8210689 it just makes you wonder why these people cant just leave things alone
8210690 its not the cost of replacing the piglets that worries me in some respect they are irreplaceable because they are already part of the production of the farm

8210709 the role of the board of directors in corporate social responsibility
8210710 long term investors are realizing that how the firm manages its social and environmental impacts and responds to social and environmental trends can affect long term firm performance
8210711 as i show in my study increasingly boards of directors are starting to integrate social and environmental considerations csr into their strategy and risk management csr is moving into the boardroom with the growing realization of the business case for csr once csr moves into the boardroom it becomes a factor in board governance
8210712 analysts thought leaders and board directors themselves perceive a definite albeit modest trend toward greater integration of csr considerations into business strategy and boardrooms
8210713 increasingly directors are coming to understand the csr business case there is a growing awareness that pro active management of a firms social and environmental risks and opportunities can result in sustainable value creation
8210714 the role of the chair is key to setting the tone and creating a culture of openness amongst the board of directors to facilitate consideration of csr issues
8210715 group think can often get in the way of csr consideration
8210716 stakeholders seeking to affect a firms approach to csr increasingly come to understand that boards of directors set the tone at the top and are responsible for the overall direction of the firm in that they have oversight over the firms values and sustainability performance the ceos incentive program and the firms business strategy
8210717 for successful management of a firms sustainability performance the board needs to demonstrate its commitment and oversight of csr
8210718 these are key to successful csr integration and embedment the board must show its active ownership of this issue and its awareness of its role in the absence of which a firms commitment to effective social and environmental performance management could be suspect

8210736 i ragazzi pensavano solo alla partita contro il galatasaray dobbiamo capire che non possiamo trattare due partite in modo diverso siamo professionisti e dobbiamo considerare tutte le partite a pari livello chi gioca nella steaua deve confermarsi ogni volta che viene chiamato in causa
8210737 giocheremo una partita diversa spiega lex allenatore del bayer 04 leverkusen la squadra si sta cementando e alcuni giocatori hanno recuperato dai rispettivi infortuni tra questi harry kewell
8210738 siamo assolutamente concentrati sulla partita e sappiamo quanto sia importante la gara di ritorno
8210739 the ground has dried up nicely and they are ready to roll
8210740 i know the problems and i know they wont go away its not my problem and not my decision
8210741 those problems are now behind me and i think you can see the new manager having the same problems as i did
8210742 i dont take pleasure in seeing england struggle ive documented the problems before and if you have an hour i could document them again

8210746 youll see a number of cases where players win multiple times on the same course and id love to do it again at the tpc boston
8210747 i love the way the greens are designed the way the rough is cut so you can actually play shots

8210755 the fact is that the banks are making enormous profits at the expense of card holders they are well able to charge and to take their commission they dont hesitate to levy huge interest rates whenever anyone fails to make a payment
8210756 we were told that chip and pin was the most secure system but it now appears that it is just as likely to be open to fraud most people are now entirely dependent on the banks as their wages or social welfare payments go directly into their account this places a huge responsibility on banks when they were investing in the chip and pin system they should have taken greater steps to make it secure
8210757 there is a certain onus on card holders themselves not to disclose their details the message is that fraudsters are out there and coming up with more and more sophisticated scams all the time

8210759 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8210760 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8210761 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8210762 we need to do prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base
8210763 this second collection of stories from the pen of the imaginative author of the eye and the finger the web of easter island and poems for midnight offers a striking variety the tales in strange harvest range from fantasy through the macabre to outstanding science fiction here are such remarkable stories as nightmare with its baffling dream imagery the grimly sardonic atom smasher the account of eerie new growth that animates spawn of the sea the narrative of the bizarre plague of the shisperers and the tale of the voyagers from depths of space in something from above these and many more furnish a feast for the most avid devotees of imaginative fiction at its sometimes chilling but always evocative best provided by one of its foremost practitioners

8210820 the figure of collected bras has not changed much over the last few weeks as people are on holidays
8210821 so we are going to do a blitz we are appealing to all ica groups there are 29 guilds in county laois and they are all going to support us from mid september so hopefully we will get all the counties to follow suit
8210822 there will be bras hung around the centre of the mall and mayo cancer support will have a stall with information and well be collecting bras for anyone that wants to get rid of them
8210823 were also appealing to all the secondary schools nationwide to collect bras there are 150 000 girls attending secondary schools in ireland and if each one brought in a bra we would definitely make our target so fingers crossed

8210826 its been a really easy transition to come over here
8210827 i think it would have been really hard if id come over halfway through a season the decision to come over early was a really good one
8210828 the whole setup is new to me and thats something that is really exciting to be able to come here and play in different styles of competition
8210829 i think thats an expectation we should put on ourselves and something that we should not shy away from
8210830 weve got to set some high goals and i think a top four finish is something very doable for us
8210831 we have an exciting young team and a team that has now been together for a while this is something that im really excited about and something that the fans and the club as a whole should really look forward to
8210832 hes an exciting player im sure hell have a lot of tests under his belt when he finishes his career
8210833 i think the combination that we can form if we can get going really quickly and early in the season can set our backline alight weve got a lot of pace out wide and guys that can finish from anywhere
8210834 id played in six or seven super 14s it was good to come over here and have a chance to play in the heineken cup
8210835 its exciting you get big crowds its a big occasion on a big stage and its a challenge im really looking forward to
8210836 i dont look back with any regrets i did what i could and im very proud of what i achieved in the all black jersey

8210841 i welcome the relatives of the pitmen who died in the maypole mining disaster 100 years ago
8210842 the facts you all know well but of the afternoon shift of 78 men and boys only three made it to safety the scale of the tragedy was unprecedented and even in todays modern world where there are often huge fatalities the event stands out
8210843 in my own county of mayo the news was received with dismay and the 13 mayo men who perished left behind huge extended families
8210844 the explosion caused many women to become instant widows and left numerous children without loving fathers the same was true for all the extended families in wigan who also felt the same loss
8210845 the maypole mining disaster evokes memories of a time when mining was a huge industry
8210846 i congratulate the committee for organising the remembrance march from the pithead to the historic st john the evangelist church by walking in the footsteps of those who perished we cannot but be reminded of that awful day

8210850 nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the governments strategy for the transfer of assets to the private sector as set out in the strategy document supplied by the treasurer is not appropriate for maximising financial value for taxpayers
8210851 i am not commenting on the merits of transferring electricity assets to the private sector my role is to review the strategy document that has been developed to give effect to any such transfer

8210859 biden conveys this sense that we need to use all the elements of national power
8210860 in the 21st century the threats we face are at least as dangerous and in some ways more complex than those weve confronted in the past
8210861 by definition they require cooperative solutions while working with our allies and coming together in effective partnerships
8210862 we know how to do this better than the administration and we certainly know how to do it better than
8210863 hes acting like a commander in chief by responding in a balanced way and adjusting as the situation moves along
8210864 sen mccain doesnt help the situation by blustering a lot at the russians without useful steps to take and second by politicizing the issue
8210865 the basic idea is that you have to take national security head on as a democrat because youve got three decades of skepticism of democrats on national security dating back to vietnam
8210866 theres a real problem that has to be addressed but theres also a real opportunity because people have become so disillusioned with the republican approach to security
8210867 the mistake that the kerry campaign made was to assume that his heroism in vietnam and surrounding himself with military brass would be enough
8210868 what they failed to recognize was that republicans will attack any democrat as weak on defense regardless of the facts
8210869 no longer is national security the separate discrete issue it once was
8210870 you need to connect it to the strength of the economy the strength of morale at home and many other issues
8210871 in 2004 they tried a very old fashioned security message and people in america could see their hearts werent in it
8210872 we need a whole new way of looking at it
8210873 its a hard message to convey and i dont think hes succeeded yet but if we can convey that theres a better way to do that americans will believe us
8210874 the whole theme of the platform and the whole message of sen obamas campaign is renewal is looking forward
8210875 it does not assume that we can tackle 21st century challenges with 20th century tools or frames
8210876 to empower the forces of moderation america must live up to our values respect civil liberties reject torture and lead by example
8210877 by going the extra diplomatic mile while keeping all options on the table we make it more likely that the rest of the world will stand with us to increase pressure on iran if diplomacy is failing
8210878 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
8210879 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
8210880 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
8210881 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

8211132 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8211133 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8211134 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8211182 this is our 10th year doing this and its a pleasure
8211183 these guys deserve every bit of what we did today some of them have really been through it
8211184 they truly enjoy getting out its a way to break up the monotony of being at chillicothe
8211185 they must have said thank you 25 times coming down the ramp
8211186 they were all very thankful it does something for you to see them so happy as a group we look very forward to this

8211188 it also gives you a good feeling to repay these guys for the time they spent in service to our country
8211189 out of 30 indicators we went from 25 to 26 which is an improvement in our indicators which were very happy about you have to have 29 out of 30 to be ranked excellent unless you show significant improvement in value added and thats what happened in our case
8211190 from looking at our report card it looks like we need to work on our science and social studies which are not just one grade level indicator its across the levels and were going to continue to work on our assessments and curriculum maps and look at best practices as well
8211191 we are happy with our results because its not easy the teachers have to work extremely hard to get the scores we have
8211192 some people may look at our scores and think well theyre very similar to last year but that doesnt come without a lot of work
8211193 were not happy with our indicators but it looked like the problem child for a lot of districts was having trouble with fifth grade scores
8211194 twenty five indicators is low for us but i think weve identified the areas that need work
8211195 we were effective again and the middle school and elementary school met ayp adequate yearly progress which was really big for us
8211196 this is the first year the high school didnt make ayp and we just missed it in one area and weve got to correct that
8211197 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8211198 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8211199 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8211200 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8211201 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8211202 west virginians value hard work patriotism and faith in god they mine the coal make the steel and work the assembly lines that make our industries tick their experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life they can shake your hand look you in the eye and touch your heart
8211203 and let me tell you something they cant afford four more years like the last eight they need and deserve better from washington
8211204 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8211205 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8211206 while the changes are not complete they are indeed significant
8211207 this city took this on unlike anywhere else in america and has made great great progress
8211208 the distance from home is not too close and not too far

8211210 with the 90 plus groups on campus and greek life youll never be bored get involved
8211211 you are the face of this campus and will shape what the next four years will look like

8211214 try new things expand yourself and expose yourself to new experiences
8211215 i cant stress enough the value of an education specifically a liberal arts degree
8211216 its the first time ive actually been sad about leaving
8211217 im going to miss my friends being on campus and the people just the atmosphere its a lot different from being back home which is where im going
8211218 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8211219 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8211220 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8211221 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8211222 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8211223 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8211224 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8211225 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8211226 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8211227 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8211228 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8211229 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8211230 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8211231 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8211232 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8211233 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8211234 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8211235 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8211238 while we remain confident about the fundamental strength of the groups operations its market position and its competitiveness the continuing difficult trading conditions in the us and the sharp downturn in the uk makes the short to medium term outlook uncertain and the group expects a further period of challenging operating conditions

8211462 elano has great mobility and the ability and willingness to receive the ball in tight positions makes him a dangerous proposition i sensed he would cause west ham problems in that role and i know that it is one that he likes
8211463 he has played slightly deeper in a number of games last season but he likes that no 10 role and it is made to measure for him he enjoys being pushed further forward
8211464 we will see what shape he is in but i think we can tap into the high that he is on after he finished the olympic tournament on a great note winning a medal and scoring twice
8211465 we are well positioned to deliver the growth and cost reductions outlined in our strategic plan to fy2015

8211489 im shocked maybe because john mccain continues to believe that president bushes policies are great for the ecomony gt
8211490 many of john mccains top advisors worked as lobbyist with the oil and gas companies i guess that explains why he wants to give another billion dollar tax break to oil companies
8211491 this initiative is a civil society driven platform for change
8211492 the need for a practical achievable vision of a safe south africa has arrived and no more can citizens continue doing the same things while hoping for different outcomes
8211493 top creative thinkers strategists and business leaders action for a safe south africa has realised that they are not talking about business as usual with a bit added on
8211494 it is obvious that to achieve the best outcome we must engage not only specialists in crime and violence prevention and criminal justice
8211495 we need big innovative ideas and clever strategies to fund and implement these ideas capacity commitment and resilience will also be needed as this will be an ongoing process
8211496 interventions at any point in the cycle such as ensuring all children attend school thereby lowering the truancy rate will positively affect the cycle outcome
8211497 it can start with something as small as deciding to not bribe the traffic officer when you get pulled over
8211498 chooses the route of significant reduction of demand on the criminal justice system
8211499 for this to become a reality south africans will need to want to make a change and consciously initiate these changes to build a safer country
8211500 south africans need to articulate what a safe south africa looks like and we need to agree indicators that will satisfy everyone that we are moving towards the achievement of that vision
8211501 looking at ways in which each south african can make a difference
8211502 as things currently stand innovation is firmly in the hands of the criminals who hold us to ransom this initiative intends to take back that innovation and use it to stimulate action for a safe south africa
8211503 the theme parks in florida are the most visited attraction in the us and so yes a lot of buyers are looking for both a holiday home but are also looking to rent that property out when theyre not using it
8211504 we are seeing more enquiries for other areas for example places like fort myers on the gulf coast and thats slightly different that appeals to the us retiree market and the local market so were seeing quite a lot of investors looking at other areas of florida and holiday home buyers as well

8211523 i want to move the counseling and student success area forward to enhance the quality services that are provided to students
8211524 it will take the efforts of all the staff members in the various departments i oversee to ensure students continue to receive the quality service they deserve
8211525 the california community colleges provide the most student access to education and i found that very attractive when i decided to apply at pcc

8211528 weve come a long way from even the end of last season
8211529 we were an outside shot at making the playoffs but we were not talented or experienced enough to be playoff worthy we really improved over a rough start to the season and we got a big win over mt san antonio made playoffs in 2007 but realistically we were lacking in several areas
8211530 i like our teams depth especially compared to last season
8211531 last year i couldnt go to the bench without a big drop off in overall team play we put a lot of pressure on our starters to perform price and marshman never left the floor but both proved they could handle the work load now the competition at other positions is strong enough that we should have plenty of our freshmen fighting to get into the rotation
8211532 more importantly we expect to qualify for the regional playoffs once you get there its all about what team wants it more than another to advance we have the added incentive to get as far as the state final eight home court advantage

8211573 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8211574 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8211575 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8211576 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8211577 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8211578 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8211579 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8211580 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8211581 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8211582 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8211583 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8211584 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8211585 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8211586 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8211587 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8211588 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8211589 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8211590 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8211591 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8211592 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8211593 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8211594 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8211595 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8211596 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8211597 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8211598 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8211599 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8211600 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8211601 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8211602 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8211603 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8211604 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8211605 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8211606 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8211607 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8211608 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8211609 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8211610 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8211611 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8211612 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8211613 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8211614 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8211615 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8211616 this is a planning took where all things are going
8211617 the current prevalence of obesity in the uk populations is primarily caused by peoples latent biological susceptibility interacting with a changing environment that includes more sedentary lifestyles and increased dietary abundance
8211618 ever since lindsay got out of rehab and all these people came back into her life things havent been right
8211619 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay she shouldnt be dragging lindsay around nightclubs who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody she is using her for her own gain all these people have inserted themselves into her life like parasites and its not right im done with them
8211620 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement
8211621 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8211622 with the exception of when hes on a lot of drugs
8211623 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8211624 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
8211625 so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
8211626 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8211627 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8211628 for the most part generally hes more often than not not a complete idiot most of the time
8211629 gas prices are too high as you know i do own my own jet and i have been having flying back and forth to la pursuing my acting career
8211630 now if im flying back and forth like twice in a month thats like 200 000 or 250 000 round trip that im back on american airlines right now ok
8211631 check this out your boy diddy right now is on american airlines look
8211632 i want to give a shout out to all my saudi arabian brothers and sisters and all my brothers and sisters from all the countries that have oil if you could all please send me some oil for my jet i would truly appreciate it
8211633 but right now can you believe it i am actually flying commercial thats how high gas prices are ok so i feel you look im at the gate right now
8211634 this is proof that gas prices are too high we need to do something about it so tell whoever the next president is that we need to bring gas back down
8211635 many of us are distraught about the startling withdrawal of stephen colbert from his bid for the presidency
8211636 but now with obama inauguration coundown and mccain inauguration countdown ivoters can look to the future and celebrate the winners in americas political selection process
8211637 educating children about landmines is so vital for childrens futures
8211638 with landmines and unexploded ordnance lying in homes fields rivers and schools in ethiopia and other countries i can really see how unicefs mine risk education is an essential life saving intervention
8211639 it would be good to do south to north america weve done
8211640 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism
8211641 a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy
8211642 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8211643 sales have dropped significantly and the number of indisposed properties increases drastically in the past three months the drop is of 30 40 for the external market and 5 for the domestic while forecasts say that it will continue until the end of the year early 2009
8211644 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8211645 the future of the property market is gloomy due to the slowdown in the number of sales across cyprus the commercial plots and land are exempted since the demand by foreign investors russians mostly who want to expand their business activities to the island is big
8211646 the interest rate increase which pushes monthly installments up is the main reason for the drop in domestic demand which will continue in the next few months
8211647 if the crisis goes on lending will become more difficult for other professional groups too such as hoteliers and traders
8211648 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8211649 as far as im concerned the result of the usa election is a foregone conclusion
8211650 steve didnt just tell me who i should get in touch with to make it happen he introduced me to them
8211651 through this community of people who are involved in spreenkler ive been able to move this idea along and make it even more viable
8211652 if you need a lawyer we wont just give you a list of 25 lawyers in milwaukee and leave it up to you to figure out which one is best
8211653 if we set you up with a resource you are going to be completely prepped for that conversation and they will be prepped for receiving your call we meet you half way
8211654 the premise of spreenkler is to create these pockets so that people who have an idea dont give up on it or leave town they stay and make it happen in the milwaukee region however we can support these ideas keep people energized and keep them focused and continuing on with their plan well do it
8211655 what caught my attention was steves enthusiasm and the groups interest in improving the community
8211656 its a group that doesnt receive the publicity but is quietly and thoughtfully working to make milwaukee a cooler place for young professionals they are bringing to the table enthusiasm ideas and involvement they are taking a glass is half full approach by building on milwaukees strengths its really impressive that this group convenes after work hours brings in a diverse group of speakers and throws out so many ideas for discussion thats commitment
8211657 it sucks but there are 10 other companies that are the same size and five behind that that are following up and 20 behind that that are at the early stages we can continually feed the milwaukee environment with new ideas new businesses and new jobs
8211658 am liebsten w rde ich das ganze jahr dort fahren es ist eine der besten strecke und hoffentlich habe ich ein auto das so funktioniert wie ich es m chte

8211662 if that high wasnt there gustav would have probably just moved north right into the atlantic
8211663 its a biodegradable ribbon which makes it different from most of the ribbons on the market that are petroleum based compound except for silk

8211709 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

8211820 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8211821 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8211822 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8211823 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8211824 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8211825 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8211826 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8211827 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8211828 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8211829 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8211830 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8211831 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8211832 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8211833 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8211834 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
8211835 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
8211836 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
8211837 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
8211838 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
8211839 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
8211840 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
8211841 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
8211842 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
8211843 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
8211844 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
8211845 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
8211846 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
8211847 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
8211848 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
8211849 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
8211850 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
8211851 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
8211852 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8211853 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
8211854 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
8211855 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
8211856 it is clear that sinn fein has always known that no agreement was reached

8211858 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8211859 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8211860 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8211861 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8211862 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8211863 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed

8211865 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8211866 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8211867 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8211868 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8211869 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8211870 no one works for someone we all just work together
8211871 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8211872 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8211873 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8211874 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8211875 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8211876 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8211877 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8211878 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8211879 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8211880 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8211881 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8211882 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8211883 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8211884 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8211885 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8211886 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8211887 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8211888 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8211889 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8211890 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8211891 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8211892 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8211893 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8211894 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8211895 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8211896 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8211897 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8211898 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8211899 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

8212013 look for cables with a verified speed rating above 6 68 gbps or faster to accommodate todays higher data transfer rates better yet choose the fastest speed rated cable available so you are ready when future technologies require even higher data rates such as 10 2 gbps or even over 14 gbps

8212050 if youre going to say anything the time to say it is now
8212051 wir werden sie rund um die uhr berwachen um sicherzustellen dass sich die mutter gut um ihr kleines k mmert
8212052 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8212053 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8212054 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8212055 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8212056 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8212057 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8212058 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8212059 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8212060 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8212061 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8212062 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8212063 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8212064 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8212065 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8212066 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8212067 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8212068 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8212069 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8212070 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8212071 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8212072 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8212073 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8212074 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8212075 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8212076 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8212077 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8212078 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8212079 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8212080 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8212081 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8212082 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8212083 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8212084 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8212085 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8212086 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8212087 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8212088 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8212089 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8212090 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8212091 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8212092 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8212093 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8212094 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8212095 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8212096 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8212097 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8212098 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8212099 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8212100 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8212101 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8212102 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8212103 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8212104 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8212105 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8212106 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8212139 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time

8212142 christians must make an essential distinction between islam as an ideology and muslims as human beings a call to prayer seeks to reduce the fear of islam and increase christians love for muslims in obedience to christs command to love all people and in response to st pauls declaration that perfect love drives out fear
8212143 christians of all denominations need to ask honestly themselves how much do i care do i care enough to say good morning and to pray for muslims people and do i care enough to reach out to them with the love of christ
8212144 we urge as many as possible to join a call to prayer as we seek to love bless and pray for muslim people in britain and around the world throughout the month of ramadan

8212148 son for myself i have no longer any pleasure in anything in this life now that my hopes in this world are satisfied i do not know what more i want here or why i am here
8212149 there was indeed one thing for which i wished to tarry a little in this life and that was that i might see you a catholic christian before i died
8212150 i do not well remember what reply i made to her about this however it was scarcely five days later certainly not much more that she was prostrated by fever
8212151 while she was sick she fainted one day and was for a short time quite unconscious we hurried to her and when she soon regained her senses she looked at me and my brother as we stood by her and said in inquiry
8212152 then looking intently at us dumb in our grief she said
8212153 when she heard this she held him fast with her eye and an anxious face because he cherished such earthly concerns and then gazing at me she said
8212154 on the ninth day of her sickness in the fifty sixth year of her life and the thirty third of mine that religious and devout soul was set loose from the body
8212155 i closed her eyes and there flowed in a great sadness on my heart and it was passing into tears when at the strong command of my mind my eyes sucked back the fountain dry and sorrow was in me like a convulsion but she neither died unhappy nor did she altogether die
8212156 so when the body was carried forth we both went and returned without tears then i slept and when i awoke i found my grief not a little eased and as i lay there on my bed those true verses of ambrose came to my mind for you are truly
8212157 and then little by little there came back to me my former memories of your handmaid her devout life toward you her holy tenderness and attentiveness toward us which had suddenly been taken away from me and it was a solace for me to weep in your sight
8212158 the enthusiastic participation of both contestants and listeners that flooded dhamaal 24s phone lines and road shows testify the incredible popularity of the show in the towns we are pleased that the show has received such great response from our listeners and we too are looking forward to the mega final results

8212160 earlier people had to be satisfied with what they had this has changed today people want more like foreign holidays there is now belief that ones fortunes can change in a lifetime the belief is that we can make big things happen if we do things like educating ourselves as a brand we want people to know that with us they can think big
8212161 our positioning looks to reflect the fact that consumers are increasingly becoming ambitious and are willing to take risks as a company we too are ambitious in what we do and we are looking to convey this message we believe in staying at the consumers side at every stage in his her life and this translates into our new brand positioning our tagline is in hindi as we want to speak the consumers language the tagline also marks the fact that we are now more comfortable in our own skin we will also have separate taglines for the south
8212162 today youngsters are more confident they want more from life max new york life insurance is encouraging them to change the world and do big things this is what comes through in the campaign karo ztaada ka iraada is the new work way the tv highlights the consumers desire to have more the ad is a call for action to wish for more to take actions that deliver more and to constantly beat the status quo i also think that insurance is an exciting category to work with the messaging has progressed from simply trying to get people to take it out of fear or guilt

8212258 sometimes these thunderstorm cells can produce tornadoes and strong straight line winds
8212259 we have an emergency procedures handbook and when anything like this goes on we keep the kids in the school
8212260 by the time the kids were ready to leave and the buses were there the storm had passed
8212261 some of the spruce trees are over 30 feet tall its ripped them right out of the ground
8212262 it picked up a full 45 gallon water barrel and tossed it across the yard like it was empty
8212263 that one must have flown over twenty feet high to hit those trees
8212264 ive seen some storms before but nothing like this you can fix the buildings but the damage to the trees can never be replaced

8212268 whether you are a media man or a supporter you want to see results and points on the board
8212269 but as a manager its all about the performances for me if we play as well as we have done we will win games its just a cliche that winning becomes a habit in the same way losing does
8212270 if your performance level is poor each week you will lose a lot of games but if your performance level is high you will win your fair share
8212271 we know the decision to close any of our branches will cause concern but we believe that these proposals offer the best prospect for a sustainable way forward

8212273 es musste einfach getan werden die offizielle anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit war eine moralische und politische verpflichtung gegen ber den menschen in abchasien und s dossetien nicht mehr und nicht weniger
8212274 goodbye amerika goodbye europa jetzt bleibt dem westen nichts anderes mehr brig als georgien und die ukraine in die nato aufzunehmen
8212275 unser land muss nach ansicht von experten schon bald international mit problemen rechnen aber es d rfte nicht so weit gehen dass wirtschaftliche sanktionen gegen russland verh ngt werden
8212276 diesen schritt haben alle l nder des westens verurteilt gro britannien ruft sogar zur bildung einer internationalen anti russischen koalition auf westliche diplomaten vergleichen das geschehene mit dem 11 september 2001 die weltpolitik werde auch dieses mal eine andere sein als zuvor
8212277 georgiens beispiel zeigt dass die west integration vieler staaten aus dem ehemaligen ostblock zu sp t angegangen wurde
8212278 falls noch jemand ber die motive russlands f r den beginn eines kriegs gegen georgien ger tselt hat sind diese zweifel nun zerstreut moskau hatte seine entscheidung von anfang an getroffen der schutz der ossetier vor einem massaker war nur ein vorwand die panzer in die abtr nnigen georgischen provinzen einrollen zu lassen
8212279 russland hat s dossetien und abchasien anerkannt nachdem die usa und die mehrheit der eu das kosovo anerkannt haben damit wird die scheinheiligkeit der westlichen politiker deutlich die gestern an die grunds tze des internationalen rechts erinnert haben jene grunds tze die sie im vergangenen februar vergessen hatten als pristina die unabh ngigkeit der provinz kosovo ausgerufen hat
8212280 die lehre besteht darin dass wladimir putin sich keinen deut um substanzlose appelle und warnungen von au en schert der begriff offensive trifft das russische agieren wohl am besten wir m ssen bereit sein diesen kampf anzunehmen auch wenn er hei er wird

8212289 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
8212290 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
8212291 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
8212292 if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it
8212293 but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa

8212323 the president of russia is ready for confrontation with the west
8212324 is a bomb set between russia and the wests relations for many years to come
8212325 if our partners want good relations with russia they will understand the reason for our decision and things will be calm but if they choose confrontation well we have lived under such conditions and we can do so again
8212326 russia does not count on wide support for its initiative it is simply doing that which it has become impossible to avoid
8212327 formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is the fulfilment of a moral and political obligation to them no more no less
8212328 it is rather curious if one remembers that less than one month ago the kremlin actively spoke of the need to build a new system of european security and to conclude a new partnership agreement with europe
8212329 this means moscow doesnt intend to completely break with the west but is now ready to hold negotiations only on its own terms
8212330 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8212331 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8212332 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species don t have large negative effects
8212333 indeed most species that get introduced don t have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8212334 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8212335 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8212336 in the case of birds lots of extinctions no change in total biodiversity
8212337 i am asking the pad and demonstrators to withdraw from government house peacefully
8212338 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant
8212339 the pad protests have cost a lot of resources and energy over the past three months and now they are running out of both
8212340 they need to feed the mob with a new objective otherwise people get bored
8212341 i think the leaders will be arrested and this will be a way for the pad to be disbanded without disgrace
8212342 as europe were ten times richer than russia and along with the united states twenty times

8212372 and how many of you would say that you were doing more five years ago and capable of doing more five years ago than you were the five years before that
8212373 so based on your experience how many of you would agree that you will probably be doing more and capable of doing more five years from now than you are today
8212374 well who says you have to be in all of those meetings
8212375 or why do they have to be scheduled back to back
8212376 who says that meetings have to be sixty minutes long what if you scheduled 45 minute meetings your people would be more focused youd get a fifteen minute break between meetings to handle calls and email or prep for the next meeting and it would be easier to enforce a no blackberry usage during meetings rule

8212838 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated
8212839 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8212840 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8212841 our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8212842 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country

8212849 rapid implementation of the guidance is now needed to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need as soon as possible

8213067 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8213068 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8213069 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8213070 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8213071 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8213072 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8213101 weve been offering pandemic preparation classes in each of the northeast georgia counties
8213102 the two hour course tells them what to expect and how to convince the public that this is something that needs to be taken seriously

8213104 we encounter a lot of skepticism i can understand that
8213105 i was skeptical too when i first heard about this but when you watch the video it opens your eyes
8213106 the worst case picture is of widespread absenteeism overflowing hospitals and intermittent or no critical services more likely even in a serious pandemic will be rolling outages and not everyone sick at once hurricane katrina in slow motion the more robust our community services the more likely we will be to get through it with the least pain and suffering

8213109 i think our organization was in favor of it i think its important to get those calls right
8213110 well go along with it im in favor of getting things right if it takes replay then i guess im for replay
8213111 what people dont understand is how it affects you sometimes
8213112 that definitely played a role in that game and then 2 nights later when the phillies lost again after a long rain delay that kind of buried us
8213113 at the same time weve had some go our way
8213114 its all about getting the call right i think thats what everybody wants
8213115 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8213116 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8213117 my opposition to unlimited replay is still very much in play
8213118 i really think the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8213119 i would limit this to in my personal view home runs fair or foul
8213120 i would not go beyond that i think its important to continue to have that human element of people making decisions on the field i think umpires should continue to be an important part of the game
8213121 amnesty has repeatedly called for independent testing while ignoring the mounting independent comprehensive reports showing taser technology is safe and effective anyone living in the real world in which law enforcement officers worldwide have to make split second life or death decisions knows that amnesty internationals report and position is out of step with the needs of law enforcement concerning our proven life saving technology

8213125 choke hold the last resort was deadly force under certain circumstances you may be forced to go from the lowest level on the force policy to the most extreme in an instant in one incident i was involved in one of many during twenty years in the patrol division a domestic dispute the other officer with me took the wife outside to interview her while i interviewed the husband in the living room without warning he bolted down the hallway to their bedroom i got to him just before he got to the loaded shotgun that was leaning against the wall near the bed the other cop was in there just seconds after i got to the guy we booked his ass into valley medical the county hospital i used mace on a number of occasions on people who were not under the influence of meth or pcp it was very effective and it is far more humane than the baton baton strikes are limited to the upper body and the legs they make a real mess if you strike somone in the head but a pcpr will not even notice it but they can break bones brian oldfield who in the mid seventies was the world record holder in the shot put i met him once a truly supreme asshole and who stood about 68

8213129 now we threw the gurney aside and all five of us jumped on the guy we were rolling around on the emergency room floor and i was trying to get my arm around the guys neck while he was trying to get to my gun i put him out before he could reach it i went home early that night
8213130 people worried about global warming fly a lot and so it must not be a serious as they claim
8213131 people worried about global warming fly a lot and so it must not be a serious as they claim
8213132 they dont have to fly by private jet they could fly commercial if theyre not even willing to make that small sacrifice why should i take them seriously
8213133 so if they walked there the science would suddenly change
8213134 any enviro who doesnt live in a cave and eat roots is a hypocrite with automatically wrong positions dont take them seriously
8213135 look at those unbelievably crazy hippies who walk everywhere and grow their own food dont take them seriously
8213136 global warming will dissipate cirrus cloud cover thereby cooling the planet
8213137 i know some climate modelers will say that these results are interesting but that they probably dont apply to long term global warming
8213138 but this represents a fundamental natural cooling process in the atmosphere lets see if climate models can get this part right before we rely on their long term projections
8213139 but some sacrifice would seem to be appropriate under the circumstances
8213140 m not a math person but assuming an even dispersion of delegations if the attendees come from all around the world wouldnt it be roughly the same number of miles to any destination
8213141 the big question that no one can answer right now is whether this enhanced cooling mechanism applies to global warming
8213142 in total the group said it compensated for 2 million tons of carbon which required 7 500 in total donations by som students and faculty
8213143 the models work on the past they should work on the future
8213144 a better use of several square miles of productive agricultural land than feeding thousands
8213145 that said it has to be emphasized that carbon offsetting by tree planting is only a temporary solution a mature forest does not sequester carbon
8213146 nuke plants cant solve everything therefore we shouldnt have any
8213147 important new scientific studies including a recent science article highlight the importance of old growth forest ecosystems as a mechanism to address climate change and provide a powerful new argument for protecting ancient forests new studies indicate that old growth continues to remove carbon even when fully mature and that old and wild forests are better than plantations at dependably removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere huge amounts of carbon are sequestered for long periods in old growth ecosystems both in trees and perhaps more importantly in soils
8213148 in checaumegon bay wisconsin on lake superior the superior lumber company is involved in the recovery of millions of sunken logs 60 feet below the bays surface because the logs have existed for approximately 100 years at large depths and in very cold water they have been preserved almost to perfection most of the old slow growth wood at the bottom of the bay was clearcut in the late 1800s from areas in canada minnesota wisconsin and michigan
8213149 the main corporate presence ive seen at the talks over the years is one of fierce lobbying either by those companies and sectors desperate to avoid emissions curbs or those seeking trading opportunities in carbon markets
8213150 theres no catastrophe please dont force us to cut emission

8213168 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech

8213182 in the name of budgetary support the government is selling away lands this amounts to selling away the future of our children the government should act as a protector of peoples land and not as broker

8213309 once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless and they have no intention of keeping to their word
8213310 its important to have an atmosphere of confidence and trust

8213312 the united states will not let these activities have any effect on final status negotiations including final borders

8213314 israel has stolen thousands of dunams of land from the palestinians israel forbids palestinians to enter and use these lands and uses the settlements to justify numerous violations of palestinian rights such as the right to housing to earn a living and freedom of movement
8213315 the settlers on the other hand benefit from all rights given to citizens of israel who live inside the green line and in some instances even additional rights

8213321 nachdem wir die technischen regeln der wtcc analysiert hatten dachten wir dass der tdi uns gute resultate einbringen w rde
8213322 wir hatten auch keine zweifel daran als sich die meisterschaft im vergangenen jahr etwas schwieriger gestaltete dass wir der aufgabe nicht gewachsen sein k nnten in so einer kurzen zeit ein auto zu entwickeln
8213323 die ergebnisse haben unsere analysen untermauert und wir sind mit unseren erfolgen und unserem innovativen beitrag zu dieser meisterschaft sehr zufrieden

8213328 the impact of climate change on the cedar forests of lebanon will be on natural regeneration because we will have a lack of snow
8213329 secondly there could be an increase of diseases and insect infections because of warmer temperatures
8213330 things could be difficult because the highest point on this mountain is 2000 metres above sea level so the cedar forests in lebanon could disappear
8213331 till now we have healthy cedar forests especially here in the chouf cedar nature reserve
8213332 we are trying to plant new cedar forests we have a project to plant 100 000 seedlings
8213333 you can find the cedar on stamps on money on our national flag so it is very important culturally and its our heritage
8213334 the cedar is always the symbol for strength power fertility continuity and the feeling that the human being is eternal

8213363 first major victory in the battle for the integrity of universities
8213364 of late uclan has been the subject of many attacks by the anti homeopathy league
8213365 colquhoun et al have kept the university lawyers and us quite fruitlessly busy by making claims for very detailed course information under the freedom of information act
8213366 the relentless attacks have taken their toll and it appears that they the critics have won this small victory
8213367 the university continues to be supportive of us and our efforts

8213371 our preparation actually went well we did most of the hard work last week and this week we just used to put the last things in place
8213372 but on monday we had the injury of brok we ran through our structures and then he twisted his ankle right at the end of the training session
8213373 we are now waiting on a verdict from the medical team we have just done all the critical things such as the lineouts and scrums and then he got injured
8213374 schalk and wicus blaauw are looseheads but fortunately jc is a good player and he trained with us many times before
8213375 that is a positive and i am optimistic that he would be up for the task in case we have to call on him
8213376 all the guys realise we are in a position where we must win
8213377 the task is made tougher when you have to play at loftus against a strong team
8213378 but the guys are optimistic despite the situation we find ourselves in we blooded a lot of youngsters in this years competition due to injuries and springbok commitments and i think up until now the forwards fared well
8213379 our line out play thus far has been some of the best in the competition and we scrummed well against the sharks
8213380 one place where we need to improve from a forward point of view is on the ground the bulls are strong there with deon stegmann and wikus van heerden so that will be a big challenge
8213381 if you want to measure yourself it surely should be against the best and this will be a good challenge for them

8213404 our first year goal was to be competitive into the third quarter now our goal is to win
8213405 im hearing people say were going to win this year
8213406 instead of past years when no one thought we were going to win very much i think were going to be competitive
8213407 i came over met the coaches and kind of fell in love with what we were doing
8213408 especially for me being a defensive guy shaw seemed like a great defensive mind
8213409 it doesnt require a lot of practice time or explaining
8213410 we can work on fundamentals every single day we dont have to worry so much about what the opposing offense is going to give us because we dont have many adjustments to make
8213411 ive never seen us play with as much intensity as we did in the camp
8213412 some of us didnt have the plays down last year
8213413 this year were getting it down working on double counts its a confidence boost now that we know we can compete with these opposing teams
8213414 we used to have a semi complicated offense and now we have a simple one
8213415 its really helped out the fluid motion a lot im so much more confident now
8213416 part of that is experience but also drilling since camp just in one year weve come so far
8213417 most of the opposing linemen are still bigger than me but now ive got the smarts to handle them
8213418 for offense weve started to split up between three rotations
8213419 even on defense weve split it up its enabled us to have more specialized groups instead of being more general

8213435 the independent members of baker tilly international desire to develop the brand worldwide and as the largest u s member firm virchow krause became the logical choice to carry the brand in the u s discussions ensued and virchow krause was extremely interested in pursuing this opportunity
8213436 the world is becoming smaller and many of our current clients and the new clients were engaging are involved in international commerce
8213437 representing the baker tilly global brand in the u s will strengthen our ability to provide clients with seamless resources and benefits as they develop business abroad
8213438 we are simply moving forward to change the name of the firm
8213439 the firm has extensive international capabilities in house but the common international brand will greatly reduce the confusion that often occurs when collaborating with other independent member firms throughout the world to serve client needs
8213440 virchow krause has long been a leader in the accounting profession

8213451 two of the individuals had their backs to her she could not see what they looked like or whether they were men or women however they were a similar height to the third individual who she got a good look at
8213452 it is important for us to trace these three and speak to them as they may have important information

8213467 we are working on a modern adaptation of the mayan pyramid
8213468 it is an exciting project that requires a lot of creativity
8213469 the pyramid will house reptiles amphibians fish invertebrates and golden lion tamarins
8213470 the main pyramid will have two floors of exhibit the third level will be used as an observation deck
8213471 we want each exhibit to look different from the others
8213472 the johannesburg zoo has made resources and space available for the captive propagation of these frogs
8213473 as they live both on the land and in the water mainly for breeding purposes frogs are exposed to both water pollution and land pollution
8213474 the fungus originated in south africa from the xenopus laevis these frogs were exported around the world in the 1960s as they were used for pregnancy tests urine was injected into the frogs and if they laid eggs the woman was confirmed to be pregnant

8213481 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged
8213482 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8213483 a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8213484 forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8213485 its important you do your homework and dont cut corners if you lose your copyright you have lost everything your designs and in this case possibly a major business
8213486 this is a chilling example of what can go wrong if people dont nail down the intellectual property rights they believe they have
8213487 clearly ideas are worth multiples of revenue that you can get for them its a long way from a bright idea to putting it down on a piece of paper the jeopardy comes if you dont nail it down right
8213488 the real question now is whether the judge has the stomach to tell mga entertainment that they cant produce these dolls thereby gifting the marketplace to mattel
8213489 most of them are hoping to start training as soon as possible and are interested in any type of trade that will help them secure work on the construction sites in this province
8213490 the interest has been driven by the availability of good paying jobs
8213491 weve grown pretty significantly over the years in trades and that continues
8213492 this has been brewing for a while this is an amazing time to be a young person or an older person getting involved in trades if they are prepared to go where the work is whether it is in alberta or whether it is here locally there is no question about the opportunity they have right now

8213503 deleks portfolio is robust given that it is well balanced by geography and asset class it has high quality tenants with long leases and whilst debt is fairly high 97 percent of it is fixed with an average maturity of 7 4 years
8213504 the current share price is too low and given the groups robust portfolio and the fact that uncertainty over its jelmoli portfolio has now been removed we should start to see investor confidence improve
8213505 operational improvements are beginning to transform communisis into a company with much more significant levels of added value lower capital expenditure and improving management of working capital
8213506 more importantly communisis has removed the most volume oriented part of the operation and the one most exposed to commodity pricing pressure
8213507 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8213508 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
8213509 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
8213510 for most of the children this trip is the first time theyve ever left cambodia
8213511 whats even more exciting is that on september 3 many foster parents will get to meet their foster kids for the first time after years of frequent email correspondence its sure to be a chicken skin moment
8213512 we wanted to bring the kids here so they could meet their foster parents in the flesh as well as experience our american and hawaiian cultures while sharing their own culture with us
8213513 these extremely talented teens represent a positive future for cambodia to see them perform is an inspiring and delightful experience
8213514 the relationship you build with your foster child is powerful
8213515 your encouraging words are so important they soon start calling you mom or dad if you have children they begin to see them as brothers or sisters it really touches your heart to know you are making such a difference in their lives
8213516 the prime minister has been pushing to build these dams very quickly
8213517 we need to make sure the feasibility studies are not rushed and that care is taken in their construction
8213518 they the government had a research team studying the feasibility of the areng project
8213519 but they just kept it private and then stopped studying it
8213520 hydropower development in cambodia has proceeded in the absence of meaningful public consultation and an overall lack of transparency in the decision making process
8213521 were still not certain on the actual roles of the ministry of environment ministry of industry mines and energy and the national electricity authority
8213522 were concerned the government has not been releasing this information publicly but the prime minister seems to be the main decision maker regardless
8213523 we cannot stop the development projects in these areas but we can only ask the government and companies to reduce the environmental impact
8213524 we need it for lower energy prices and for developing cambodia
8213525 were looking at other possibilities between now and the transfer deadline it wouldnt make any difference if they came before thursday because of the uefa ruling even carlos cuellar and luke young arent available
8213526 but until transfer deadline time thats something we will be trying to do you try to look to players who will improve your squad first and foremost then you would maybe be looking at other things in the short term to make sure that your squad is big enough
8213527 its always a possibility in terms of either up to the next window or the one after that but i havent anything significant in mind at the moment in terms of loans
8213528 what we are trying to get is permanent players but its always a possibility
8213529 at the end of it all i would have preferred to have kept shaun but i think he thought his chances were going to be limited in the two positions he could play for us
8213530 in my view thats inaccurate i dont know where thats come from
8213531 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8213532 declines in the present situation index both in terms of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

8213542 i really didnt get the chance to get into the match
8213543 she was serving incredibly well and her first serves were around 125 mph which gave me no chance i felt i was always under pressure
8213544 the foot feels much better but i lost the feeling of playing and that takes time to get back
8213545 its a kind of a second chance for me in my career and i have a lot more influence now on what i am doing
8213546 i have just beaten daniela so thats a great start ranking wise thats the best match i have played this year every win gives you more confidence and i believe i am on my way back
8213547 my serve is a great weapon of mine and i think i have improved it this year
8213548 i was very happy with my first serves because i knew i had to play aggressively against her
8213549 i didnt play for eight to nine months because of everything that was going on behind the tennis lines
8213550 i had time off to re group mentally the final cut came just a couple of months ago
8213551 everything is now over i dont really want to think about the past again i am much more relaxed and happy outside of the court

8213562 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8213563 mccain has a long record of doing that barack obama doesnt
8213564 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8213565 i already know hes going to do good hes very smart
8213566 we need to give him every opportunity to see if he can take us a long way
8213567 again this kid hes very smart he can run he can make all the throws he just hasnt played that much yet but this summer i think he has accepted the fact that hes the quarterback and i think hes done a pretty good job of getting the guys organized throwing the ball around and giving him a chance to develop as the leader of the offense
8213568 thats just the way its been were going to give tommy beecher a chance to run with it
8213569 i know whats expected of me and if i cant get the offense to move at all coach spurrier has been known to have a short leash
8213570 thats to be expected we have to have a quarterback out there thats moving the ball ill be prepared to play and just hope for the best
8213571 its been well documented what kind of young man tommy is
8213572 i think that will help our team i hope it rubs off on the other players he certainly does have a chance to be a quarterback whos a leader because of the way he handles himself and so forth
8213573 he made a lot of mistakes in some scrimmages but i think he improved as we went
8213574 we can see it in the practices better decision making he hasnt played a lot in the games we need to wait until the live action starts flying around here
8213575 hes just a cool dude i guess being behind blake and smelley last year really humbled him hes showing a lot of confidence now hes making the big throws and big plays that we all believe he will make in the game
8213576 i have complete confidence in them that theyll make plays for me and i hope they do have confidence that i can get the ball to them
8213577 i have a pretty easy job getting the ball to them
8213578 this season should be the season i really show what im capable of doing
8213579 my goal is to make a lot of big plays and a lot of big hits just look out im trying to bring all the heat this year
8213580 thats the way most people describe the way i play because i go 100 percent
8213581 some folks symbolized that as a ball of hate because of the way i run to the ball im ok with it
8213582 ive been through a lot and overcame a lot everything ive gone through ive tried to learn something from that
8213583 by the grace of god im still here playing and pushing on ive come a long way and i still have a long way to go
8213584 just stay prayed up and continue to have faith in god and let him lead my way
8213585 hes got his head on straight and he works hard on his academics its a struggle to go to college as a student athlete and then you throw having a family on top of that there were some times that were disappointing but hes growing up hes going to be a good player for us
8213586 expect a strong healthy tray blackmon playing hard every game
8213587 my goal is definitely to make a lot of plays and contribute to the team i want to get through a whole season without injury i feel real good right now coming out of camp i have some little nicks and bruises but nothing major i feel 100 percent
8213588 we plan to win every game we play and take it all the way
8213589 i know we have some hard games but i think this will be one of the best teams auburn has had in a while were all level headed guys and on the same page and i think this team could be something special
8213590 were unique for our fans in that we have three huge rivalries
8213591 to me we even take it a step further i always say your rivalries are your league games because thats your goal every year to win a conference championship

8213613 the results presented here demonstrate that the addition of colourless rose petal polyphenols acting as co pigments significantly reduces the thermal degradation of strawberry in model solutions thus bringing about enhanced colour stability even at a molar pigment co pigment ratio of 1 2
8213614 in contrast to the addition of rosemary and thyme extracts which have been used as anthocyanin stabilizing agents at a 1 100 c opigmentation ratio rose petal polyphenols are effective at much lower concentrations thus allowing an economically viable stabilization method
8213615 therefore the substitution of synthetic food colorants by their natural counterparts and the development of methods to stabilize natural pigments are of utmost importance to meet consumer demands for safer and healthier food
8213616 the results obtained demonstrate that the addition of rose petal polyphenols slows the thermal degradation of strawberry anthocyanins thus resulting in improved colour retention without affecting the gustatory quality of the product

8213625 the jurys verdict is only one stage in deciding what relief mattel will ultimately be entitled to for mgas and mga boss isaac larians misconduct and we will await the courts final decisions on damages and other relief to which mattel is entitled

8213638 for the core business we are trying to expand into new areas like india the middle east and other new countries
8213639 it raymonds open source concept accepted the idea of commercial interests from the start
8213640 it saw new business models evolving from shared development effort
8213641 isnt open source a community based movement that was set to overtake the world of commercial software wasnt the famous lamp stack linux apache mysql and perl python and php going to open a world in which software existed outside the traditional realm of property
8213642 it is almost impossible to tell the difference between the most popular open source software and commercial alternatives
8213643 what tends to get lost is this the fact that business is friendly to foss does not mean that it has adopted its values
8213644 the free software camps concern with philosophical and political freedom has almost certainly not been adopted by most foss friendly companies while the open source camps emphasis on increased software quality is probably shared by middle management at best business gasp is interested in foss to improve the bottom line and often no other reason
8213645 there isnt a grand contradiction between giving code away seeding the market and suggesting a purchase reaping the market in fact the two go together perfectly as we realize this open source will become even more dominant open source and business can be bosom buddies not enemies
8213646 sooner or later an open source business is going to act more like a business and less like a citizen of the foss community
8213647 the two can certainly co exist and both can benefit from doing so but forced to choose the average foss based business is going to choose business interests over foss every time

8213651 we strongly advise you not to travel to mindanao including mainland mindanao the zamboanga peninsula and the sulu archipelago due to the very high threat of terrorist attack including kidnapping and related counter terrorism operations
8213652 at about 2 700 points now a waiting game is being played out
8213653 investors are not ready to move out of the sidelines yet and start investing seriously
8213654 trotz schwieriger marktbedingungen haben wir ein zufriedenstellendes ergebnis erreicht es ist ein kompliment an die kompetenz der sparkassenberater deren empfehlungen die kunden offensichtlich sch tzen und an die qualit t unserer produkte
8213655 hoxe temos aqu o telonero unha delicia que o sr rajoy visite galicia porque eso lle vai permitir ver as obras que eles nunca fixeron
8213656 os socialistas valoran moi positivamente a visita que realiza o presidente do goberno e secretario xeral do psoe jos luis rodr guez zapatero para n s extremadamente importante esta visita e enorgull cenos doblemente xa que por un lado un reco ecemento ao goberno galego polo seu esforzo inversor no desenvolvemento das infraestruturas e e por outro lado esta visita ven a concretar a po er negro sobre branco no impulso ao investimento do goberno central
8213657 the ground has dried up nicely and they are ready to roll
8213658 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8213659 i had a first option and a second option that were not possible
8213660 i knew at the time that the club was doing everything possible to get these two players that i wanted or one of them who was not possible but for different reasons and when i was faced with the possibility of shevchenko i said yes because he is no doubts about it a player of high quality
8213661 he was like a prince in milan and in chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody is the same no statues everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove that he deserves to play so i think that maybe he lost some self confidence
8213662 you know the different factors a different life a different club a different league a different environment and step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8213663 i believe that in the future he will again be a player of high quality but maybe he needs the change a different challenge and a different environment to be happy
8213664 he is a very good player and to be fair i wish him to become again the sheva that everybody including myself admires
8213665 planet shoes is passionate about the environment we carry environmentally friendly shoes including earth shoes and likewise we want to find ways to green our business processes were already participating in a number of green programs including encouraging ride share with nuride com and 1 for the planet when we learned about the option of purchasing carbon offsets to lower the carbon footprint of shipping materials and transport we seized the opportunity this is a program where we can literally partner with our customers to improve the environment
8213666 when youre talking about carbon footprints what better partner than an online shoe company
8213667 planet shoes is looking out for the planet by ensuring that the only footprint you leave behind is the one from your stylish new shoes and not from your carbon impact we are so pleased that planet shoes is stepping forward to take a leadership position in protecting our environment
8213668 not everyone has the means to implement clean energy technology in their home or even to substantially reduce their gas and oil consumption at least not to the point where they could make a profound individual impact
8213669 by helping our customers to purchase carbon offsets we feel like were making a difference and helping our customers to do the same in a very painless way if we all work together we can combat environmental damage and can use business ethics to further the environmental cause
8213670 i am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute in this way
8213671 to an industry poised i believe in the short term to bring significant new therapeutic and commercial successes to market the journal regenerative medicine in addition to great science offers a unique focus on commercialization and industry challenges that will be critical to the success of this field it is on those issues for the cell therapy sector that i look to contribute to the journal and the industry as a whole
8213672 i have been in the cissp world for more than 10 years now
8213673 i have taught it for about eight years for corporate and government agencies i have written books on it developed products webinars study materials etc
8213674 over the years i have noticed that students who are attempting to achieve their cissp have changed their approach rather than fully understanding the topics in the common body of knowledge cbk many individuals are simply memorizing the key components they will most likely see on the exam individuals the companies they work for and the industry as a whole are all cheated by this approach
8213675 taking advantage of self paced learning can better prepare students for the cissp certification exam and for future challenges they will face in the field
8213676 although this does affect our bottom line i think it is critical that people actually learn the security information otherwise we are all wasting our time
8213677 we have changed our model of teaching by providing students with study material in several formats to help them properly prepare themselves for our five day cissp course
8213678 i know many peoples goal is to be able to have cissp after their name on their business cards but our goal is to ensure that the effort of studying is directly beneficial to the individual their company and the industry overall
8213679 i want to be director of rugby in south africa
8213680 i dont want to be in the limelight and im not looking for the pressures that go with it ive had my turn
8213681 all id like to do is help thats what i have always wanted to do
8213682 there are too many forwards standing around in the backline
8213683 they try to do half of what we did and half of their own thing half of everything leaves you with nothing
8213684 updating our website is something we have been working on for the past several months
8213685 it is simple and user friendly for our visitors and we are extremely pleased with the outcome
8213686 we are releasing version 4 of our tlm platform in september
8213687 so we thought that openworld and the intel inside innovation showcase would be a great opportunity to introduce a key component of tlm to the it community at large
8213688 even though were focusing our demo on the tlm repository
8213689 tlm 4 0 has a boatload of new features improved source code analysis redesigned code generation a modernization dashboard and integration of videos the tlm 4 methodology and toolset is making it cheaper easier and safer than ever to modernize your legacy system
8213690 i am very aware that there is a lot of disquiet out there about his re appointment
8213691 but the bottom line is that clubs are going to have their say on the matter on monday night
8213692 there is no point in them contacting me and other people about being unhappy with the situation setanta readers comment of the day yes but refs have to be given power to stamp it out
8213693 oh thats a given george the only question is which of them will draw the greater quantity the guy struggling with his anger issues or the woman who will profess full support while deftly wielding a surgeons scalpel
8213694 gay rights if its morally wrong it cant be politically correct
8213695 we set out to create a fund that mirrored the way we manage individual client accounts
8213696 recognition of our 10 year track record is great news we held on to our philosophy we didnt style drift it pays off especially in markets like this
8213697 we have a really high quality portfolio and balance sheets do matter in the end
8213698 we follow a strict financial philosophy and companies must meet our stringent criteria before we even consider them
8213699 the hi tech business community in israel is always excited when jeff visits to speak i am honored to be taking part sharing the stage with such a personality its becoming increasingly important to keep ahead of the latest ideologies and techniques of internet marketing our clients always expect cutting edge strategies and currently social media marketing tops the list of whats emerging in search engine marketing this event will provide us seo experts and enthusiasts a chance to learn from one another and meet the faces behind the websites and blogs
8213700 all you are thinking is that you have to survive
8213701 its a lot steeper than everest basically its a giant pyramid
8213702 there are no easy routes theyre all hard it also has its own weather system the good weather rarely lasts long enough to complete an ascent
8213703 i had been walking for four or five hours and it was starting to get light
8213704 you choose between life or the mountain at the time you are asking yourself is this the right decision but afterwards you realise its the right decision
8213705 rolf was on the wrong place at the wrong time but since k2 was one of rolfs dreams we have also said that he was at the right place at the wrong time
8213706 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
8213707 we were very tired we said then that we would bivouac camp for the night
8213708 just turning over in your sleeping bag can leave you fighting for breath
8213709 i had not drunk for 16 hours it was 8 000m and it was freezing cold
8213710 all of a sudden i saw an avalanche coming down it was only 20 metres to my right i saw the body of gerard sweep past me
8213711 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
8213712 i was able to help marco i found him at 8 000m he was sitting in the snow unconscious he was completely flat lying down i had taken one small bottle of oxygen for emergencies and i was able to use that after about 10 or 15 minutes he started to move and became conscious
8213713 tonight will surely be yet another test of their courage as their limbs are thawed and the extent of their injuries is revealed
8213714 they were thinking of my gas my rope or whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
8213715 its hard to believe but our passion is in the mountains
8213716 if you die in the mountains it happens at the highlight of your life you are living for your passion if you die when you are 90 then that is great but for mountaineers its acceptable to die where your heart is
8213717 crossing boundaries towards a new hermeneutics of dumb pimps like bruce willis
8213718 as a dog returneth to its own vomit so doth l a
8213719 but wilson is no mere shock jock and while her revelations about pop culture occasionally restate the obvious they do so in terms so hilariously biting as to render them almost canonical
8213720 a ll a savvy promoter with the naked greed of a pederast svengali needs to do is find some mildly talented teens all lousy with fresh libido and stuck in some lame section of america promise them a bucking eight second ride on the magic bull of fame and he or she can forge a sensational golden windfall as long as the kid stays on after all that happens successfully the stars might figure out that are giving 90 percent of their salary away to some carpet chested cigar aficionado who tells them what they can and cant wear all the time and decide theyd like to try their hand at going solo a career move that has only really worked so far for ex menudo boy keep in mind that this was published in 2000 the managers of the new breed of band coming out must have the whole clause in the contract that says when the boys are too old and fat for the metallic plastic jumpsuits and have squandered all 10 percent they owned of their careers they are not allowed to appeal to any human tendencies in the manager and beg them for more cash to get back on their feet there ought to be a child corruption czar in government maybe somebody who can keep the pop machine honest if not clean
8213721 what if i interview experts who already have products and pick their brains about listbuilding
8213722 startet er dann zum beispiel gmail mit einer neuen e mail in der entwurfsansicht
8213723 die gefahr dass ein kapital und zeitintensives gro projekt scheitert ist dann erheblich geringer
8213724 arbeitnehmerinnen und arbeitnehmern steht ein fairer anteil am erfolg der unternehmen zu f r die sie ihre arbeitskraft einsetzen
8213725 wird das sie selbst die spd in hessen und die bundes spd vor der bundestagswahl schwer besch digen
8213726 ist sie abh ngig von der linken und den traumata des herrn lafontaine sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8213727 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde darauf hat franz m ntefering schon im februar hingewiesen
8213728 die auf eine vereinigung mit der linkspartei oskar lafontaines zuzusteuern scheinen
8213729 i sure hope you give equal positive time to the republican convention
8213730 badlandgrl one can only hope but dont hold your breath as it is obvious that the media is still all starry eyed and agaa gaa over their picks and we already know just how tolerant they are to dissenting opinions
8213731 joe biden ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
8213732 as i have said for a year the democrats do not have an electable candidate
8213733 if the incident over night is any indication how the convention is going to go then it will be true to form and all wet
8213734 i hope there is lots of kool aid to go around
8213735 mark and freeport will have to eat their words mark my words
8213736 no one needs to be persuaded that the country is on the wrong track
8213737 speaches at a convention are not what makes a president
8213738 abouttime you forgot to criticize the failed democrat controlled congress is that an inconvenient truth
8213739 former president jimmy carter paid tribute to democratic presidential candidate barack obama yesterday night via videotape in it he said this
8213740 barack obamas been out here in areas ravaged by hurricane katrina to reach out to people and he has deep awareness of whats going on in the gulf region his deep religious faith and his background as someone whos come from nowhere you might say to a high position in the political world all of that i think bodes well for america i dont have any doubt that when we have a democrat back in the white house this january barack obama he will make sure this never happens again
8213741 this is the first time in my adult life that i am proud of my country
8213742 obama may not love his brother living in a hut in kenya surviving on one dollar a week
8213743 i have to admit i am totally enjoying the democrat convention the backbitting the backstabbing the whining and crying from the hillary supporters
8213744 shawana are you playing the race card on the blog
8213745 i am adhering to dr kings dream that i judge a person not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character and barack obama is not yet ready for the presidency i believe he will be an effective leader some day now is not his time no we cant
8213746 interesting that the vast majority of speakers are far left liberals
8213747 i dont believe theres an obama living in a hut in kenya
8213748 barack obama may not do well in conservative little napa but he will take california and take this country by storm
8213749 is it just me or is this fracturing of the democrat party a godsend for conservatives the new progressives behind nobama amp liberal elitists behind hill wow
8213750 there will absolutely not be an xbox 360 version of final fantasy xiii for japan
8213751 use social networks like facebook flickr youtube twitter and friendfeed to share information with friends and family despite their familiarity with these platforms 81 survey respondents did not believe these types of platforms could hurt their businesses
8213752 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online
8213753 this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best its important that as the web hosting industry moves forward we understand that internet users are seeking a customized personalized internet experience for both personal and professional reasons ultimately its about customer relationships providers and resellers need to work together to provide the support services and infrastructure that give users the best experience
8213754 i wanted to make a blog on vocations one where everybody could bring their own experiences
8213755 i wanted to create a showcase for the pastoral experience of nuns
8213756 instead they made it look like it was a catwalk a la miss italy
8213757 will parliament function normally this fall where the government is the government and the opposition is the opposition anarchy or where the opposition is the bartolucci weighs in on legacy
8213758 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
8213759 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
8213760 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
8213761 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
8213762 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
8213763 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
8213764 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
8213765 wir waren berw ltigt von der gastfreundschaft die uns entgegengebracht wurde
8213766 nach unseren erfahrungen sichern sich unsere kunden zwar immer dann den g nstigsten preis wenn sie so lange wie m glich im voraus buchen doch wenn die mietwagenanbieter am ort zum ende der hauptsaison freie kapazit ten haben gehen die preise teilweise auch wieder nach unten
8213767 der gesamtschaden durch wirtschaftskriminelle handlungen bel uft sich allein in deutschland auf j hrlich etwa sechs milliarden euro die dunkelziffer d rfte dabei noch weitaus h her liegen trotzdem sind sich viele der gefahr noch nicht bewusst und untersch tzen das risiko
8213768 compliance ist ein schutzprogramm f r unternehmen und sorgt f r transparenz innerhalb der gesch ftsprozesse
8213769 unsere kunden erhalten ein komplettpaket bestehend aus pr ventiv und aufdeckungsma nahmen das individuell auf ihre unternehmensprozesse zugeschnitten ist
8213770 im anschluss an unsere untersuchung stellen wir dem potenziellen kunden sein pers nliches compliance l sungspaket vor und veranschaulichen unsere ergebnisse anhand einer ad hoc analyse seiner echtdaten
8213771 f r uns ist diese kooperation ein wichtiger schritt um unsere kompetenz bei der bek mpfung von wirtschaftskriminalit t weiter auszubauen wir wissen mit skytec einen starken partner an unserer seite und freuen uns sehr auf die zusammenarbeit
8213772 compliance stellt f r die unternehmen die chance dar mit fairness auf den m rkten zu agieren und die unternehmenskultur zu st rken
8213773 im marktvergleich haben wir zu viele und zu kleine service center die bauliche und auch die technische ausstattung insgesamt entspricht l ngst nicht mehr dem erforderlichen branchenstandard um f r unsere kunden noch besser zu werden und den mitarbeitern bessere arbeitsbedingungen zu bieten wollen wir innerhalb der n chsten zwei jahre in 24 st dten die vorhandenen service center zu modernen und attraktiven zentren ausbauen in denen unsere mitarbeiter gut arbeiten k nnen und dies auch gerne tun
8213774 gleichzeitig bleiben wir mit unseren service centern in der fl che deutschlands vertreten da wir bei der planung darauf geachtet haben dass die 24 st dte ber das ganze bundesgebiet verteilt sind eine verlagerung ins ausland wie es andere unternehmen tun ist f r uns berhaupt kein thema
8213775 wir brauchen also gr ere standorte mit der neuen struktur kommen wir auf eine durchschnittliche standortgr e von etwa 700 mitarbeitern auf dieser basis sind service center wie sie f r die anforderungen eines modernen telekommunikationsunternehmens wie der deutschen telekom notwendig sind wesentlich wirtschaftlicher zu betreiben damit haben wir eine gute balance zwischen zeitgem en arbeitsplatzbedingungen und betriebswirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten gefunden wie z b branchen bliche kosten f r informationssysteme sowie ausstattungs und mietkosten
8213776 daf r haben wir sogar den einen oder anderen kleineren standort in das neue konzept aufgenommen
8213777 das spornt an f hrt zu besseren ergebnissen und ist damit gut f r unsere kunden
8213778 bei der auswahl der 24 st dte haben wir intensiv gepr ft wie die notwendige zusammenlegung f r unternehmen und mitarbeiter bestm glich realisiert werden kann nat rlich wird es f r einen teil der mitarbeiter dadurch l ngere fahrtzeiten zum arbeitsplatz geben
8213779 auch hier streben wir sozialvertr gliche l sungen an sollte in einzelf llen aber aufgrund von speziellen berufs und lebenssituationen die fahrt zum neuen arbeitsplatz oder ein umzug f r eine mitarbeiterin oder einen mitarbeiter nicht m glich sein werden wir nach kr ften l sungen suchen
8213780 die eingliederung der technik zentren ist ein logischer und konsequenter schritt der aus der gr ndung der deutschen telekom netzproduktion gmbh vor mehr als einem jahr folgt
8213781 schon damals haben wir die vollst ndige b ndelung der technikkompetenzen erwogen aber aufgrund der komplexit t zun chst zur ckgestellt heute blicken wir auf mehr als ein jahr positiver erfahrungen bei den servicegesellschaften zur ck telekom service und die damit verbundene st rkung unternehmerischer verantwortung hat sich bew hrt
8213782 ja die mitarbeiter werden beispielsweise die gleiche wochenarbeitszeit wie ihre kollegen haben also statt 34 dann 38 stunden arbeiten und auch das gehalt soll auf das niveau der servicegesellschaften gebracht werden nat rlich mit den bekannten abfederungen damit st rken wir die wirtschaftliche leistungsf higkeit unserer netzproduktion im interesse unserer kunden und damit letztlich auch unserer mitarbeiter
8213783 escrib el primer borrador del gui n y me ha llevado 2 a os hacerlo porque honestamente hice entre medios tambi n es verdad que lo termin justo antes de la huelga de guionistas de hollywood y para ser sinceros es una de las cosas m s divertidas que he escrito
8213784 att s rja och b ra lidande r d rf r ingen s llsynt rt f r de kristna ven om det till det yttre inte ser s ut ven om de g rna vill vara glada i kristus ocks i yttre avseende s gott det g r ty dagligen m ste de se och k nna sm rta i sina hj rtan n r de betraktar denna v rld med s mycken elakhet vermod f rakt och sm dande av gud och hans heliga ord d rtill allt det el nde och all olycka som dj vulen anstiftar s v l i det andliga som i det v rldsliga regementet d rf r kan de inte hysa s rskilt m nga glada tankar och deras andliga gl dje blir mycket d mpad s tt nu bara ig ng med att bli en sann kristen s f r du nog l ra dig vad det vill s ga att s rja och b ra lidanden
8213785 detta betygar aposteln s t jakob en i sanning obarmh rtig dom skall g ut ver dem som inte har bevisat barmh rtighet d rf r skall herren kristus p den yttersta dra fram enbart k rleksl sheten som det v rsta av allt all k rleksl shet vi visat mot v r medm nniska och r kna det som om vi visat det mot honom
8213786 till den som umg s med m nniskor kommer inga nglar
8213787 nej att se gud det g r du n r du har den r tta tron n mligen att kristus r din fr lsare
8213788 men den som griper som guds ord och h ller fast vid detta i tro han kan bli kvar inf r gud och anser honom som sin n derike fader han beh ver inte frukta att denne fader st r d r med piskan i beredskap han kan vara s ker p att gud med v lbehag ser ned p honom ja ler mot honom tillsammans med alla nglarna och helgonen i himlen
8213789 och vi r s snedvridna varelser att vi bara s ker leta upp s dant som r snuskigt och stinker och sedan likt suggan v llustigt v ltrar oss i det
8213790 vill du s ledes vara ett guds barn s r kna med att rusta dig f r f rf ljelse
8213791 ty eftersom kristus har gett mig sitt erk nnande och sitt vitsord s m ste alla nglar ja sol och m ne och alla skapade varelser s ga sitt
8213792 ty brist p salt sprider sig som ett behagligt gift och g r den gamle adam s innerligt bel ten han tycker n mligen inte om att uts ttas f r faror v ga liv och lem eller utst skam och f rol mpningar i konsten att undvika detta r v ra biskopar och andliga f de de skickligaste p denna jord dock som de grymma sj lvsp kare de r ombes rjer de inte ett herrens biskops mbete utan snarare dj vulens och f rtj nar allts inte ens att kalls f r salt utan s lta ty de predikar s att de inte skall l pa minsta risk utan kan sitta kvar p sina f rm genheter och egendomar och d rtill ha ra och makt ty den som m ste f rbanna hela v rlden kejsare kungar och furstar visa och l rda och s ga dem att deras v sen r f rd melsev rt inf r gud han m ste r cka b deln huvudet d remot om jag hycklar som om allt stod r tt till d r det ingen som sl r mig och jag f r njuta gunst och ra m m
8213793 detta var s ledes ett varningens ord som herren uttalat att n r saltet mister sin s lta r det inte mer till n gon nytta
8213794 detta r den andra delen av det mbete som herren l gger de k ra apostlarna de skall kallas och vara v rldens ljus n mligen undervisa och visa sj larna v gen till det eviga livet d rmed r hela v rlden st lld under apostlarnas f gderi och skall och m ste upplysas av dem utan dem r v rlden n mligen m rk och f rblindad trots allt den annars kan stadkomma ty om v rlden hade ett ljus f rutom apostlarna som kunde upplysa den n got som den menar sig ha till vad skulle den d beh va apostlarna
8213795 s vill herren nu s ga oss vill ni vara mina predikanter m ste ni i sanning vara rustade att st lla er till f rfogande och tr da fram inf r hela v rlden liksom p ett h gt berg s att ni frimodigt l ter er ses och offentligen h ras vare sig det gagnar h g eller l g ska ni inte f rtiga n got f r n gon eller tala
8213796 men detta som herre nu s ger f r att m nniskorna ska era goda g rningar och prisa er fader som r i himmelen det r sagt med evangelisten s t matteus s tt att tala han som brukar framh lla just g rningarna ty han tillsammans med de tv andra evangelisterna s t markus och s t lukas f rsvarar i sitt evangelium inte i s h g grad och lika utf rligt som s t johannes och s t paulus den h ga trosartikeln om kristus i st llet talar och f rmanar de tre f rstn mnda desto mer om de goda g rningarna och s skall det ju vara i kristenheten att man ivrar f r b da dock s att man g r r ttvisa t vart och ett allt efter deras egenart och v rdighet f rst framh va kristus och tron p honom som den h gsta trosartikeln och d refter den om de goda g rningarna eftersom nu evangelisten s t johannes rakt igenom s kraftfullt drivit trons huvudartikel och d rf r rimligtvis b r anses som den fr mste och f rn maste evangelisten s gnade sig s t matteus s t markus och s t lukas t det andra huvudstycket och framh ll starkt att g rningarna inte fick gl mmas bort de r allts i det avseendet f rmer n s t johannes och denne p sitt s tt f rmer n de andra tre
8213797 d rf r r en r tt kristens enda riktigt tillf rlitliga k nnetecken p goda g rningar att han predikar och prisar kristus s att folk l r sig att de r ingenting och kristus allt
8213798 d rf r det vara den sanna sk na konsten om den har jag talat utf rligare i min skrift om br llop och ktenskaplig samlevnad och det starkaste skyddet mot otukt om varje m nniska l rde sig att betrakta sin make respektive maka i ljuset av guds ord som r den yppersta skatt och sk naste klenod som man och kvinna kan finna speglade man sig i den s skulle mannen s kert ha sin hustru k r och dyrbar som en gudomlig g va och klenod fick han d syn p en annan kvinna l t vara vackrare n hans egen s skulle han t nka hon r vacker men om hon n var den sk naste p jorden s r hon dock inte lika sk n som det mycket sk nare smycke som jag har d rhemma i min hustru henne har gud gett mig och med sitt ord smyckat t mig f re alla andra om hon n till sitt yttre inte r s bildsk n och i vrigt inte helt full ndad
8213799 ty den f rsta f r lskelsen och nyhetens behag betyder inte allt och varar inte l nge om inte gud ger sin v lsignelse och lycka och hj lper till s att du orkar med tminstone sm rre obehag l r du dig inte detta f rst utan st rtar dig huvudstupa in i ktenskapet som om du inte beh vde gud d l r du troligen inte veta hut senare heller rimligtvis g r det d s att du f r ett helvete och sk rseld i huset utan att dj vulen beh vt hj lpa till f rm r du sedan inte heller ta det minsta lilla obehag med j mnmod bara fodrar att allt skall d dig v l i h nder och s till r ga p allt gjort dig av med och avskaffat artikeln om syndernas f rl telse s har du i geng ld f tt ett anklagande och oroligt hj rta du drabbas av dubbel olycka och f r otack till l n
8213800 h rtill kommer nnu ett missbruk som florerar inte minst i v r egen tid n mligen att man sv r s l ttsinnigt att man vid vart och vartannat ord blandar in guds namn

8213810 the research does indicate that there is a relationship between advertising and childrens food and beverage preferences and requests
8213811 it also indicates a relationship between television viewing as distinct from television advertising specifically and obesity in children
8213812 however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity indeed only a modest association is apparent
8213813 whilst a well informed debate about the potential impact of food advertising during childrens programming is important evidence to support advertising bans as a solution to childhood obesity does not stack up
8213814 ya beginilah pak kalau sudah tua dari mana lagi saya cari uang keahlian dan pengetahuan saya hanya di asuransi saja

8213816 dulu pernah saya memprospek seorang pedagang kaki lima namun ia selalu tidak tertarik dengan alasan uang makan saja pas pasaan apalagi untuk bayar premi setelah saya jelaskan berulang ulang akhirnya dia mau juga malahan dia rela meminjam dari rentenir untuk membayar preminya sekarang dia bisa mengantarkan semua anaknya lulus sekolah
8213817 dulu saya pernah memprospek seoarang bapak namanya pak maman dia selalu bilang ga punya uang apalagi anak anakanya banyak dan butuh biaya untuk menghidupi keluarga namun saya terus berkunjung kerumahnya meski saya tahu dia tetap tidak akan mau bergabung namun saya pikir hal yang utama adalah menjaga hubungan baik suatu saat saya berkunjung kerumah pak maman bertepatan dengan hari pernikahan anaknya setelah ngobrol lama dan menyantap hidangan maka saya selipkan sedikit mengenai produk asuransi gayungpun bersambut dia mengajak ku menghitung jumlah uang yang ada di kotak amplop yang diterimanya dari undangan yang datang setelah itu dia menyuruhku membawa semuanya untuk dijadikan premi saat itu air mata saya langsung menetes sendirinya perjuanganku akhirnya berhasil dan dihargai sebesar uang pernikahan anakknya

8213823 this decision was taken at the highest level of the pentagon
8213824 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8213825 i would prefer to see russia co operate and integrate with the broadly defined west but if it seeks confrontation it will lose again
8213826 as europe we are ten times richer than russia and along with the united states twenty times
8213827 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve
8213828 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
8213829 clients will benefit from the combined scale and strength of our companies as they transform their technology environments
8213830 this is an important step forward in our ability to help them solve their challenges through practical innovations that deliver valuable business outcomes
8213831 even with ongoing global economic pressures we continue to be upbeat but very cautious about the outcome of this deal
8213832 as weve said from the time this deal was announced in may hp faces a laundry list of integration issues with eds financial organisational operational and cultural and interestingly cultural issues may present some of the highest hurdles
8213833 hp has already said it intends to merge the two companies outsourcing groups which will clearly make hp an even more dominant force in infrastructure and increasingly application related services
8213834 while an economic slowdown may force customers to delay some it investments it can also open up new outsourcing avenues as customers turn to third parties to operate various aspects of their it more efficiently

8213859 it is very sad that the two newspapers which have given hartlepool united the most coverage home and away for many years should be treated in this way

8213870 my optimism about new signings gets less the nearer we get to the deadline
8213871 if we dont then we will have to soldier on with what we have but hopefully we will still get a couple in
8213872 if we dont get anyone in then well have to wait for our strikers to get fit but we have six strikers out at the moment and viduka martins and duff are all going to be out for three or four weeks were stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment
8213873 james has a three year contract with us at the moment
8213874 he wont be involved against forest or sunday because he has had a slight injury but he should be fine after that
8213875 the beauty is that after sunday we have two weeks to play with in terms of the international break so i think we signed him at a good time
8213876 he is 23 very raw he is learning his trade
8213877 he has made plenty of mistakes like you see lots of centre halves do every week but he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8213878 maybe anton needed a new environment to get his career on to a new level again i think it is one of the deals we are doing which suits everybody he knows the premier league he is english a good price so it suits everyone but it will be up to anton if he goes up to the next level

8213880 in holy scripture the same word does not always mean the same thing
8213881 the cabman mounted the box the child was pleased with his christmas box
8213882 the obvious literal meaning of a scripture is not always the true one and ignorant persons are apt enough to fall into the most singular misconceptions a judicious remark from the pulpit will be of signal service many persons have accustomed themselves to misunderstand certain texts they have learned wrong interpretations in their youth and will never know better unless the correct meaning be indicated to them
8213883 do not be carried away with new meanings plymouth brethren delight to fish up some hitherto undiscovered tadpole of interpretation and cry it round the town as a rare dainty let us be content with more ordinary and more wholesome fishery no one text is to be exalted above the plain analogy of faith and no solitary expression is to shape our theology for us other men and wiser men have expounded before us and anything undiscovered by them it were well to put to test and trial before we boast too loudly of the treasure trove
8213884 the ball will seam around but the pitch will probably take spin as well so if it looks like being sunny for the next few days we might need two spinners
8213885 when you look at the clubs hes managed and whats hes won lots of clubs dont have a great history but he created a history at nottingham forest
8213886 we sunderland were there a few weeks ago and you still felt as though brian clough was there
8213887 hes left his mark at the city ground which is the sign of a great manager legacy theyve got history behind them they have european stories to tell and cloughie ensured they have the trophies to back them up
8213888 he would have made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football
8213889 the modern day player would be able to put up with him if he was still around now players would love to play for him because he was different
8213890 lets not forget he knew his stuff although he might not be able to get away with things now that he used to such as going on the pitch and smacking a few fans
8213891 there were loads of incidents that stick in my mind but i suppose theres always the one when i made my debut at liverpool
8213892 i ended up at his house on the way to anfield before the game
8213893 i was there in the middle of his family environment brian clough and his wife were having a few words and i remember thinking this is great right in the middle of a family domestic
8213894 then after i made my debut he came in and asked me my name gave me a pair of his shoes and told me to go and polish them i knew he was keeping my feet on the ground
8213895 i also used to love the fact that when he came down the training ground hed bring his dog you always knew when he was in because you saw his dog del boy he loved his dogs
8213896 he was a kind gentleman as well and did loads of stuff for charity hes sadly missed
8213897 there are no real words of wisdom or advice i have taken with me because he didnt really speak to us that much
8213898 he made us all get in a five a side goal one day which i thought was brilliant we were all crammed in this goal for no reason if someone did that today youd be thinking how has this lad got his a or pro licence he made us all get in this five a side goal the whole forest first team we were all squashed in there why dunno he just said all of you get in that goal it was like a big game of twister

8213912 we have done a lot of hard work these boys put their heart and soul into preparing for these games and the results are there for everyone to see we may have won just one bronze medal but the overall impact of our performance would be far reaching

8213928 my son called me to tell me there were eight dead piglets in the farrowing hut which is like a maternity unit for pigs
8213929 at first i couldnt understand why so many were dead so my first thought was that it could be foot and mouth
8213930 a similar thing happened on the same piece of land last year
8213931 on that occasion someone shot the front window of a tractor and completely blew out the rear window
8213932 it just makes you wonder why these people cant just leave things alone
8213933 its not the cost of replacing the piglets that worries me in some respect they are irreplaceable because they are already part of the production of the farm

8213942 sou a favor da lei mas acho que falta uma forma o para n s professores a respeito de como introduzir esses conte dos quando se trata de literatura africana por exemplo existem pouqu ssimos especialistas que podem falar com propriedade sobre o assunto
8213943 numa escola que fizemos um trabalho de inclus o da cultura africana notamos que mais da metade dos alunos eram negros e pardos no entanto quando observamos as bonecas feitas pela pr pria comunidade e os cartazes pendurados feitos pelos alunos e professores s apareciam brancos
8213944 o fato de ser negro e se desenhar branco um exemplo disso infelizmente o preconceito est enraizado em nossa sociedade por isso de extrema import ncia a inclus o da cultura africana nas escolas porque com a inclus o percebemos que existe uma diminui o da discrimina o e uma valoriza o da cultura por meio das hist rias de lutas de exterm nio da democracia e da religiosidade negra o sujeito que era reativo passa a ser pr ativo
8213945 um movimento sem d vida paradoxal ao mesmo tempo em que o mercado cresce e exige se mais qualidade por se tratar de empresas estrangeiras o interesse fica n tido a prioridade n o o conte do em si e sim o mercado econ mico com isso os cuidados e as exig ncias da produ o diminu ram o livro muito bonito por m pouco consistente
8213946 o mercado editorial autof gico as editoras querem gastar pouco e vender muito as ilustra es s o muito antigas e n o existe uma preocupa o em realizar novas pesquisas iconogr ficas e na iconografia os negros quase n o aparecem infelizmente em muitos livros o negro e o ndio ainda s aparecem quando se trata de quest es raciais ou como a tia anast cia sendo um coadjuvante ocupando uma profiss o desvalorizada ou representando a pobreza
8213947 tomamos muito cuidado com a quest o da diversidade existe uma preocupa o muito forte a respeito desse assunto dentro do editorial sempre procuramos colocar ilustra es n o s de negros como de pessoas com defici ncia gordinhos japoneses e de pessoas de culos nos mais diversos assuntos

8213988 kelly had already called in sick to work for radio one on sunday because she was doubled over with bad stomach pains
8213989 when she got home she reached up to get a glass of water from the cupboard to have a drink when the entire thing fell off the wall and smashed into her face
8213990 kelly had blood pouring out of a lump in her head while black and blue swelling started almost straight away around her eyes
8213991 this has been the most devastating fire weve seen in recent memory
8213992 looks like weve got to do school shopping all over again

8213994 spouses and children of people who have intimate relations with corrupt officials could be jailed for more than seven years if they are found guilty of taking advantage of such officials positions to get bribes or make money illegally
8213995 taking bribes has become a practice among some relatives and or lovers of corrupt officials
8213996 many of the corrupt officials tend to have extra marital affairs
8213997 retired officials too could face similar punishment if they use their influence in the government to make money illegally
8213998 proposes tougher penalties for officials with big assets from unidentified sources officials who cannot give the source of their assets could be jailed for up to 10 years instead of the current five years
8213999 central salford has a vibrant and diverse community and as one of the main service providers in this area we take our responsibility to reduce inequalities in the area very seriously
8214000 providing services which are accessible to all of our customers is really important to us
8214001 to get this right we need to understand their needs subsequently we want to engage with our customers in a way which suits them
8214002 pride has been great opportunity for us to reach out to a large audience and engage with our customers in a way which suits them
8214003 we have had a response to the questions we asked and will use this information to improve our services to the lgbt community
8214004 we were called at 7 30am after a worker at the recycling centre discovered the body of a newborn baby
8214005 the scene has been preserved and we are the treating the death as suspicious
8214006 the materials recycling facility will remain closed while police continue their investigation following the tragic discovery
8214007 staff remain on site and once police have concluded their work the facility will reopen
8214008 there will be no disruption to bin collections during this time
8214009 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8214010 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8214011 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8214012 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8214013 a more realistic assessment would be to consider the two factors of birth rates and immigration rates together when predicting population
8214014 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days
8214015 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged
8214016 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8214017 two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8214018 a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8214019 forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8214020 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8214021 he used to have two porsches and an aston martin and he goes shooting and fishing in his spare time
8214022 chris had just bought himself a horse which he shows and their daughter who goes to boarding school also rides
8214023 a lot of people within the group use cigarettes as a psychological support it helps them to cope with the stressful situations they deal with on a daily basis
8214024 this makes it more difficult for people with mental health issues to quit smoking because initially it causes greater anxiety levels
8214025 we also need to be careful that any nicotine replacement treatments such as patches or gum that they use do not conflict with medication they may be taking to control their health
8214026 one of the most effective things was a jar of tar showing what you absorb into your lungs from a single cigarette
8214027 people in the smoking group are getting through their illnesses but trying to stop while you are ill is very hard
8214028 this course is the extra help you need to kick the habit and improve your health
8214029 i have tried stopping before by using patches but still kept smoking
8214030 thanks to the course i can now go for longer periods without needing a cigarette i hope that by the end of the course ill have stopped completely
8214031 what can i do to pay for my blogs costs without pissing off my subscriber and reader base
8214032 we dont have numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
8214033 because of the slow growth rate of agave it is especially sensitive to the boom and bust agricultural cycle only played out in a slightly longer cycle
8214034 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
8214035 this would principally affect low quality tequila which will be altered so that it contains a lower percentage of agave
8214036 if people get more money for other crops they will stop growing agave and the price will rise its basic economics
8214037 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8214038 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8214039 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8214040 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8214041 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8214042 you look like a piece of candy i used to eat
8214043 we see work on capital improvements such as sidewalks and buildings however this project will increase the knowledge we have about employment we want to determine how many people are working with disabilities and increase that number
8214044 i can relate to others with disabilities because i am one of them i hope i can encourage others to participate in the questionnaire and the entire process
8214045 patients with a cancer diagnosis face many hospital visits either seeing their oncologist or receiving treatment
8214046 we are looking for dedicated volunteers to provide door to door transport from home to hospital
8214047 you dont need any special qualifications or experience to volunteer as a driver for our new service just access to a car and a full driving licence you dont even need a lot of spare time just one day a month would make a huge difference we will provide an induction and training programme and ongoing support
8214048 i would really encourage anyone affected by the condition to attend the meeting as it is an excellent opportunity to get more information on parkinsons at a local level
8214049 i am looking forward to the north down support group meetings because having previously belonged to the bridport branch of the pds i know how good it is to spend time with people who understand what living with parkinsons is like
8214050 if you look at what worcester are going to put out they will be a very good side
8214051 chris latham is going to play for them and it is a great opportunity for everyone in ulster to see a great player if there is no other reason to come to ravenhill come to see chris because he is one of the great full backs in world rugby
8214052 they are like us coming to the end of our pre season and gearing up for the start of a big league campaign
8214053 it will be another step up but at the same time what has been good for us is that we are seeing young players coming through who have shown us they are ready for the next step
8214054 i have been really encouraged by the players over the last few months in particular for the two pre season games their commitment and attitude has been exceptional and the worcester game will be a good test for some players who havent featured against either bath or the reds
8214055 we play scarlets next friday at ravenhill and start what we hope will be a successful league campaign so obviously a win against worcester would be a great boost for the players
8214056 i joined the ta three and a half years before i started working for my employer 18 years ago i have always been given extra days leave each year to attend annual training in addition to informal hours or days here and there for other events such as planning training weekends
8214057 in 2003 i was mobilised and sent to iraq and despite holding a very specialist post my employer released me by taking staff from another section to cover my work while i was away
8214058 my employer has offered similar support to permit me to mobilise with my regiment in two years time
8214059 catherine is a valued member of a specialist team of ecologists in effect she carries out two jobs and her commitment to both is greatly admired by colleagues
8214060 by accommodating the additional leave required to attend ta camp and events the department and her colleagues have benefited from many of the transferrable skills catherine has been able to bring back to the workplace

8214067 there are no simple right answers for most web design questions at least not for the important ones what works is good integrated design that fills a need carefully thought out well executed and tested
8214068 would not make the sdlp any more comfortable about the wider use and deployment of tasers
8214069 tasers are used by every police force in the british isles including the gardai
8214070 they have rightly been recognised as a useful and valuable tool in the fight against crime
8214071 considering the only circumstances in which tasers can be deployed is when a police officer would ordinarily have to deploy a firearm it seems truly bizarre that mark durkan should be so vociferous in his opposition to their use
8214072 would the sdlp rather that police officers were forced to use handguns in every situation where a taser should be used
8214073 the management board after careful consideration has concluded that the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns that was also economically in the best interests of the gfk shareholders
8214074 previous acquisitions in the sector have valued target companies above wpps valuation of tns
8214075 die eu weite harmonisierung der r ckstands h chstgehalte die am 1 september 2008 in kraft tritt war lange berf llig das hohe schutzniveau der verbraucher bleibt unver ndert bestehen alle jetzt harmonisierten wirkstoffe sind durch fachwissenschaftler noch einmal berpr ft und einer sicherheitsbewertung nach aktuellsten kriterien unterzogen worden man kann daher sagen dass sich das sicherheitsniveau durch die harmonisierung sogar noch erh ht erzeuger und handelsunternehmen profitieren ebenfalls weil die neuregelung endlich rechtssicherheit und transparenz innerhalb der eu herbeif hrt
8214076 es kann doch nicht sein dass ein apfel der in italien ordnungsgem angebaut wurde in sterreich ohne weiteres verkauft werden darf in deutschland aber nicht effektiver verbraucherschutz setzt voraus dass die gesetzlichen regelungen transparent sind und auch in der praxis angewandt werden k nnen
8214077 einige angebliche verbraucherschutzorganisationen behaupten dass nach der harmonisierung f r viele wirkstoffe pl tzlich viel h here h chstmengen gelten und dass dadurch die verbraucher schlechter gestellt w rden als unter der bisherigen regelung dies ist definitiv falsch
8214078 stellen sie sich vor sie m ssen auf der autobahn einen sicherheitsabstand von 100 metern zu ihrem vordermann einhalten
8214079 nach den vorsorgekriterien des r ckstandsrechts m ssten sie den hundertfachen wert also mindestens 10 kilometer als mindestabstand ansetzen
8214080 if this happens it will impact on the city leicester in all sorts of ways transport health education
8214081 what were worried about is the government is putting on a lot of pressure to make this go through for political reasons
8214082 we as an opposition group can stand separately from that and it gives us the ability to ask the hard questions the public deserves
8214083 we want to see more details from the co operative and what plans there are to minimise the impact on the city centre
8214084 weve heard talk about trams but so far all weve been promised is a small bus route which really isnt enough to make something environmentally sustainable if there are going to be a lot of people travelling between the development and the city which would undoubtedly happen
8214085 die dynamik der industrie hat sich in den vergangenen jahren sp rbar beschleunigt
8214086 weve had a number of enquiries about some of our lads
8214087 but we dont want to let anyone go we want to keep this squad together
8214088 we havent got a massive squad so we dont want to lose anyone
8214089 the enquiries have been about lads who are playing and lads who arent playing at the moment
8214090 the last thing we need is to be playing different players week in week out
8214091 we want to get a settled team and if that means extending pauls loan then hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement
8214092 hes settled in really well but we still need more from him hes done ok but we expect a lot more
8214093 hes definitely one for the future but i think hes playing at only 80 of what he can do so when he gets used to the level he will be a really good player
8214094 ideally you like to get the player in the day after the injury to get attention but we cant do that
8214095 hell get as much treatment as we can give him and hopefully he will be ok for saturday

8214109 we are moving ahead very quickly with our facilities and while at present a third ship is not on the drawing board we are running at capacity on the back haul
8214110 let me explain it this way if you have pillows arriving here in a container or some other light items and you want to send back items such as logs or aluminum ingots they are much heavier and you are unable to send the ship back with all of the containers full
8214111 we are short of space alcan rio tinto is shipping a lot of aluminum ingots through the port as well there is a lot of lumber and raw logs back moving through the port to china the shippers would like more containers to become available but the problem is the weight not the number of containers
8214112 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8214113 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8214114 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8214115 a lot of men in long kesh prison were only there because they signed a confession extracted from them under extreme circumstances in places like castlereagh and gough police detention centres
8214116 i am aware that there are a lot of people coming forward to build a case up the issue about this is that this affected republicans and loyalists and people from unionist and nationalist working class areas who were in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up spending their lives in jail
8214117 no one should deny that occasional miscarriages of justice occurred but the suggestion that hundreds of ira terrorists duly convicted were in fact innocent is preposterous
8214118 lets remember the ira murdered over 2 000 innocent people
8214119 would they now have us believe that persons other than those convicted committed those and other heinous crimes
8214120 obviously they want to have a look at tom court at loosehead and i am happy enough to play tighthead
8214121 there are a lot of guys vying for two positions and opposition is going to be incredibly fierce brendon botha is going to be coming in and he is going to bring his own dimension and his own ideas
8214122 i know clearly what i have got to do i have to get my aggression levels up i have got to be ruthless in there and get back to where i was 18 months ago where i want to hit people as hard as i can and get around the park and use my athletic ability
8214123 it was a tough year last year but i want to build again from that my job description is to hit people really hard make tackles and keep working for the team and obviously scrummaging is a massive part of that thats what i have got in my mind and it doesnt matter what side of the scrum i am on
8214124 i would be happy to work with darren and he would get the best sparring partners around
8214125 im a protege of the late great trainer eddie futch and ive worked with another great coach freddie roach so i know what im talking about
8214126 im aware that several american promoters are also anxious to talk to darren but he must be cautious
8214127 i know what it is like out there and how many sharks there are in the waters
8214128 they see dollar signs dancing before their eyes but they dont really care for the kids
8214129 our son pj was a very responsible child he knew his first day at school was coming up and he just got on with it his primary one teacher was excellent shed been teaching for years and pj still thinks of her as his favourite teacher he got eased in gently he just toddled in and was fine it was quite easy for me too because at that time i still had christopher at home to distract me christopher was different because when i went home after dropping him off there was no one there they were both eased in by going to nursery it was easy for christopher because his big brother was there and he always wanted to be like him the big boy going to school for tips i would say to the mums to have something organised to take their mind off the day a coffee with other mums or something like that is a good idea it gets better over time and after all they will be back with you by the end of the day
8214130 i was more worried than caitlin about her first day at school i was worried about being separated from her but i didnt want her to see i was nervous as that would have made her nervous we made a big outing of the whole thing had a fashion show with her in her new uniform and tried to make it as exciting as possible she was nervous on her first day but she came skipping out as shed had such a good time it turned out she knew a couple of the kids from her class so it wasnt totally strange for her i was the one in tears every time i thought of her caitlins had two first days at school because weve recently started her at an international school in majorca where well be spending a lot of our time we chose that rather than a spanish school because we wanted her to keep english as her first language it was strange because we didnt know anyone involved with the school none of the kids or mums caitlin was excited in the build up to it but on the day itself she was hiding behind my legs shes fine now and has friends in her class because there are only eight kids in each class it is a very close knit school i sent my youngest marianna to a creche in majorca because i wanted her to get used to the language she cried her eyes out when i dropped her off and picked her up on the first day but the girls there told me shed been absolutely fine the whole day for mothers who are sending their kids to school for the first time over the next few days i would advise them to make a big deal out of it and to turn it into an adventure try not to show youre nervous because they will pick up on it i think it also helps if you know kids that are going to be in the same class and have them over to play during the summer it means there will be a familiar face once they get into the classroom
8214131 the build up is really exciting for the first day at school particularly when the kids get their new uniform they look so different in that and its always over sized because they have to grow into it on bens first day we walked to school and then he just ran in and didnt look back for me there was a real sense of now what do i do you spend so much of your life with them as infants that you really dont know what to do with yourself if theyre not around and get restless waiting for home time i had a cry on the way back down the road it was a positive experience for ben though at that age theyre ready for the social side of school and the new experiences and routines of it its the start of their independent life a different thing from when theyre at a childminder or nursery because now they start learning to do things for themselves i suppose the best tip is that even if your heart is breaking you should turn it into a positive thing you need to tell them that it is going to be brilliant theyll have lots of fun and make loads of friends if youre anxious theyll pick up on it
8214132 lewis was really excited about his first day of school it was different for him because it was the school where i teach he was quite happy if a little apprehensive but i knew the best thing for me to do was to let him enjoy it on his own he was able to meet his friends from nursery and him having been there meant that he had developed his social skills a little and wasnt as dependent on me i was the one who was emotional i found it very hard my classroom was downstairs from his and i kept an ear out in case there was a knock on the door because he wasnt settling in i did go and talk to his teacher at breaktime which made me feel more at ease ellie will start nursery this year which eases you in you bring them in for an hour at the start and then stay with them shes a bit more confident than lewis and will take things in her stride a good tip is to encourage children to socialise over the summer have lots of playdates so theyll make friends in their class and get used to interacting with other kids its also important to talk about it show them the building even take a tour if its possible turn it into an adventure and make a big deal of picking out things like pencil cases and school bags mums should trust the p1 teacher it can be difficult if they dont know them that well but they do know what theyre doing its also a good chance to meet some of the other mums on the first day and go for a coffee
8214133 the current economic climate presents a challenge to all media companies throughout the world it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media

8214152 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8214153 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8214154 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8214155 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8214156 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8214165 the president of russia is ready for confrontation with the west
8214166 is a bomb set between russia and the wests relations for many years to come
8214167 if our partners want good relations with russia they will understand the reason for our decision and things will be calm but if they choose confrontation well we have lived under such conditions and we can do so again
8214168 russia does not count on wide support for its initiative
8214169 formal recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is the fulfilment of a moral and political obligation to them no more no less
8214170 it is rather curious if one remembers that less than one month ago the kremlin actively spoke of the need to build a new system of european security and to conclude a new partnership agreement with europe
8214171 as europe we are ten times richer than russia and along with the united states twenty times
8214172 id prefer if russia worked together and integrated itself with the wider known west but if it comes to confrontation then it will lose again
8214173 heads of france germany the us turkey and ukraine have been in russia
8214174 poland shouldnt be the only nation that doesnt speak with its neighbour i think that russia should also care for dialogue with a nation thats now listened to on eastern matters more carefully than ever before
8214175 i am asking the pad and demonstrators to withdraw from government house peacefully
8214176 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant
8214177 the pad protests have cost a lot of resources and energy over the past three months and now they are running out of both

8214180 memberikan jawatan timbalan perdana menteri kepada husam setelah dilantik sebagai senator apabila kerajaan persekutuan yang baru dibentuk oleh pakatan rakyat pada 16 september nanti
8214181 pertemuan pas umno itu adalah ancaman besar buat anwar dan husam maka mereka merancang supaya sebarang usaha mempertemukan pas dan umno akan gagal sama sekali di masa hadapan
8214182 maka bersungguh sungguhlah mereka secara sedar mahupun tanpa disedari mempertikaikan dan menyanggah keputusan majlis syura ulama pas yang mengizinkan presiden dan timbalannya mengadakan pertemuan dengan umno
8214183 manakala tugas terpenting buat husam ialah untuk mempengaruhi tok guru mursyidul am datuk nik abdul aziz nik mat supaya beliau juga tidak bersetuju dengan sebarang bentuk pertemuan di antara pas dan umno
8214184 sebab itulah kita melihat tok guru kita seringkali membuat kenyataan yang agak bercanggah dengan tuan guru presiden dan majlis syura
8214185 cubalah kita bayangkan betapa rendahnya martabat tuan guru presiden menurut kaca mata khalid sehingga di aku engkau kan
8214186 kalimah aku kadang kadang saya gunakan semasa bergurau dengan sahabat handai tetapi tidak sekali kali semasa bercakap dengan mereka engkau saya tidak pernah pakai dan sebaliknya menggunakan awak secara kebiasaan
8214187 dalam mesyuarat adakalanya saya menyanggah pandangan dr dzulkifli adakalanya pandangan husam dan juga sebaliknya itu perkara biasa bagi kami kita ingin mencari keputusan yang terbaik
8214188 saya tahu apa yang berlaku namun saya merasakan masalah yang kita sedang hadapi dalam pakatan rakyat adalah perkara biasa
8214189 kita tahu adabul ikhtilaf dan tidak membodohkan satu sama lain
8214190 sebenarnya peruntukan untuk pas diisi oleh orang pas ada pula peruntukan untuk ngo dan profesional ang yang saya cadangkan adalah pengerusi persatuan penduduk taman berkeley saya cadangkan nama beliau untuk mengisi peruntukan ngo
8214191 amat berjasa kepada pas kerana berkerja keras untuk pas semasa pilihanraya umum 1999 hingga 2008
8214192 sebenarnya zulkifli dan chong bertelagah hasil jolokan umno bn isu asal berhubung bahasa kebangsaan dan islam sebagai agama rasmi sengaja dikaitkan kepada forum majlis peguam
8214193 saya masuk untuk menghentikan perbalahan di antara dua wakil pakatan rakyat dengan membawa perbahasan kembali kepada isu asal iaitu bahasa kebangsaan dan islam sebagai agama rasmi
8214194 kalau ada masa dan setelah mendapat bukti yang cukup saya akan bongkarkan penyelewengan yang beliau lakukan dalam menguruskan kewangan pas
8214195 atau datuk kamaruddin hanya perlu menerima arahan daripada bos lama datuk iaitu anwar dan husam musa sahaja
8214196 ataupun datuk dah cukup besar kepala nak langkah bendul mendahului presiden dan timbalan presiden pas dan cuba menyelesai dan memadam kemelut pas pulau pinang ini dengan cara datuk sendiri

8214228 in december the attack on the christian community was confined to kandhamal district but it has now spread to all districts the attackers are systematically targeting the christians as compared to the december attacks of last year when they targeted the church property and buildings they are targeting our priests nuns and others working in the churches

8214236 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8214237 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8214276 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8214277 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8214312 ornithologists now use mist nets these nearly invisible nets are set up like fences and function as huge spider webs catching unsuspecting birds the researcher carefully extracts the bird from the net each bird is measured aged sexed and banded with an individually numbered anklet then the bird is released i photographed these birds while they are caught in mist nets moments before the ornithologist extracts them here the birds inhabit a fascinating space between our framework of the bush and the hand it is a fragile and embarrassing moment before they disappear back into the woods and into data

8214319 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8214320 consumers in mature markets continued to favour mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation despite this we remain positive that mobile phone sales in 2008 will reach 1 28 billion units
8214321 we expect samsungs sales to remain strong in the second half of 2008 as new products such as the omnia pick up momentum
8214322 our confidence in an improved performance by sony ericsson weakened further as recent product announcements were disappointing since they delivered similar current features and designs
8214323 net new cellular connections declined significantly operators added more than 83 million connections in the first quarter of 2008 but they added only 75 million in the second quarter of 2008 this drop negatively impacted sales of mobile devices in the second quarter of 2008
8214324 in addition high food prices and inflation also had a negative impact on sales of replacement mobile handsets
8214325 the economy in several countries has slowed down and the region saw slower than expected replacement sales as consumers dealt with the higher cost of living despite these unfavourable conditions operators and handset vendors continue to target areas with low penetration in the commonwealth of independent states and west africa
8214326 this drop is twice as much as last quarter and it was the result of a lack of new phone features that were compelling enough to drive growth
8214327 the performance this quarter was below expectations mainly due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 and slightly weaker demand in the second quarter of 2008 generating higher levels of inventory as vendors did not fully materialise sales
8214328 despite industry concerns over the economic downturn handset sales were strong up 5 3 quarter on quarter
8214329 new subscribers were limited during the quarter as growth continued to be dominated by replacement sales
8214330 however the market was up 16 per cent quarter on quarter the region reached a penetration rate of 121 5 per cent in the first half of 2008 demonstrating that there is a strong dependence on replacement sales as a driver in this market
8214331 economic conditions remained challenging during the quarter although some vendors and operators felt this more than others with sony ericsson continuing to feel the strain and vodafone sales being affected by delays in new devices availability and slower replacement sales
8214332 we expect mobile handset sales to exhibit 11 per cent growth in 2008 and the growth in revenue will be slightly lower at 9 per cent as increased competition and a tougher economic environment negatively impact average selling prices in addition mobile phone manufacturers will be put under pressure to maintain healthy margins while they intend to further break through the emerging markets to increase sales

8214335 we sure had a great fourth especially after we picked up our morning papers and found that congress had adjourned the night of the third

8214353 ein blick auf die letztj hrigen ergebnisse zeigt dass sich die megatrends mehr oder weniger unver ndert fortsetzen bei der generellen entwicklung der sportrechte f r die saison 2008 2009 genauso wie in den bereichen internet und mobile als ma gebliche vermarktungskan le der zukunft allerdings gibt es auch ver nderungen so sind die experten im hinblick auf die tv vermarktung der deutschen handball liga nicht mehr ganz so optimistisch wie noch im letzten jahr
8214354 betrachtet man die zahlen ber alle vermarktungssegmente und sportarten hinweg so zeigen sich vor allem zwei tendenzen fu ball und handball sind nach wie vor die sportarten mit den gr ten potenzialen die einsch tzungen f r eishockey und basketball sind dagegen eher zur ckhaltend insbesondere beim fu ball mit abstrichen auch beim handball sieht es sowohl bei der hospitality tv als auch der internet und mobile vermarktung gut aus vergleicht man die prognosen von 2008 und 2007 so ist jedoch eine gewisse ern chterung festzustellen das gilt insbesondere f r den handball wo der enthusiasmus seit gewinn der weltmeisterschaft beim publikum etwas nachgelassen zu haben scheint entsprechend vorsichtiger sind dann auch die experten in ihren erwartungen

8214390 estoy contento por esta idea asegur ortelli no estoy compitiendo en top race para poder dedicarle un tiempo a mi familia pero la categor a me encanta y siempre hablo bien de ella
8214391 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8214392 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8214393 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8214394 no one has even come close to this i suspect no one else ever will
8214395 he soon became not just donald bradman but the don
8214396 in the tough years of the depression he was a hero at home and a great source of national pride in difficult times
8214397 he is our clark kent the mild mannered ordinary man who contains and conceals immeasurable powers is always there when needed and always delivers the goods but with nobility of purpose
8214398 something to watch not only a great batsman but a marvellous fieldsman too

8214404 today marks the beginning of a positive change as we work to improve the health care of every georgian
8214405 we have a poor mental health system a poor child welfare system a poor public health system
8214406 reorganizing in and of itself isnt going to solve the problem resources matter the political will matters a restructuring without resources doesnt make any sense
8214407 its like rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic if you dont have the funding its going to sink
8214408 to ensure that our citizens are getting the best value for our investment while providing the best services
8214409 but i believe this is an appropriate next step creating an agency with a singular mission for mental health
8214410 we have reached the bottom of the barrel with mental health
8214411 were not creating more government i think youll get a truer picture of whats going on in mental health
8214412 the number of cases referred from law enforcement in years past was much smaller
8214413 dr guntermann gesellschaft f r kommunikation management und journalismus mbh
8214414 the typical household income in georgia hasnt improved since 2001 when taking inflation into account
8214415 we need to remember that people who lack health insurance tend to have unmet health needs
8214416 when they do show up at the hospital they are treated for their illness and we all pay for that through higher prices and higher insurance premiums
8214417 this gives me strength and courage to knock on doors
8214418 poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth
8214419 given that the overall airfare is up 11 percent and will likely increase around peak dates travelers have to find good values to make up the difference
8214420 buying packages and looking for hotel deals where the hotel cost can help offset the increased flight price is critical
8214421 based on the current climate its more important than ever to be a savvy traveler and use all the tools available to make sure your travel plans arent ruined by a schedule change missed connection or lost luggage
8214422 july u s lodging industry performance came in as it was anticipated
8214423 occupancy declined due primarily to continued supply growth but room demand room nights sold actually increased slightly total industry revpar inched ahead 0 4 percent but the largest 25 markets experienced 2 1 percent growth driven by new york houston san francisco and dc
8214424 during the credit crunch timeshare represents increasingly good holiday value and although many brits may be forced to cut back group rci members can rest assured that they have budgeted in advance for a well earned holiday in addition our members can choose breaks from a wide portfolio of holiday properties such as lakeside retreats in finland a spa hotel in the uk or perhaps a beach resort in florida
8214425 we all want a holiday to look forward to this survey from rci suggests that british travellers are cutting back on the number of short breaks they take lets face it cheap flights have made us positively promiscuous when it comes to going abroad it looks as though we may be re focussing on a solid week or two away which means that more people will be considering timeshare and shared ownership products

8214430 absolutely there are always risks as the conflict is very close to ukraine and we have to show adequate vigilance in this regard and preclude any possible provocative actions as regards ukraine
8214431 i wont draw parallels here as these are absolutely different things ukraine is an independent free peace loving country which will never resort to any aggressive means crimea is an integral part of an independent ukraine
8214432 you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8214433 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8214434 when you see sales begin to increase thats often an indicator of a market turning
8214435 not to say that there arent some shoes that are going to drop there but the rate of change is a lot different
8214436 people are saying the reason prices are falling are because of all of the foreclosures but the foreclosures are happening because the prices are falling
8214437 theyve got it backwards the prices are falling because theyre too freakin high
8214438 there seems to be no understanding of the toxic nature of this inventory
8214439 an inventory dominated by lender sellers a very motivated group of sellers means prices will be driven down hard private sellers with insufficient equity who have to sell in this environment will have no option but to apply for a short sale or be foreclosed upon
8214440 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8214441 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president george w bush 95 of the time
8214442 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8214443 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8214444 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8214445 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8214446 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8214447 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8214448 my boys were just an arms length behind me as we were walking along i heard someone say get out of my way move before i turned around to see her almost hitting lucas without even giving him the chance to move to the side
8214449 she swerved and ran into brendan at full speed he was on the front of the scooter then he fell off and she ran over his legs
8214450 they got caught up and he was dragged along the floor but she just carried on for several metres before running over his legs again
8214451 its a miracle that nothing was broken really but brendan is still in shock and so am i especially because she didnt say sorry or anything
8214452 police were called to reports of a collision between a five year old boy and a mobility scooter
8214453 inquiries are continuing no one has been questioned or arrested
8214454 spiralen av provokationer m ste upph ra och det omedelbart annars kan vi f rlora kontrollen ver situationen snabbare n vi anar
8214455 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8214456 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8214457 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8214458 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8214459 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8214460 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8214461 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8214462 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8214463 f sica e mentalmente estamos no topo o meu sonho ganhar a uefa champions league e espero que tal aconte a em breve
8214464 jog mos muito bem em turim mas os quatro golos apontados tiraram nos alguma motiva o
8214465 tent mos ganhar o jogo mas n o conseguimos no entanto no final cumprimos o objectivo e sentimo nos satisfeitos por isso j estamos na fase de grupos pelo que temos agora de nos concentrar no campeonato italiano e no jogo contra a acf fiorentina
8214466 when we make decisions about how elections are run we all need to think about the voters interests above all else elections are the opportunity for citizens to take part in the democratic process and have their say about how we are governed and the services we receive
8214467 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and coordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain
8214468 clearly articulating electoral policy rather than micro managing the delivery of elections
8214469 our proposal is designed to allow local returning officers to continue to respond to local circumstances while ensuring that there is a consistently high standard of service for all electors across the uk
8214470 first major victory in the battle for the integrity of universities
8214471 of late uclan has been the subject of many attacks by the anti homeopathy league
8214472 colquhoun et al have kept the university lawyers and us quite fruitlessly busy by making claims for very detailed course information under the freedom of information act
8214473 the relentless attacks have taken their toll and it appears that they the critics have won this small victory
8214474 the university continues to be supportive of us and our efforts
8214475 fortunately our masters course is thriving and we have been asked to focus upon this area and homeopathy research for the time being
8214476 i see it as a victory for the integrity of universities if uclan wants to get that sort of reputation thats its own problem but the trouble is that the whole university system and science gets tarred with it it adds to a distrust of universities and science
8214477 if universities condone this voodoo and nonsense whats the impression that gives of universities
8214478 a lot of people wouldnt distinguish between uclan and ucl im not terribly snobbish about post 92 universities there are good people there but it saddens me to see them doing this to themselves voluntarily
8214479 its very short term for bums on seats to destroy their reputation as sensible academic places
8214480 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8214481 the two hijackers and seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8214482 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8214483 we dont support putting the lives of sudanese civilians at risk in any circumstances
8214484 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8214485 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8214486 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8214487 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8214488 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8214489 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8214490 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8214491 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8214492 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8214493 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8214494 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8214495 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8214496 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8214497 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8214498 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8214499 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8214500 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8214501 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8214502 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8214503 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8214504 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8214505 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8214506 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8214507 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8214508 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8214509 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8214510 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8214511 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8214512 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8214513 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8214514 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8214515 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8214516 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8214517 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8214518 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8214519 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8214520 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8214521 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8214522 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8214523 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8214524 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8214525 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8214526 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8214527 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8214528 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8214529 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8214530 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8214531 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8214532 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8214533 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8214534 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8214535 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8214536 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8214537 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8214538 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8214539 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8214540 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8214541 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8214542 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8214543 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8214544 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8214545 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8214546 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8214547 i think if someone like john mccain for example has very fair skin light eyes and a history of living in a place like arizona that is a darn good explanation for his skin cancers and he is healthy otherwise so the chances of his non melanoma skin cancers being a marker for other dna repair problems is slim in my opinion
8214548 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8214549 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8214550 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8214551 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8214552 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8214553 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8214554 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8214555 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8214556 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8214557 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8214558 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8214559 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8214560 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8214561 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8214562 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8214563 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8214564 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8214565 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8214566 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8214567 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8214568 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8214569 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8214570 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8214571 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8214572 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8214573 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8214574 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8214575 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8214576 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8214577 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8214578 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8214579 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8214580 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8214581 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8214582 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8214583 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8214584 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8214585 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8214586 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8214587 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8214588 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8214589 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8214590 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8214591 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8214592 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8214593 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8214594 its like jen is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jen shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8214595 jen was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartar rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine
8214596 este n o foi um conflito que escolhemos n o temos interesse no territ rio georgiano
8214597 ele acreditava que a r ssia ficaria parada enquanto suas tropas de paz disparavam contra os camaradas russos na oss tia do sul
8214598 nossas tropas entraram na ge rgia para destruir bases usadas para o ataque e depois deixaram o pa s restabelecemos a paz mas n o conseguimos acalmar os temores e aspira es dos moradores da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia
8214599 poss vel imaginar o que foi para os abkhazes ver fechada sua universidade de sujumi pelo governo de tbilisi sob o argumento de que supostamente n o tinham uma l ngua adequada ou uma hist ria ou cultura e por isso n o precisavam de uma universidade
8214600 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8214601 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8214602 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8214603 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8214604 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8214605 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8214606 even our most talented students academically have said this is a really long test
8214607 now they are taking it once and then they are taking the act
8214608 the act folks have done a wonderful job of marketing their product to the mid atlantic colleges
8214609 we want to make sure we do all the preparation work
8214610 i suspect it is an urban myth that the act is easier they are all college prep tests
8214611 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8214612 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8214613 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8214614 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8214615 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8214616 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8214617 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8214618 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8214619 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8214620 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8214621 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8214622 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8214623 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8214624 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8214625 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8214626 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8214627 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8214628 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8214629 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8214630 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8214631 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8214632 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8214633 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8214634 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8214635 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8214636 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8214637 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8214638 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8214639 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8214640 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8214641 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8214642 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8214643 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8214644 n o h um est dio em situa o perfeita nem mesmo o engenh o localizado no rio e constru do para o pan rio 2007
8214645 o engenh o uma p rola no meio de um lugar deteriorado de p ssima qualidade
8214646 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8214647 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8214648 my plans are to be a board member that is very interactive at the actual school building level and begins an immediate cooperation with all teachers
8214649 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8214650 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8214651 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8214652 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8214653 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8214654 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8214655 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8214656 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8214657 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8214658 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8214659 tropical depression lawin is expected to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rains over the western section of luzon which may trigger flashfloods and landslides
8214660 if the fighting will continue for every civilian killed we will execute 10 moro rebels
8214661 the civilians are suffering now thats why we are asking the leadership of the milf to stop its harassment and attacks in mindanao because it will only complicate the life of the people
8214662 mindanao is not only for the muslims but for christians and lumad as well because we are the ones that form the tri people group the owner s of mindanao
8214663 we need to unite muslims christians and lumad and my message to the muslim civilians is dont admire what the milf group is doing because it will only destroy the development in the region
8214664 we must shun the leadership of the milf they are the ones that destroy our life look at what is happening around you many civilians have been affected
8214665 we are for arming civilians in areas targeted by milf for them to defend their families and properties
8214666 to our followers dont be afraid i am asking those who will join in the future to strictly follow our constitution
8214667 those amulets of my men came from their elders during the time of commander toothpick
8214668 our instruction to them is not to go to battle if they have done something wrong against other people to follow gods commandments to avoid accidents that may lead to their deaths
8214669 we will let the authorities hunt them with the bounty for their arrest their followers will hand them to the authorities
8214670 we gave a one week warning against kato and bravo before to stop launching attacks we are happy that they listened to us but if they launch attacks again we will fight
8214671 after the fighting broke out they approached us and asked if we can help
8214672 our warfare style is not offensive but defensive i think the situation will not get worse but if the milf will launch other attacks we are ready to fight
8214673 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8214674 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8214675 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8214676 the ridership capacity of the lrta lines is unprecedented it is in fact the biggest riding capacity
8214677 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8214678 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8214679 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8214680 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8214681 providing access to improved health and wellness with compassion and respect for all
8214682 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8214683 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8214684 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8214685 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8214686 a ttacks such as these are damaging not just to anino and its staff but to the entire philippine creative and outsourcing industry in general
8214687 the meeting could either be here or in kuala lumpur
8214688 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8214689 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8214690 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8214691 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8214692 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8214693 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8214694 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
8214695 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
8214696 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
8214697 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
8214698 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
8214699 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
8214700 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
8214701 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
8214702 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
8214703 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
8214704 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
8214705 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
8214706 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
8214707 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
8214708 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
8214709 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
8214710 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
8214711 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
8214712 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
8214713 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
8214714 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
8214715 we are thrilled that alaskan voters have spoken and they have made it clear that mining is part of our history in the state and part of our future
8214716 create solar solutions that improve the quality of life for all human kind
8214717 bring order and simplicity to the chaos which is the current solar power business
8214718 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico
8214719 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico
8214720 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8214721 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8214722 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8214723 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8214724 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8214725 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8214726 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8214727 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8214728 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8214729 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8214730 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8214731 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8214732 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8214733 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8214734 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8214735 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8214736 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8214737 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8214738 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8214739 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8214740 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8214741 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8214742 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8214743 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8214744 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8214745 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8214746 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8214747 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8214748 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8214749 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8214750 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8214751 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8214752 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8214753 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8214754 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8214755 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8214756 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8214757 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8214758 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8214759 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8214760 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8214761 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8214762 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8214763 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8214764 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8214765 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8214766 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8214767 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8214768 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8214769 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8214770 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8214771 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8214772 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8214773 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8214774 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8214775 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8214776 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8214777 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8214778 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8214779 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8214780 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8214781 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8214782 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8214785 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8214786 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8214787 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8214788 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8214789 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8214790 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8214791 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8214792 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8214793 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8214794 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8214795 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8214796 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8214797 are a bad reflection on him as a human being

8214800 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8214801 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8214802 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8214803 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8214804 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8214805 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8214806 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8214807 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8214808 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8214809 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8214810 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8214811 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8214812 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8214813 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8214814 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8214815 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8214816 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8214817 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8214818 maar verder mogen we nauwelijks speculeren over de vraag wat er nu misging het zijn allemaal nog hypotheses
8214819 het is een structureel antwoord op de vergrijzing en maatschappelijke problemen als langdurige werkloosheid
8214820 mijn generatie vrouwen en zeker de generatie boven mij heeft nooit geleerd te verliezen
8214821 maar ik denk steeds jullie willen gewoon niet zien dat je verloren hebt
8214822 weer zo eentje met een te kort geheugen rara hoe kan dat toch
8214823 als zulke zaken naar buiten komen dan hebben de hoofdrolspelers altijd last van altheimer
8214824 het onderwijs in nederland is kennelijk zo afgetakeld dat politici zelfs hun eigen naam niet meer correct kunnen schrijven
8214825 toch heel kwalijk hoor als men niet meer weet wat men in het verleden heeft ondertekend zeker gekeken naar wijnand duyvendak ook hier geldt aftreden middels dwang of misschien eleganter zelf aftreden zonder wachtgeld
8214826 ik begreep ze niet dus heb ik ze voorgelegd aan een andere uitgever die er w l verstand van heeft daar werd annemarie kwaad over want alle medewerkers ontvingen een e mail waarin stond we stoppen
8214827 ik was verbijsterd toen ik het weer in de winkel zag liggen
8214828 van gaal had het contract van de columnisten opgezegd dus ik wist niet beter dat het zou stoppen later had ze het nog wel over een andere naam voor het blad maar ik heb niets meer gehoord ok dan kappen we er mee dacht ik tot ik het blad weer zag liggen
8214829 ze kiest er z lf voor niet op de hoogte te zijn wij sturen haar van alles maar ze reageert niet
8214830 it would irritate me but theres nothing i could do about it

8214840 keluarga di sana lebih tahu mana korma yang bagus dan tidak jadi bisa dibilang saya tidak pernah dapat kiriman korma yang jelek atau rusak
8214841 setiap bulan saya bisa menjual hingga 15 000 ribu dus
8214842 tapi itu urusan mereka kalau saya sih selalu menjual yang asli dan tidak pernah menutupi kualitas korma yang dipilih pembeli kalau jelek saya bilang jelek justru itu yang membuat pembeli selalu kembali pokoknya di sini semuanya halal
8214843 kilauan itu biasanya hasil manipulasi dari minyak zaitun yang dioleskan si penjual
8214844 kalau yang paling mahal korma nabi agwa dan sokari harganya bisa rp 200 ribu hingga rp ribu per kilo
8214845 panen kormanya terlambat gara gara itu harga juga tidak stabil sekarang ini setiap dua hari sekali harganya naik antara rp 5000 sampai 10 ribu
8214846 tapi akhirnya tetap beli karena di tempat lain lebih mahal
8214847 saya pernah tinggal di dubai selama 4 tahun ikut suami yang kerja di sana
8214848 saya pikir di indonesia belum ada toko khusus menjual korma seperti ini kalau di sana sih sudah lazim cuma waktu itu belum yakin
8214849 jenis jenis ini tidak mengenal musim selalu berbuah sepanjang tahun nah kemudian saya sesuaikan dengan selera orang indonesia
8214850 di indonesia tidak disukai misalnya korma sokari yang sangat keras untuk jalan tengahnya saya ambil juga tapi yang jenis lembut
8214851 orang bilang tekstur korma kholas seperti durian manisnya juga seperti ada karamelnya
8214852 rhutab adalah korma yang sudah dipetik atau dipanen ketika masih setengah matang sesudah dipanen langsung dimasukkan ke freezer supaya kadar air dan proses kemanisannya berhenti sebetulnya semua jenis korma bisa dijadikan rhutab
8214853 kuncinya hanya menjaga temperatur enggak ada yang pakai bahan pengawet kalau temperatur terjaga kualitasnya akan tetap bagus korma bisa tahan setahun jika disimpan di suhu 6 10 derajat celcius

8214857 ada 5 alasan pertama prt biasanya perempuan tidak bisa dipungkiri perempuan masih dipandang warga kelas dua di masyarakat
8214858 yang namanya pembantu kebanyakan tidak sekolah keempat mereka dari kalangan ekonomi lemah dan yang terakhir kodrat mereka berhadapan dengan orang yang superior yaitu majikannya sehingga mempertegas posisi mereka yang inferior
8214859 sebenarnya yang paling jadi prioritas adalah kesadaran dari instansi terkait misalnya depnaker untuk membangun aturan main atau kebijakan yang ditujukan untuk melindungi orang orang yang bekerja di sektor informal seperti prt
8214860 juga harus ada kerja sama yang terintegrasi misalnya dengan departemen sosial dengan polri
8214861 perlu menumbuhkan kesadaran di kalangan masyarakat bahwa sesungguhnya keamanan ketertiban dan kedamaian tanggung jawab terbesarnya ada pada masyarakat itu sendiri begitu masyarakat menangkap tanda tanda kekerasan semestinya bertindak lebih dulu
8214862 misalnya kenapa pembantu itu tidak pernah keluar rumah itu sudah kejanggalan cuma masalahnya sejauh mana masyarakat mau peduli apalagi masyarakat perkotaan
8214863 majikan yang menganiaya prt tak lepas dari hukum mereka harus mempertanggungjawabkan perbuatannya
8214864 dengan begitu akan memberi efek jera terhadap majikan yang melakukan penganiayaan terhadap prt dia juga jadi sadar tidak kebal hukum
8214865 kami sekeluarga tidak mengerti kenapa majikan tarsini begitu kejam tarsini bukan hewan yang bisa dengan enaknya dipukuli
8214866 cara terbaik mengajarkan dan memotivasi anak berpuasa memang jangan memerintah tapi harus menginspirasinya

8214875 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour they are also classic excuses for risky and damaging behaviour
8214876 even with children we need more of a mary poppins than a miss trunchbull
8214877 the initiatives drift why because this is a government even more obsessed with the short term when what public health requires is a commitment to action now and real follow through even if the benefits accrue over the longer term
8214878 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
8214879 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
8214880 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8214881 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
8214882 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction

8214888 wenn wir wollen dass das n chste spiel im wald von s damerika spielt k nnten wir es tun
8214889 aber ich denke die zeitersparnis war f r uns einer der gr nde warum wir das afrika setting w hlten wir f hlten dass ein exotischer und gef hrlicher schauplatz den die meisten leute wahrscheinlich noch nie selbst erlebt oder ausf hrlich in film fernsehen und anderen spielen gesehen haben den wert der far cry marke bewahrt deswegen wollten wir afrika nehmen

8215002 this has been one of the most significant areas of claim this 2008 holiday season this case is typical and reflects a total disregard and respect for this paying customer and his consumer rights the government and the eu commission must get to grips with this issue the travel industry is riding roughshod over ordinary consumers
8215003 i think there are some clinton supporters who are very upset over the hillary thing
8215004 i think when hillary speaks she will probably explain to them that she appreciates their support i have talked to her and told her she has my support any time in the future when she wants to do something but it isnt this time we should all support the democrat ticket for president and vice president

8215006 while it is difficult to forecast advertising revenues reliably for the second half as we have only experienced the two traditionally quiet summer months trading in the next three months leading up to christmas will be critical in determining the full year result
8215007 however as second half comparators are easier and assuming a continuation of the first half advertising trends inm believes that it will achieve profits in line with consensus forecasts for the full year
8215008 it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media

8215020 we had a real good quarterback last year so i think playing receiver helped the team most last year
8215021 and whats going to help the team most this year is me playing quarterback

8215034 opening games are always tricky because you have to make sure you have all of your players in the right places
8215035 good afternoon we are preparing for our first game here against fiu it is a team that we have respect for i think that their coach mario cristobal is doing a great job there because we have played them before we have followed their program very closely all indications are that they are a highly disciplined team they are well coached and well organized they have recruited well and they have some talented players that are veteran players we are looking forward to playing them we think they are going to be a much different team than they were a year ago in terms of growth and maturity they have a new offensive coordinator who will spread the field and get the ball around pretty good on defense they are talented they have some players who could play for anybody they have a corner named anthony gator who is a good cover guy he is a smart and speedy guy who also plays special teams at safety they have jeremiah wright who is a very talented player he runs extremely well they have a couple of huge defensive tackles on the offensive side of the ball they have two quarterbacks who are battling it out last year wayne younger played against us but they won their last game of the year with paul mccall i think they both bring something to the table and we have to prepare for both of them i think it will be a good challenge opening games are always tricky because you have to make sure you have all of your players in the right places we are looking forward to it we have had good preparation and we will continue to have good preparation this week and we will be ready to go
8215036 after watching their tape from last year we have to take into consideration that their offense has changed we know the background of their new offensive coordinator they are going to spread the field and they are going to be a lot like purdue in a lot of ways they are going to try and attack the field horizontally once you tighten up your coverage they are going to run the ball they like to run the zone play and dig you out inside with good combo blocks and a vertical push we know to a degree what they will do on offense but we dont know completely since we havent seen their offense since they have made a change in coordinators
8215037 we only put out a depth chart because there is a public demand for it it can change before the ink dries on it jake sharp is a veteran guy who knows the system he knows what to expect jacques crawford is new with us and he is still learning he is going to play and he is going to get a lot of carries based on maturity dependability and understanding the offense right now we feel like jake sharp can carry that load as a starter but jacques will play a significant amount
8215038 im teaching more basic things than last year things that a lot of the players might have already known
8215039 but theyre catching on theyre a good group theyre athletic and hardworking
8215040 last year we were able to rely on those guys dul and marchuk

8215071 until i get them out on the field im not sure what formations i can play
8215072 i just have to see what i have in order to see what type of formation im going to play
8215073 i think its going to be an amazing season and i think were going to be a tight unit and were going to connect with coach pollaro
8215074 i think we have good players who are ready and standing by and i think well be more of an attacking team
8215075 they know how i coach they know my personality now its just they have to trust me in the sense of leading the team

8215092 but we dont want to let anyone go we want to keep this squad together
8215093 we havent got a massive squad so we dont want to lose anyone
8215094 the enquiries have been about lads who are playing and lads who arent playing at the moment
8215095 the last thing we need is to be playing different players week in week out
8215096 we want to get a settled team and if that means extending pauls loan then hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement
8215097 hes settled in really well but we still need more from him hes done ok but we expect a lot more
8215098 hes definitely one for the future but i think hes playing at only 80 of what he can do so when he gets used to the level he will be a really good player
8215099 ideally you like to get the player in the day after the injury to get attention but we cant do that
8215100 hell get as much treatment as we can give him and hopefully he will be ok for saturday

8215140 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8215141 we are developing fast as a nation our economy is growing and we need to know how to handle these changes we need to know how to handle our money how to handle the things we own we can only do that using the bible as our guide
8215142 we cannot catch up with the growth of the quantity of the believers
8215143 churches in the countryside are growing so fast yet they cannot afford to send a pastor for training to the city it is too expensive
8215144 so we try to help them by sponsoring their education but even after they graduate from seminary they go back to the countryside where they often serve in their churches without pay
8215145 we have students in beijing hong kong taiwan the ukraine malaysia australia the united states and canada all taking these courses in mandarin said dr

8215147 every year we lose about 10 percent of our candidates
8215148 they leave for other jobs the rest stay knowing that this is part of their calling but we have got to do more to keep those pastors from leaving
8215149 we have to provide them good housing good medical care and good insurance
8215150 pastors dont make a lot of money they make much lower than the average wage and so it is difficult for them to survive financially

8215155 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters

8215157 the dsm monitors are a logical next step as we expand our position as a leader in the studio monitor market

8215159 after reading the feedback in the article forums i noticed quite a few recommendations for the mackie onyx 1640 mixer it has 16 mic preamps and all of the other features you would expect from analog mixer you can also use two of the channels for a direct guitar input via the hi z input
8215160 the hi z input is perfect for what im looking for because its designed specifically for guitars allowing me to plug directly into the mixer
8215161 the mixer also has an internal talkback function another handy thing that you dont necessarily think about until you have a group of people standing around with headphones on recording some music
8215162 in every mode it excels it sounds natural and authoritative almost valve like in the mid and the treble sublimely well made its an absolute joy to use it does what it should without dramas it is truly the swiss army knife of hi fi

8215175 a method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document such as one page regardless of whether the zoom is such that some all or one page is currently being viewed in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row

8215179 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8215180 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8215181 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8215182 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8215183 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8215184 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8215185 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years
8215186 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8215187 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8215188 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8215189 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8215190 i honestly didnt think i had a chance dont get me wrong i wanted to do good to do everyone proud to at least look decent on youtube
8215191 the effect of the prevailing macro economic environment has been a vast detriment to a host of companies and as a result of the aforementioned conditions along with other market variables we find our own share value at its lowest levels despite these conditions we have maintained our operational integrity while simultaneously feeding our growth requirements and engaging new prospects we are continually seeing opportunities for growth but we must maintain a stringent diligence in order to manage the delicate balance of financing that growth while maintaining a strict adherence to shareholder value it is our belief that becoming a reporting company and trading on a larger more prominent exchange will provide the liquidity and the breadth to achieve this aim we have already implemented the beginning stages of this process and will be making future announcements pertaining to our progress
8215192 we also look forward to making future announcements relating to additional retail locations for our existing clientele
8215193 we are very pleased with this investment by our strategic alliance partner glg plans to use these funds in the development of its greenfield facilities that are currently under construction and on schedule for production in the fourth quarter this year
8215194 we pride ourselves on delivering personalized patient care second to none
8215195 we believe the tone is set with the patients very first call and in a medical situation people will always be more comfortable dealing with a person thats why reaching a person right up front rather than a recorded message is so very important providing superior personalized service and fostering enduring patient relationships is one of our core strategies
8215196 no environment is more critical than healthcare when it comes to making sure calls are handled promptly efficiently and with personal care and attention
8215197 weve designed a solution for carolinas healthcare with this absolute priority top of mind
8215198 our high grade minto copper gold mine continues to generate strong financial results
8215199 recognizing that there is an approximate three month lag between metal production and the related financial return we generated cash flow from mining operations i of 21 4 million in the second quarter and 38 3 million in the first six months of 2008 given that copper production totalled 12 8 million pounds in the second quarter and that there will be two concentrate shipments in the third quarter as compared to one in each of the first two quarters we are well positioned to deliver a strong set of third quarter results
8215200 going forward we expect to achieve our objective of 55 million pounds of copper production in 2008 and to benefit from 1 lower unit operating costs as mill throughput is sustained at or above design levels 2 head grades increase into the fourth quarter as fresh high grade ore is accessed following the current pushback in the open pit and 3 lower energy costs as we connect to lower cost grid power in 2009 we are targeting production of 70 million pounds of copper as a result of a sustained period of processing high head grades and we complete our phase 3 expansion to 3 200 tpd of mill throughput
8215201 monetary policy at the moment is roughly where it should be and i think the discussion about declining rates in europe is premature
8215202 if the economic outlook brightens somewhat again towards the end of the year and next year which i still expect well have to see if action is necessary
8215203 i dont expect inflation to come down necessarily just with weaker growth
8215204 inflation is still the number one worry for central bankers in the euro region
8215205 were not even sure that inflation on average will be below 2 percent in 2010
8215206 if inflation risks further materialize and if we come to the conclusion that the inflation outlook has deteriorated well have to re examine our monetary policy stance
8215207 the european economy in my opinion will be robust once were through this dry spell
8215208 the group is determined to further reduce its fixed cost base through greater use of synergies technology outsourcing and new streamlined work practices
8215209 while it is difficult to forecast advertising revenues reliably for the second half as we have only experienced the two traditionally quiet summer months trading in the next three months leading up to christmas will be critical in determining the full year result
8215210 however as second half comparators are easier and assuming a continuation of the first half advertising trends inm believes that it will achieve profits in line with consensus forecasts for the full year
8215211 it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media

8215255 we as an opposition group can stand separately from that and it gives us the ability to ask the hard questions the public deserves
8215256 we want to see more details from the co operative and what plans there are to minimise the impact on the city centre

8215315 also technology wise the 360 is very different to the ps3 and because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
8215316 is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself

8215361 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for

8215369 the research does indicate that there is a relationship between advertising and childrens food and beverage preferences and requests
8215370 it also indicates a relationship between television viewing as distinct from television advertising specifically and obesity in children
8215371 however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity indeed only a modest association is apparent
8215372 whilst a well informed debate about the potential impact of food advertising during childrens programming is important evidence to support advertising bans as a solution to childhood obesity does not stack up
8215373 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
8215374 regardless of firm size most participants have not taken all of the necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition in the event of a change in the senior management team
8215375 this lack of preparedness poses a threat to both the role and personal wealth of the principal and will almost certainly affect the other owners of the management company as well as investors in the firms funds
8215376 our research suggests that these firms are overrating their level of preparedness as nearly 60 percent have not reviewed the plan in three years or more
8215377 our analysis suggests they have breathing room and where they probably need to raise additional capital at some point there is no urgency to do so

8215434 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8215435 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

8215450 it must be emphasized moreover that the original complaint for the cancellation of the eccs of the small scale mining permits of pgmc has already been rendered moot and academic as these already expired last april 2008
8215451 thus there being no more valid and existing small scale mining permits the issue of the cancellation of the eccs of the permits regarding over extraction of minerals and other violations by pgmc is no longer necessary
8215452 we had special board meeting on this and we deliberated on the complaint of the other party pgmc regarding orientals prospectus the legal cases were disclosed in the prospectus and we found no reason to deny the application
8215453 a reading of the foregoing grounds reveals the intention of the lawmakers to make the registration and issuance of securities dependent to a certain extent on the merits of the securities themselves and of the issuer to be determined by the sec
8215454 this measure was meant to protect the interest of the investing public against fraudulent and worthless securities and the sec is mandated by law to safeguard these interests following the policies and rules therefore provided
8215455 the absolute reliance on the full disclosure method in the registration of securities is therefore untenable
8215456 they cannot really point their fingers to the company the situation right now is beyond the control of oriental public investors are unwarranted victims
8215457 for example they want to invest in other mining claims they can do that as long as they disclose it to the public we dont impose penalties on deviation but on non disclosure
8215458 i dont think the price of the stock would go anywhere until these are resolved
8215459 the public is very trusting maybe thats why they still bought oriental shares despite pending cases its because they trust that regulators examined the risks very well
8215460 now in cases like this the regulators may need to look at the requirements again be more observant of what the situation really is and lay down more stringent rules
8215461 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country

8215464 1080p or full hd is the video quality benchmark set by the blu ray disc format

8215482 must work well in a collaborative team environment as well as independently
8215483 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8215484 you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
8215485 look if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here to october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009
8215486 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word

8215489 the computer models are all over the place right now
8215490 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8215491 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8215492 we remain committed to a dialogue process that is going to produce an acceptable outcome for all the players an inclusive government we are against this unilateralism and arrogance
8215493 he mugabe could go ahead as he says and form a new government but he will be governing without the control of parliament
8215494 the mdc will obviously try to make it difficult for mugabes government by for instance refusing to approve the budget but in our current set up parliament has limited influence in governance
8215495 he mugabe may simply decide to go ahead without them the mdc he will obviously tell other sadc governments that he has been reasonable and offering them mdc posts within his government
8215496 but i think that at least some sadc countries will see through that and will say that this is not a real settlement
8215497 the cabinet that i had was the worst in history they only look at themselves they are unreliable but not all of them the people are suffering
8215498 we have it in our power to begin the world over again

8215503 es war sozusagen ein stunt skorpion mit dem wir es zu tun hatten also kein echtes tier
8215504 we could see that the future without a doubt lies with ip based software for video surveillance management this is where there is constant development and innovation with new ideas and weve already seen big improvements in the quality of our surveillance
8215505 when customers come into our swedish netto locations the first thing they see is a screen where they can view themselves walking into the supermarket theres no doubt that the surveillance has a preventive effect thereby reducing not only the number of thefts in our stores but also ensuring better safety for our employees against robberies
8215506 climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing us today both here in scotland and across the world we want scotland and its local communities to be part of the global solution
8215507 there are many things we can do as individuals to reduce our carbon emissions but by acting and working together as communities we can do much more
8215508 thats why supporting communities such as barra and vatersay through the climate challenge fund is so important it will empower people to take action to reduce their carbon footprint and make a real difference to the local and national environment
8215509 the scottish government with the scottish greens has launched the 18 8 million fund to deliver innovative solutions at a local level such as improving energy efficiency promoting renewable energy and producing local sustainable food
8215510 in the current economic climate it makes sense to ensure that the running costs of the home you are living in or buying are as low as possible as well as helping to cut down on your carbon dioxide emissions
8215511 ensuring that a home is as energy efficient as possible is a great way to help make sure that you keep bills down over the longer term
8215512 however while green features are demonstrably important in selling a property and with rising gas prices they are undoubtedly becoming more important these are only some of the features that people consider in their list when choosing a home
8215513 we faced a stark choice between sacrificing the brackish marsh or losing the whole site to the sea
8215514 the way we are looking at addressing the problem by adapting is the kind of thing we would do to adapt to climate change creating saltmarshes is the best kind of sea defence we can have

8215517 anaerobic digestion is extremely attractive why would we go on throwing food waste into holes in the ground when we could generate our own electricity and end up with a product that can be returned to the soil
8215518 it seems to me that a plant on this scale would fit into any industrial estate in the country
8215519 while the decision has to be taken locally and in consultation with residents i am sure this is the way forward

8215523 the commission for energy regulation announced that with the enhanced grid connection and modification it would be possible to have 42 of irelands electricity supply from renewable energy
8215524 other factors include the introduction of new tariffs for offshore wind and marine energy
8215525 the new tariff for marine energy devices will prove to be a significant boost to irelands fledgling marine renewables industry and looks to be one of the first feed in tariffs for marine technologies
8215526 of the 18 days beijing reported grade i air quality in nine days and in the other nine days the air quality was grade ii

8215548 congratulations to mr scott on taking on the leadership of the liberal democrats with such a small membership and so little support for the liberal democrats tavish scott faces an uphill task with polls showing few people know who he is the libdems have voted for more of the same in an invisible election for an invisible man tavish scott is responsible for their dire election results and their catastrophic decision to reject a coalition
8215549 tavish has distinguished himself as both a backbencher and a minister during his time in the scottish parliament he has shown he can rise above narrow partisan politics for the overall good of scottish people when he served as transport minister on the scottish executive in coalition with the labour party he is to be congratulated on his victory

8215574 however the market is vast and there are still competitive rates for those who take the time to compare the offers available
8215575 the key to successfully navigating through the current storm is to ensure you do your homework check your credit file looks as good as it can and potentially seek expert advice from a broker

8215628 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8215629 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8215630 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8215631 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8215632 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8215633 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8215634 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8215635 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8215636 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8215637 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8215638 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8215639 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8215640 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8215641 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8215642 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8215643 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8215644 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8215645 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8215646 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8215647 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8215648 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8215649 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing

8215685 heh it seems he was in a hurry to write that dont you agree
8215686 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8215687 sounds fair to me after all they are not really selling
8215688 there are black spots on or around the paintings and engravings at least fifty percent of the cave has been affected by the mould
8215689 there are indeed black spots in the right section of the caves but they affect only a small number of paintings i think that a total of one percent of the cave walls are affected the rest are in excellent condition
8215690 there is not yet any danger but we have to remain alert
8215691 the drawings and engravings are really of unusually high value
8215692 it is not just their age some 17 000 to 18 000 years but also the enormous diversity of drawings and engravings and maybe most of all their artistic quality they are gems of art history they display artistic genius
8215693 in the mid 1970s we thought the situation was under control
8215694 temperature and humidity were stable again but never again would masses of visitors be allowed into the caves
8215695 for some forty years everything had gone well but for inexplicable reasons it was decided in 2000 to install new equipment well that turned into a catastrophe
8215696 in addition to that all protocols were violated workers were entering and leaving all the time the roof over the entrance was simply taken down all requirements for safe low level lighting in the caves were simply ignored
8215697 they are also on the drawings since those are often done in black too it is sometimes hard to see where the drawing ends and the mould begins

8215704 sometimes these thunderstorm cells can produce tornadoes and strong straight line winds
8215705 we have an emergency procedures handbook and when anything like this goes on we keep the kids in the school
8215706 by the time the kids were ready to leave and the buses were there the storm had passed
8215707 some of the spruce trees are over 30 feet tall its ripped them right out of the ground
8215708 it picked up a full 45 gallon water barrel and tossed it across the yard like it was empty
8215709 that one must have flown over twenty feet high to hit those trees
8215710 ive seen some storms before but nothing like this you can fix the buildings but the damage to the trees can never be replaced

8215786 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8215787 america has never been afraid of the future and we shouldnt start now
8215788 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8215789 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8215790 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8215791 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8215792 so youre accusing senator obama of being in favor of infanticide
8215793 so youre accusing senator obama of fill in the blank
8215794 dont commit adultery with your next door neighbor mrs smith
8215795 this is un american a violation of the principle of separation of church and state
8215796 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8215797 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8215798 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8215799 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8215800 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8215801 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8215802 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8215803 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8215804 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8215805 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8215806 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8215807 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8215808 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons
8215809 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8215810 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8215811 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins as i say the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8215812 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8215813 we are blessed in the 21st century with crystal clear photographs and action films of the living realities within their pregnant mothers no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any faith anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8215814 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8215815 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8215816 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state
8215817 but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8215818 the catechism of the catholic church is clear the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8215819 on meet the press this past sunday speaker of the house nancy pelosi made statements regarding the teaching of the catholic church human life and abortion that were incorrect we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record the catechism of the catholic church is clear human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8216014 when i was growing up in east hull the old enemy was always hull fc
8216015 there was no bigger game than hull kr v hull when i was a ball boy at rovers although for me thats now been overshadowed by our derbies against wigan
8216016 nevertheless playing hull does add more spice to the occasion for me
8216017 some hull fans wont even eat bacon because its red and white but its always friendly rivalry with nothing aggressive
8216018 that semi final defeat by hull still hurts and it was one of the worst moments of my career
8216019 i was devastated and its worse for a young kid on the block rather than a battle hardened professional
8216020 losing in a semi final is always harder to take than in the final
8216021 but not being too dramatic about that happens all the time in our sport it was just highlighted more because it was in a high profile game watched by millions of tv viewers
8216022 people say how brave i was but thats part of the game soccer players may be out for three or four weeks with a broken nose but we just get on with it without any fuss
8216023 i did not want that match to be the defining moment in my career and always hoped i would have another chance to play in a final
8216024 they have had a difficult season with so many injuries and a new coach but they have a very talented team nevertheless making us 7 1 on favourites in a two horse race is bizarre
8216025 fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best so i feel like ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me
8216026 its quite crazy to play tennis in such a crazy city
8216027 id never met don king and i think the rivalry is at its peak right now i thought the whole don king thing would make it more interesting
8216028 its stupid rules that somebody made in 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way

8216030 we have spoken to a female witness who was walking home at 5pm past croydon road on thursday august 7 less than one hour after ms xi was last seen alive the witness saw three people standing at the front gate to 8 croydon road
8216031 two of the individuals had their backs to her she could not see what they looked like or whether they were men or women however they were a similar height to the third individual who she got a good look at
8216032 it is important for us to trace these three and speak to them as they may have important information

8216035 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us

8216039 the sign was originally hand painted by the architect and artist mary colter who created the desert view watch tower in 1932 its not your typical national park signage it is in and of itself a national historic landmark and vandalizing it with white out and a permanent marker is akin to say painting graffiti on the lincoln memorial
8216040 i guess i have to take exception to how they do it sometimes though
8216041 here is another thought language is an organic thing it does change a lot of us suffered under the tyranny of noah webster in school spelling bees and lists of vocabulary words presented in no particular context we praise webster for being concerned about orthography and for streamlining some of our version of the queens english however we anthropologists know that language works best when it works well that is language written or oral needs to communicate effectively and over the years people do things with language that appall their ancestors but still communicate effectively
8216042 the parliament session will be held from oct 17 to nov 21

8216046 the impact of climate change on the cedar forests of lebanon will be on natural regeneration because we will have a lack of snow
8216047 secondly there could be an increase of diseases and insect infections because of warmer temperatures
8216048 things could be difficult because the highest point on this mountain is 2000 metres above sea level so the cedar forests in lebanon could disappear
8216049 till now we have healthy cedar forests especially here in the chouf cedar nature reserve
8216050 we are trying to plant new cedar forests we have a project to plant 100 000 seedlings
8216051 you can find the cedar on stamps on money on our national flag so it is very important culturally and its our heritage
8216052 the cedar is always the symbol for strength power fertility continuity and the feeling that the human being is eternal
8216053 a new style of leadership is needed in the u s senate people see the need people like the new ideas we need to look at the issues as alaskans as americans

8216059 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8216060 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens

8216062 staff are extremely frustrated and angry to an extent in as much that their concerns are not being addressed
8216063 its becoming an almost impossible situation where you have a large group reduced teaching time and its not fair on the students
8216064 theyre getting quite tired overworked lecturers in front of them fewer teaching hours and also theyre crammed in large groups in these small rooms theyre not getting their moneys worth
8216065 this action by a small minority of college staff will not have any impact on the high standard of teaching and work of the college
8216066 as a result of the colleges good name there is an increase in demand for places on courses and on average class sizes can be between 10 16 students groups of over 18 are an exception and lecturers get extra time as a result to support students

8216074 it raymonds open source concept accepted the idea of commercial interests from the start
8216075 it saw new business models evolving from shared development effort
8216076 isnt open source a community based movement that was set to overtake the world of commercial software wasnt the famous lamp stack linux apache mysql and perl python and php going to open a world in which software existed outside the traditional realm of property
8216077 it is almost impossible to tell the difference between the most popular open source software and commercial alternatives
8216078 what tends to get lost is this the fact that business is friendly to foss does not mean that it has adopted its values
8216079 the free software camps concern with philosophical and political freedom has almost certainly not been adopted by most foss friendly companies while the open source camps emphasis on increased software quality is probably shared by middle management at best business gasp is interested in foss to improve the bottom line and often no other reason
8216080 there isnt a grand contradiction between giving code away seeding the market and suggesting a purchase reaping the market in fact the two go together perfectly as we realize this open source will become even more dominant open source and business can be bosom buddies not enemies
8216081 sooner or later an open source business is going to act more like a business and less like a citizen of the foss community
8216082 the two can certainly co exist and both can benefit from doing so but forced to choose the average foss based business is going to choose business interests over foss every time
8216083 we are pleased to have delivered solid fiscal year growth of 32 percent over last year and to have ended our fiscal year with record fourth quarter revenue that grew by 10 percent sequentially
8216084 the research does indicate that there is a relationship between advertising and childrens food and beverage preferences and requests
8216085 it also indicates a relationship between television viewing as distinct from television advertising specifically and obesity in children
8216086 however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity indeed only a modest association is apparent
8216087 whilst a well informed debate about the potential impact of food advertising during childrens programming is important evidence to support advertising bans as a solution to childhood obesity does not stack up
8216088 childhood obesity is not unique to australia and governments around the world that have tried to restrict advertising to children have found that it does little to solve the problem

8216120 theres bacterial issues that people instinctively raise with recycled water for potable use there are other pharmacological issues are well its a very complex area
8216121 sewage is the most dangerous water supply you can find as a source for water one of the best things weve done to improve public health in the last 150 years was to keep sewage out of drinking water
8216122 the water coming out of these high membrane type processes is of a very high quality compared to the source waters we are using all over the world for drinking water supply
8216123 we have feedlots in some of our catchments and they do introduce some contaminants some safety issues into the reservoir
8216124 but those risks are managed by the natural system and the water treatment plant so that when you and i drink water there is a risk associated but at such a low level that you dont think about it
8216125 the purified recycled water coming from the advanced treatment plant will typically be of a higher standard than the water that flows into the reservoir from run off when you get rain events they the seven treatment barriers basically take the risks to the same level as dam water the risk to the consumer or the safety of the water is exactly the same
8216126 how many places in australia are in a situation where you really have to use sewage
8216127 some of those differences in approach will start to become less significant because everybodys working off the same base in terms of standards

8216140 id be a little bit disappointed if players are out on their own and their going to a real 50 50 contest

8216146 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight
8216147 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8216148 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind

8216150 todays announcement reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy
8216151 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8216152 that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8216153 we have now lived through the first so called economic expansion on record where typical families saw their incomes fall and working age households lost more than 2 000 from their paychecks another 816 000 americans fell into poverty

8216159 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8216160 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8216161 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8216162 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8216163 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8216164 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8216165 when i was closing the short sale at the ritz carlton in washington dc i was faced with 3 mortgages past due condo fees and tax liens but because i was able to prove that the short sale would benefit the bank i was able to stop the foreclosure and get the entire deal done from start to finish in 28 days
8216166 having a knowledgeable and savvy realtor is essential to negotiating the short sale process with a bank
8216167 if you want to improve the chances of your bank accepting a short sale you ultimately need to prove that a foreclosure on the property is imminent
8216168 there is a popular misconception that homes sold through a short sale are

8216282 sting plays a very fundamentally important role in the recognition of virus infection
8216283 we respond by making interferon if you dont have interferon you have no antiviral defense
8216284 this molecule facilitates the production of interferon and innate immune response in reaction to dna viruses and certain rna viruses
8216285 a major discovery that provides important information about the mechanisms whereby dna cancer viruses such as hpv and ebv evade the immune system
8216286 theres all sorts of very very exciting things going on
8216287 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
8216288 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
8216289 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
8216290 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
8216291 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
8216292 this is a very popular group in an area that is in dire need of this type of service we hope to reach as many families as we can
8216293 amsa academy strives to empower medical students to effect change in medicine
8216294 as the world of medicine changes everyday the next generation of physicians will need different skills than their predecessors the modern healthcare system needs physicians with a broader understanding of their patients the ability to draw on multiple disciplines outside of medical science and the ability to effect change in an imperfect healthcare delivery system

8216297 insgesamt schnitt der internetseiten baukasten von strato sogar besser ab als der testsieger der programme
8216298 most of the doctors and residents out there taking this test know they dont have this auditory skill
8216299 the skill level required to recognize these murmurs is much different than it used to be
8216300 traditional curriculum is that you lecture for a couple hours and maybe play 25 beats of a murmur but the students have never heard enough of each type of murmur to be able to recognize it in a patient or before the boards
8216301 they know they cant recognize these murmurs until they take our course
8216302 apart from the medical school exams this is the bottleneck examination that determines if youll practice as a doctor
8216303 people will be faced with choosing whether they want to pay two dollars a gallon or six or eight dollars a gallon
8216304 its the application of modern science which put beyond doubt a lot of questions about offenders identity
8216305 dna is a fantastic tool of linking the traces someone leaves at a place on a person or objects
8216306 because shes dead its now a difficult case to prosecute
8216307 however the crown is prepared to prosecute on the evidence available which shows the strength of the dna
8216308 dna doesnt prove an offence what it does is link a person to a crime scene
8216309 the most valuable part is where you dont have a suspect but you have a data base you take a profile from a crime scene which is then matched against the data base and that gives you a suspect
8216310 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8216311 its the worst thing that could possibly happen its what we hoped would never happen
8216312 we must not waste itos efforts i believe we should continue our activities
8216313 economically things have changed in the last 18 months and we are in a financial downturn costs for food and fuel are going up and a percentage of people attending green man are finding things harder
8216314 not to respond and recognise this is irresponsible and uncaring to an audience that has been so loyal the offer is open to everyone but hopefully it will give green man regulars such as students and families on lower incomes a better chance of attending
8216315 how a clueless guy wrote a sales letter that converts at 5
8216316 if a clueless guy can accomplish it i sure can im not clueless
8216317 how a clueless joe crafted a sales copy that converts at 5 even though he did it wrong
8216318 and now you get to discover the techniques he exploits when he is doing it right
8216319 i believe the whole positioning puts us back very strongly where weve traditionally done well of offering greater value for money
8216320 this is about bringing triple and quad core processors to a wider audience

8216323 when we make decisions about how elections are run we all need to think about the voters interests above all else elections are the opportunity for citizens to take part in the democratic process and have their say about how we are governed and the services we receive
8216324 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and coordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain

8216327 we knew we had to take a risk for valencia and we did not finish the race

8216332 the friday practice was good i had a good feeling in the car
8216333 but saturday was a little bit cooler and we struggled again in qualifying
8216334 obviously there has been a lot of talk about my qualifying problems
8216335 but in hungary i just went wide on my last lap of q3 without that we would easily have been third then we got the fourth place and after that i knew the race would be very difficult again
8216336 i love that circuit and obviously i would love to race there for the whole year long

8216348 hospice and palliative medicine is a newly recognized medical subspecialty
8216349 this unique specialty reflects the need for specialized medical care for the growing number of older adults and persons with serious complex and chronic illnesses which currently pose an enormous challenge to the healthcare industry
8216350 there is a much greater demand than supply of physicians skilled in hospice and palliative medicine
8216351 well trained physicians in this field have unlimited opportunities aahpm is steadily expanding educational opportunities so that physicians who want to move into hospice and palliative medicine have more learning opportunities
8216352 the unipac book series helps to form a strong foundation for developing these skills
8216353 like good textbooks the unipac booklets have multiple contributors and have been peer reviewed by the leaders in the field
8216354 when we make decisions about how elections are run we all need to think about the voters interests above all else elections are the opportunity for citizens to take part in the democratic process and have their say about how we are governed and the services we receive

8216363 i phoned artur on monday to tell him before it was made public i wanted him to hear first and get a full explanation for my decision
8216364 i wanted to stress that his poland career is not over artur made a mistake in life we all make them
8216365 it was a very difficult decision to drop them one of the hardest ive ever taken
8216366 i spent the whole weekend thinking about it and struggled to get my head round it it still hurts to think about what i am doing but i have no option
8216367 ive the same sort of feeling i have had in the past many times as a father sometimes your kids do things that disappoint you
8216368 when that happens you have to punish them and show them the right way but you still love them
8216369 i cannot explain the decision because i would need to raise a number of details of that evening thats something i wont do im a coach im not in the business of destroying reputations
8216370 i know there are different versions and speculation but thats fine by me i wont add fuel to the fire
8216371 see that guy spencer barack he thinks hes freakin batman
8216372 does not use the phrase war on terrorism more remarkably he doesnt mention islam much less islamic extremism which mr bush has described as a critical ideological threat to freedom inside and outside the muslim world
8216373 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
8216374 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it is fundamentally different
8216375 there has been a shift in islam that i believe is connected to the failures of governments and the failures of the west to work with many of these countries in order to make sure that opportunities are there that theres bottom up economic growth
8216376 failures of the west to work with many of these countries
8216377 but what we also want to do is to shrink the pool of potential recruits and that involves engaging the islamic world rather than vilifying it and making sure that we understand that not only are those in islam who would resort to violence a tiny fraction of the islamic world but that also the islamic world itself is diverse
8216378 if they can bring us information that says they can insure their operation properly that theyre going to have the wherewithal to get a picture of whats happening below the ground before they start and that monitoring is before the fact
8216379 theres a tremendous amount of information that has to be obtained to be submitted with an application
8216380 there are a lot of requirements that have to be met in this both in terms of getting the application completed as well as operations
8216381 i brought forward the point about the difficulty on any given landowner to be burdened with having to prove that it was the gravel operator that damaged the water im rather hung up on leaving the burden of proof on the neighboring resident to take on the gravel industry
8216382 proving the producer was responsible could cost more than 5 million in my mind
8216383 were looking at that and there may be another idea that comes forward we want to provide assurance that if there was damage that it would be covered
8216384 weve tried to make this kind of a family effort if you will
8216385 if you walk through the police station now the lights are off in the halls people are turning off the bathroom lights
8216386 weve done an awful lot of walking and bicycle patrol
8216387 much more so this summer that has a lot of savings in fuel as well as more face time
8216388 the way we look at it is every citizen is having to examine their driving habits and so are we
8216389 our community is just not designed to have a designated downtown foot patrol in the traditional sense theres a lot of vehicular patrol
8216390 the bottom line is i dont want to diminish what the public feels they should have from the police department
8216391 its the cost of doing business right now and so far its affordable the budgets able to carry it
8216392 it reflects that those real high years of construction cost increases have leveled off
8216393 well reduce consumption but the cost might be just as high
8216394 im looking and a lot of our budgets are already coming up close to being busted

8216397 we are now moving ahead with the large scale consolidation of cell sites a key objective was to ensure that we achieve scale and integrate quickly and smoothly minimizing costs whilst quickly expanding coverage so as to enable a much improved service experience for our growing number of mobile internet and broadband customers we believe that with nokia siemens networks as our principal technology partner mbnl will deliver on its objective of creating what will be europes largest hsdpa network in record timescales
8216398 high speed mobile broadband is going to be a key enabler for both consumers and businesses looking for convenient access to internet based services wherever they are this innovative network collaboration agreement will help to accelerate the adoption of new services in a timescale each of us could not have achieved on our own it also enables us to cost effectively meet customer demand for wider coverage faster speeds and greater capacity that is starting to arise as mobile devices become the most cost effective and convenient route to access the internet
8216399 this contract is an endorsement of our successful partnership with the two companies and we are committed to supporting them in their growth objectives as well as simplifying the network and reducing their operating costs our role in creating the uks largest 3g network underscores nokia siemens networks leadership in managing advanced and complex network integration projects for the benefit of our customers
8216400 demand for high performance smart mobile devices continues to see strong growth globally and htc is well positioned to meet the varying needs of our diverse customer base
8216401 the htc s740 combines a powerful premium phone with a full slide out keypad in a compact and sleek form factor clearly one size does not fit all and the s740 will play an important role in expanding our growing portfolio of devices
8216402 nutritionally enhanced white bread like weston moelleux plus provides the fibre of whole wheat bread in white bread some consumers are asking how bread can remain white if we add more fibre
8216403 we could not have said it better ourselves so were letting her tell the story via a publi sac and a microsite
8216404 were also putting stickers on all weston packaging that directs consumers to the site
8216405 kids seemed to be turned off by anything that is not pure white but the weston bread shows no visible signs of whole wheat so the kids win and parents looking for nutrition win
8216406 motorolas latest push to talk over cellular release demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and relevant applications that enable service providers to offer both enterprises and consumers a truly competitive communications experience
8216407 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
8216408 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
8216409 theyre a leading company in their field they produce good products and they have stepped into the breach when necessary so in six months everybody will have forgotten about it
8216410 maple leafs strategy is almost a textbook copy of what johnson amp johnson did
8216411 what theyre doing is protecting the brand and its the brand that matters in the long term for maple leaf without the brand they dont have anything
8216412 so theyve been very very proactive about it unusually so because most companies that go through crises of this nature tend to hide its quite commendable from a business point of view
8216413 i think theres enough lawyers out there who like this kind of business there will be lawsuits
8216414 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8216415 thats nice that at least they have some fun in the drab of assembling technology

8216442 i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100
8216443 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8216444 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8216445 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county
8216446 we are pleased we made 10 changes a few of the players needed a game and it took them a bit of time to warm up but i thought we deserved it
8216447 in the first half we had one or two opportunities but never took them but once the first goal went in i thought we were comfortable
8216448 they could have turned up here thinking it was going to be a stroll in the park the attitude was very good
8216449 they are not second string players because the squad is very important this year i might pick teams to play at our place and pick teams to play away so everyone is part of it and we need everyone as well
8216450 there is not tens of millions but if as a club we think its the right thing to do to strengthen then were in a position to do that
8216451 were having a think about whether weve got enough in terms of the squad
8216452 there may be areas that we feel we may need a bit more cover but weve got a very close knit squad and everyone is involved
8216453 the good thing is that there are two or three youngsters who i think could possibly come into the side this season and make an impact and i dont want to bar their path
8216454 just to be here and be able to compete is a great achievement
8216455 i could feel in some shots a lack of practice and even shot selection
8216456 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8216457 hes turned up back here with us as a different bloke and hes been brilliant
8216458 isas have been an enormously popular means of saving so collectively the industry has taken decisive action to resolve some of the immediate issues facing customers now we are moving our focus to the longer term to ensure the isa transfer process is robust and efficient for customers
8216459 im just pleased to be in the next round ive got to give dave penney and his side a lot of credit because they were the better side for long periods tonight
8216460 it took a little bit longer than we would have expected but we should have closed the game out
8216461 that is what you get when you have an inexperienced side out there but they will learn from that
8216462 scott loach was very impressive for me as was liam henderson when he came on for his debut
8216463 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites

8216472 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8216473 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8216474 you cant divide the people who live in this area
8216475 mccain opposes gay marriage but also a constitutional amendment against it and has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions apart from opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion he is against most abortion rights and says he would favor overturning the supreme court decision affirming those rights
8216476 if you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten either write things worth reading or do things worth writing
8216477 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
8216478 nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
8216479 i do not feel obliged to believe that the same god who has endowed us with sense reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use
8216480 if you cant say anything nice come sit by me
8216481 the beautiful part of writing is that you dont have to get it right the first time unlike say a brain surgeon
8216482 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not satisfaction in a good novel must be intolerably stupid

8216507 in any application that needs electricity or power the fuel cell can be used in a car it would replace an engine in a building it would replace the generator or however they make their power in a cell phone it would replace the battery
8216508 you can buy a fuel cell today for a building the cost right now is still very expensive and so it isnt that common youre starting to see them being used as backup power and more and more as primary power
8216509 there are quite a few different fuel cell technologies out there different ones have technical specifications that are more in line with particular applications

8216593 venerd mattina i vicini di casa hanno visto davanti alla residenza di suu kyi due assistenti di gambari che urlavano ad alta voce il nome dellinviato dellonu quando nessuno uscito per incontrarli sono andati via
8216594 il signor gambari ha sempre sfruttato lopportunit di farsi fotografare con daw suu kyi per dare limpressione che il processo di dialogo politico da lui condotto per conto dellonu stesse funzionando
8216595 stavolta per niente foto suu kyi ha mandato un messaggio forte al popolo birmano rifiutandosi di incontrare il signor gambari
8216596 vuole far sapere al popolo che non si pu contare sullonu per ottenere risultati bisogna reggersi sulle proprie gambe

8216622 at 1 50am two officers on routine patrol say they observed mr days car travelling at speed in the opposite direction while they stopped at a junction
8216623 they turned their police car round as mr day drove though a red light
8216624 they operated their blue light to bring his vehicle to a halt and they followed him they indicated him to stop which he did

8216638 in my view thats inaccurate i dont know where thats come from
8216639 i cant give you any specifics of those two situations because of confidentiality requirements
8216640 when the two events were identified we immediately disclosed them to the state and also made full and complete disclosure to the families which is our practice to do

8216688 typically over the last six or seven years i have seen that if worldwide panel prices go up as manufacturers claim this region somehow doesnt follow the trend
8216689 either there is not enough inventory or the local offices have taken it before prices go up
8216690 from the supply base if panel costs erode then sooner or later we will see this cost downturn effect in our local market pricing and the same applies in reverse
8216691 however across the middle east we do have some local seasonality trading periods coming into play in the next 60 days which will kick off promotional activities across the channel driven by display vendors this may not be a direct result from the lcd panel prices themselves but simply margin and dollar investment from the display vendors to stimulate end user buying decisions during this seasonality period
8216692 two months back a 17 inch screen was us 157 today it is us 134
8216693 panel prices have gone down drastically if you continue selling you can make a margin but if you keep stocks then making a profit becomes impossible
8216694 wholesale prices have come down especially in the 17 inch segment as prices for 19 inch screens have come down to us 155
8216695 the competition has become much more fierce because many of the brands are fighting it out for top spot and there is immense rivalry on the price side

8216785 its the vibrations that have been doing my head in and im not the only one
8216786 i was in the house last week and i heard a loud drumming noise when i went to check i realised that it was coming from glass panes in my door which were rattling and vibrating because the house and ground was shaking so much if i can feel it across the road it must be horrendous for those living in houses on the same side as the actual site
8216787 i know that the work being carried out is for the good of the flood scheme for forres
8216788 thats fair enough and no one wants to complain but if someone had even told us that at some stage they would be doing this it wouldnt lessen the situation but at least we would have been aware
8216789 we now have a glossy brochure which details every slight imperfection or crack around the whole house
8216790 at least we have got that if there is anything afterwards
8216791 it is already a very old building with structural problems and must be feeling it
8216792 there were cracks in the old building i dont suppose this will make them any better
8216793 it is those people who live further out along st leonards road that are much closer to this phase of the work that are suffering
8216794 whilst we look out directly over the works offices the car park and what appears to be a large open cast mine we accept that we have to tolerate the noise disturbance and dust of the project in the short term for the long term benefit of those who live in parts of forres that are susceptible to flooding
8216795 all the complaints have been attended to by either morrison construction or site supervisory staff
8216796 it is our understanding that all the residents that were spoken to were satisfied with the explanations given
8216797 the contract contains specific requirements regarding vibration that are based on allowable limits to prevent damage to residential property
8216798 the contractor is required to monitor vibration and the records to date show that the vibration at the boundary of the site and the houses in st leonards road is well within the allowable limits progress with the work is weather dependent but should be completed by the end of september
8216799 ricky played in a friendly match on tuesday and scored a hat trick there as well so hes looking good and he came away with three goals which im very pleased with they were quality finishes and there were a couple of good chances for other players that werent taking so it was important that he put those ones away
8216800 im glad weve got the three points but i dont think we played anywhere near what we are capable of and in fairness to fort william they gave us a real scare i think we did enough in chances to win the game so yes we were worth the points but it was nowhere near the performance that im looking for in this team
8216801 the boy came in high and late and hit davie calder right in the ankle hes had an ice pack on it today and we are hoping to see a physio in midweek to see if hes fit enough to play against keith
8216802 if its a swelling it can go down and hell hopefully be back in training but it looks quite bad there are a couple of stud marks on the side of the ankle and itll take a couple of days to calm down
8216803 i think graeme will still be out next week hes got a slight problem with his knee and he was doing some light running before todays game and in training during the week but i still think it will be too early to put him in for next week but well check his progress through the week

8216806 we have opted to get to guernsey the hard way and whilst we are prepared to put in the sweat and tears we need lots of sponsorship to raise money for these deserving causes to make it all worthwhile
8216807 a number of guernsey companies have been very generous in their support including specsavers which was originally launched in guernsey through the elgin branch the guernsey stock exchange and ian browns cycle shop but we do need more
8216808 we will be doing an average of 115 miles every day itll be hard work but definitely worthwhile
8216809 id like to thank specsavers and everyone who has pledged to support us

8216830 she never liked the mayor and the mayor was lukewarm toward her
8216831 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
8216832 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8216833 then they seem to have come together to work together

8217026 the safety and accuracy of the stereotaxis system has been well documented in electrophysiology procedures as have its ergonomic advantages and reduction of fluoro exposure
8217027 with a growing diabetic population and increased prevalence of pad i am eager to use the magnetic rf guidewire this will be the first cto crossing device that can enable true intra lesion steering and i expect it to substantially improve the range of options for cto treatment
8217028 traditional manual guidewires used for cto crossing have little or no steering ability and therefore can only be used with great difficulty in tortuous vasculature requiring a high level of operator skill and carrying a risk of vessel perforation
8217029 just as the safety accuracy and efficacy of our niobe magnetic navigation system have contributed significantly to the treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias in the field of electrophysiology we believe that our powerassert rf guidewire will improve the prospects for treating patients with peripheral arterial disease powerassert opens a significant new market opportunity for stereotaxis underscoring the niobe systems capabilities as a platform for a broad and growing array of interventional procedures

8217101 kamu boleh terus sokong datuk seri abdullah sebagai presiden parti tetapi rakyat tidak akan sokong umno kerana ia sudah jadi alat abdullah dan keluarganya
8217102 apabila datang pilihanraya ke 13 rakyat akan jatuhkan umno dan barisan nasional kerana hanya dengan cara ini sahaja rakyat akan dapat jatuhkan abdullah

8217159 but for companies to harness the power of the cloud it should enhance the alignment driven by enterprise architecture driving down the lead times for delivering it value to business from concept to deployment and through maintenance
8217160 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
8217161 i have been very impressed by the top quality entries from edinburgh and lothians this year and congratulate all the finalists from this region on making it on to the shortlist and wish them the best of luck in the final stages
8217162 the scottish thistle awards give us a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the highest quality tourism businesses in edinburgh and lothians
8217163 the cans were a massive part of our campaign and were designed to maintain awareness our research had found that many people found that the galleries were not for them and we wanted to use this to change that view it was also an attempt to take a bit of warhol outside if you dont come in to see it well take it to you
8217164 what was really compelling was the photography used it is the magnificent backdrop of the castle fairground and the big wheel that is edinburghs iconic imagery and encourages people to come here
8217165 edinburgh is rich in economic assets the city is a world renowned tourist destination one of europes foremost financial services centres and is home to a growing cutting edge life sciences industry
8217166 on top of that the labour market in the capital continues to perform robustly and the signs are that the property market in scotland continues to show greater resilience than elsewhere in the uk
8217167 by playing to our clear strengths here in scotland and in edinburgh i am convinced we are well placed to weather the new challenges we are facing and emerge stronger than before
8217168 if we redouble efforts to work together and promote edinburgh as a great place to do business and to visit we can ensure the capitals economy continues to grow
8217169 i can guarantee the government will fully support your efforts to help edinburgh go from strength to strength
8217170 on top of that well continue to look at how we can make sure the planning system operates with the efficiency and certainty needed to support economic growth
8217171 and well continue to push westminster to act on the cost of fuel an issue i know effects business of all sizes by working together i believe we can make edinburgh and scotland a more successful place
8217172 despite the credit crunch there are many funds holding billions of pounds that could be invested in scotland we are working hard to ensure that the city and the country creates the conditions to attract our share of that investment
8217173 in spite of the evidence from economists around the world that metro regions are the new drivers of national wealth the development of a truly integrated economic strategy transport infrastructure and unified partnership across the city region remains work in progress it is plain that our ability to compete with the growing family of world cities depends upon it

8217177 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8217178 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8217179 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8217180 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8217181 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8217182 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8217183 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8217184 as the dawn of the next day approached those of us who remained in the trenches became very anxious for our own safety and when the dawn appeared there were several regiments still on duty at this time a very dense fog began to rise off the river and it seemed to settle in a peculiar manner over both encampments i recollect this peculiar providential occurrence perfectly well and so very dense was the atmosphere that i could scarcely discern a man at six yards distance we tarried until the sun had risen but the fog remained as dense as ever
8217185 may the god of the armies of israel shower down the blessings of his divine providence in the day of battle and danger
8217186 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8217187 i had a first option and a second option that were not possible
8217188 i knew at the time that the club was doing everything possible to get these two players that i wanted or one of them who was not possible but for different reasons and when i was faced with the possibility of shevchenko i said yes because he is no doubts about it a player of high quality
8217189 he was like a prince in milan and in chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody is the same no statues everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove that he deserves to play so i think that maybe he lost some self confidence
8217190 you know the different factors a different life a different club a different league a different environment and step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8217191 i believe that in the future he will again be a player of high quality but maybe he needs the change a different challenge and a different environment to be happy
8217192 he is a very good player and to be fair i wish him to become again the sheva that everybody including myself admires
8217193 with lg15 the resistance we are taking social entertainment to the next level

8217201 this is a hugely positive development for irish racing and were delighted to welcome the tote ireland pools into the ever growing betfair product stable
8217202 betfair customers will now have an even greater betting choice on irish racing and the irish tote pools will benefit from the wider reach that they now have allied to our existing voluntary payment to hri this is further indication of our serious commitment to irish racing
8217203 tote pools offer unique products and features which should be highly appealing to betfair customers
8217204 in consequence we anticipate this agreement will further enhance liquidity in the totes pools and help us further increase our contribution to irish racing

8217232 it will still have a scottish voice unlike some of our competitors
8217233 at that time of the night stations like forth do struggle to get big names into radio stations
8217234 by offering the chance to get heard across scotland we will be able to get bigger names and provide better content
8217235 id be silly to say that money wont be saved but in the whole scheme of things it is not a great deal of money as far as the programming is concerned it is the content that is key
8217236 it is not a surprise that this has happened and bauer arent to be blamed as it is happening to other local radio stations across the uk
8217237 what should be thought about now is the role of regulator ofcom to what degree should it look to reserve control for the regions
8217238 there is still demand for local radio because people get tired of the same old stuff and want broadcasting that speaks to and for them
8217239 in the east of scotland for example people say they will go out to get their messages they want people on radio to speak to them like that and use these phrases it makes for a closer relationship

8217255 the whole point of this is to give people nearing the end of their lives the chance to die with dignity in a place of their choice the reality is old and frail people come to nursing homes to die they know they are not going to move on from there and its amazing how so many of them accept this when they arrive
8217256 this work is essential to guarantee that we are giving elderly people the dignified and respectful care programme they deserve
8217257 this study shows that with better training and improved care frameworks older people can now expect a better standard of care around dying in these nursing homes

8217286 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
8217287 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8217288 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

8217290 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers

8217296 there is much evidence that the suns high activity cycle is levelling off or abating if it is true that the suns activity is of great significance in determining the earths climate this reduced solar activity could work in the opposite direction to climate change caused by humans in that case

8217301 edgar kaiser is running this permanente thing for profit and the reason he can do it i had edgar kaiser come in and talk to me about this and i went into some depth all the incentives are toward less medical care because the less care they give them the more money they make

8217319 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies

8217328 quando la spesa per il personale assorbe il 96 98 del bilancio significa che la scuola italiana rischia di non avere pi gli strumenti per modernizzarsi
8217329 dovere morale verso le nuove generazioni rivedere completamente il sistema scolastico italiano
8217330 evidenziano che se la spesa per il personale ha una tale incidenza significa che la nostra scuola non ha la capacit se non si interviene strutturalmente di rinnovarsi e guardare con serenit al futuro la scuola italiana stata troppo spesso usata in passato come un ammortizzatore sociale
8217331 dobbiamo assolutamente porre rimedio ad una situazione insostenibile un dovere morale verso le nuove generazioni rivedere completamente il sistema scuola in italia
8217332 con un sistema premiale va aumentato il peso specifico di ogni ora di insegnamento
8217333 va loro restituita la funzione sociale che meritano attraverso la premiazione di chi vale non vero che le ore e la spesa sono direttamente proporzionali alla qualit dellinsegnamento

8217337 since i arrived on campus andy has been a great leader for this program on the field in the locker room in the classroom and done everything we ask of all student athletes

8217339 this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about
8217340 i work on the principle that its not possible to take anyones views on music seriously if they dont like the beatles everything else is a question of personal taste and therefore debatable but if you dont recognise the beatles as the twentieth centurys most inventive most influential and most talented composers youre pretty much admitting that youve rather missed the point of the last hundred years of musical endeavour should you fall into that category i do not condemn neither do i mock i merely despair and having despaired i move on

8217400 we wanted to monitor the deterioration of the scrolls and realized we needed to take precise photographs to watch the process thats when we decided to do a comprehensive set of photos both in color and infrared to monitor selectively what is happening we realized then that we could make the entire set of pictures available online to everyone meaning that anyone will be able to see the scrolls in the kind of detail that no one has until now
8217401 therefore not unexpected to find infected animals in the protection zone
8217402 these cases emphasise the need for farmers to be aware of the risks of importing animals from within restricted zones
8217403 it is the only effective tool to protect susceptible animals the message remains clear dont hesitate vaccinate
8217404 bringing stock into the uk from bluetongue infected areas of the continent particularly at this time of year represents a massive risk to domestic animals and should be undertaken with extreme caution
8217405 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8217406 government priorities in the last five years or so have been very clearly environment security of supply and way down the list has been price all of a sudden affordabilty has shot to the top
8217407 if oil drops back to 80 then government can probably live with it the extra cost of climate policies
8217408 weve seen a worsening more to do with economic weakness than anything else its much harder to push through or in some cases even maintain support packages that push up energy costs when consumers are under pressure
8217409 if oil comes below 100 the consumer will bear it
8217410 frank has made the film he wanted to make and hopefully itll be that its a cartoon to me the movie is a cartoon we do wile e coyote type stuff

8217412 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8217413 once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system
8217414 airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations
8217415 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8217416 it is a very difficult situation the area hasnt seen floods for the past 55 years and therefore people were caught unawares the army has been called in using 300 boats thousand have been evacuated
8217417 lf you continue in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free
8217418 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8217419 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8217420 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8217421 only six of our police were wounded in the taliban attack
8217422 we were called at 7 30am after a worker at the recycling centre discovered the body of a newborn baby
8217423 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8217424 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8217425 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8217426 thaksin and now samak stand for something that is diametrically opposed to the pads interests
8217427 the pad is the spearhead of a conservative alliance that wants to stop this
8217428 of course wed like to see the government help the market but our view is slightly different to some other companies
8217429 even if it did intervene through measures like a stamp duty holiday or a fall in interest rates we still think the market would be in a difficult position its not something the government alone can fix
8217430 its not something we have ruled out but we are focussing on sorting out our covenants
8217431 de t nker varken p oss eller p milj n
8217432 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence in curfew bound areas of kandhamal
8217433 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8217434 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8217435 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8217436 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8217437 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8217438 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8217439 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8217440 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8217441 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8217442 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8217443 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8217444 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8217445 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later
8217446 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8217447 this does not jeopardize our partys current leadership abdullah is still a member of parliament and the prime minister
8217448 there are several things were accomplishing this week at the convention
8217449 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain
8217450 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
8217451 we now pay four times more for defense three times more for gasoline and home heating oil and twice what we paid for health care
8217452 we have now narrowed down the vice presidents problems on this thing to one issue and that is whether we should include these health maintenance organizations like edgar kaisers permenente thing
8217453 let me ask you you know im not too keen on any of these damn medical programs
8217454 edgar kaiser is running this permanente thing for profit and the reason he can do it i had edgar kaiser come in and talk to me about this and i went into some depth all the incentives are toward less medical care because the less care they give them the more money they make
8217455 residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8217456 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven to eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8217457 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
8217458 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
8217459 doy gracias a mi angelito de la guarda por haber sobrevivido

8217469 pepe ram rez y elsa barbosa formaban un matrimonio al que era muy f cil querer
8217470 watching him power to victory three times in beijing was truly inspirational and the citys open top bus parade gives as many people as possible the chance to join in the celebrations im sure that edinburgh will give all of the winning medallists a fantastic welcome home
8217471 very few athletes achieve the honour of being selected to represent their country as an olympian and i am sure that all of scotland will join me in congratulating the very successful team gb its 32 scottish members and our four scots medallists
8217472 the scottish governments overriding priority is to see an increase in sporting participation rates throughout scotland and the success of our four medallists can only be a major influence on our young people and help inspire the heroes of tomorrow
8217473 vi har efter min mening ikke politisk tv i danmark

8217476 the intention of the 9 eleven work is to create a revitalised symbol of peace it springs from the idea that the americans should stay at home

8217523 capturing that initial excitement of a new idea and sharing that with the listener
8217524 not being a natural singer id just go with the feel of the songs
8217525 once you get something down on tape that you like you dont really want to change it
8217526 i didnt really plan to make a solo album and certainly not so soon but i guess i had developed a backlog of songs people around me were telling me i should put the songs out so i did
8217527 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market
8217528 mrs walker how many years have you worked for jeffrey and erin tomassi
8217529 him not so well but she confided in me quite a bit i got the feeling she didnt have anyone else to talk to
8217530 tell me mrs walker in all the time you spent with erin did you ever see her do anything intended to hurt someone else
8217531 well once we found this kitten in the gutter in front of their brownstone i brought it inside thinking id take it to the humane society as soon as i finished cleaning but erin picked it up and started lovin on it next thing i know shes feeding it milk and tuna and calling it tinkerbell i thought maybe shed finally found something to help her feel a little less lonely but the kitten was gone when i came back the next week erin said jeffrey wouldnt let her keep it
8217532 i only hope he took it to the humane society instead of dropping it in a dumpster i wondered about that but didnt have the heart to check
8217533 thats an interesting anecdote but it doesnt really establish erin tomassis character after all people can love animals and resent other human beings cant they
8217534 did erin ever say anything about resenting her husband or anyone else in particular
8217535 i dont think so that girl was more sad than hateful but i never heard her say a bad word about her husband or anyone else and generally people who resent other people talk bad about em but erin isnt the gossipy type
8217536 i dont know what happened to her but i know shes not the type to pick fights especially not with her husband he was so much bigger than her
8217537 i vacuumed all the carpets dusted the entire house scrubbed the kitchen sink and counters cleaned the bathrooms changed the sheets in the master bedroom and put fresh flowers on the foyer table erin loves fresh flowers in the foyer
8217538 well sometimes when the weather was nice i raised them up to let in some fresh air
8217539 did you always lower the windows before leaving the house
8217540 if i may be allowed to continue my reasoning will become clear
8217541 is it possible mrs walker that after opening some of the tomassis windows that you might have left a window unlocked
8217542 but on the days when you left and some of the windows were still open someone might have closed a window without locking it correct and it remained unlocked for an indefinite amount of time
8217543 did you find these in the bathroom trash bin or did you ever find them in other areas
8217544 sometimes mr tomassi would test his blood in the kitchen and give himself a shot at the sink
8217545 did he carry that syringe into the bathroom and dispose of it in the special sharps receptacle
8217546 does this look like one of the syringes you occasionally saw in the trash compactor
8217547 and for the record will you state whether or not the cap is on the needle
8217548 unflag high lvl players in all zones they are to high for
8217549 jetzt noch weitere zu bauen und ber 50 jahre an diesen punkten die falsche struktur zu schaffen das halte ich f r absolut falsch dann lieber in erneuerbare energie und einsparungen investieren
8217550 wenn wir ab heute rechnen dann sind wir ber 2050 hinaus und da sage ich bei den vielen geplanten kohlekraftwerken das kriegen wir mit dem co2 aussto berhaupt nicht mehr in den griff
8217551 man hat nur ganz geringe kapazit ten von alten abgeschaltet und die neuen einfach laufen lassen so dass man mehr co2 aussto hat als vorher
8217552 da ist ja jetzt die frage ob die schwarz gr ne koalition ein vor der wahl gegebenes versprechen der schwarzen regierung einh lt oder nicht das ist schon eine ganz massive bedrohung der situation
8217553 das ist ein riesenproblem das wir da haben hier d rfen sich politiker und industrie nicht in die wolle kriegen sondern wir m ssen gemeinsam daf r argumentieren dass wir versorgungssicherheit wirtschaftlichkeit und umweltvertr glichkeit brauchen
8217554 auch wenn die nahrungsmittelpreise weiter kr ftig zulegen und der zugrundeliegende preisauftrieb wegen des st rkeren lohnanstiegs anziehen d rfte
8217555 diese positive tendenz bei der inflationsrate wird allerdings berdecken dass die kernteuerungsrate ohne energie und nahrungsmittelpreise die sich im august mit voraussichtlich 1 3 immer noch auf einem sehr niedrigen niveau befinden d rfte wegen des st rkeren lohnauftriebs allm hlich anzieht
8217556 theyre facing a choice of ok do i concentrate more on doing a thorough inspection or do i concentrate more on getting the paperwork done that says ive been to that plant ive looked at the records and that satisfies the legal requirement for international trade
8217557 we do not have the same presence we used to have in the processing facilities when the cat is away the mice will play
8217558 we are not making the observations we used to make when we had more of a hands on approach we spend more time looking at paper than anything else
8217559 weve had all our authority taken away and now we are just paper pushers
8217560 weve gotten very good information back from people in terms of improved consistency of how work is being done ive personally been seeing more questions coming to me that suggest people are asking questions that may or may not have been asked in the past i feel like cvs actually has been a step in the right direction
8217561 its a very rigorous program and its certainly taking more of our time as well its like someone giving you a surprise exam at school every now and again it is certainly a rigorous program that is being enforced by the cfia
8217562 were getting the feedback that theyre just totally overloaded weve had some inspectors say they want to know should i be dropping the inspection work or should i be dropping the paper work theres no clear direction by cfia on this because i dont think they anticipated the increased work load or at least if they did they didnt have any plans to deal with it
8217563 has some advantages as it is a structured program and spells out clearly what needs to be done however we do not have enough staff to run at full capacity
8217564 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8217565 ill be singing a lot about a heart thats been long pause broken to pieces

8217612 this game is designed to provide an historically accurate and therefore grim violent and salacious depiction of life on the streets of covent garden at the time before there was any organised police force
8217613 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8217614 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8217615 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones

8217626 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
8217627 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
8217628 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
8217629 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china

8217685 they all come into the centre of town looking for trouble and they always get it theres just too much drinking going on and things just escalate
8217686 there was a big gang of them and a pair of them suddenly started fighting the next minute one guy had another man on the ground and stabbed him in the back of the neck with the bottle there was blood all over the street
8217687 then i saw a woman wading into the crowd waving the stiletto of her shoe about to go for the guy
8217688 in fairness to the guards they were on the scene pretty quickly and took him off to the station within minutes but one of the gardai was injured
8217689 he had a wound to his head and his jacket was covered in blood
8217690 well hear tonight whether they are happy to wake him up yet they just want to make sure that he is ready for it

8217707 because of the work being undertaken to trace the location of the burst pipe we havent been able to put our rubbish in the bins provided and leave them outside the block for uplift
8217708 this has meant a huge build up of the bags with the council refusing to uplift them for four weeks

8217713 the original contractor was unable to locate the burst and therefore contact was made with scottish water
8217714 we have at all times appraised owners of the position and kept them informed as to progress we have also impressed upon contractors that they must make areas safe and secure and they are well aware that they must conform to health and safety regulations and for public safety
8217715 contractors have received instructions to backfill any excavations which are no longer required and make safe areas once the final excavation is made to the front of the property
8217716 we have also been in touch with the council to arrange a special uplift for the back court refuse
8217717 finally this is a tenement building and underground bursts are always difficult to trace you will appreciate we require to get to the point of finding where this burst is and to do that excavations are necessary
8217718 we apologise for the inconvenience which has been caused to owners and will ensure that matters are completed as quickly as possible
8217719 scottish water have been working in the close at this block of flats and land services operatives are unable to access the bins while this work is ongoing
8217720 we have asked residents to put bin bags of rubbish out on the street at the front of the property on the normal day for uplift

8217731 lament vel que a r ssia tenha reconhecido a independ ncia da abkh zia e da oss tia do sul
8217732 i do not doubt for a second that this will be a tough fight but this campaign should be a rallying call for the local community we stand the best chance of presenting a strong case for mill street by creating a united front
8217733 given that postwatch scotland have already highlighted concerns about the quality of service that would be received by customers i hope that royal mail when it examines the strength of feeling locally will address the concerns that have been expressed before making a final decision
8217734 if we save it now will it be put forward again for closure some time in the future thats my biggest worry the track record of consultations is very poor and i think that post office ltd should go back to the government and say they cannot go forward with this policy because it is affecting local communities
8217735 the key point is that wallace street works it suits the home helps who can cash pensions and get a little bit of local shopping from the shops there which they couldnt do if they had to traipse to main street and stand in long queues
8217736 it suits elderly people who are often ambulant but disabled they can walk to wallace street for their pension and shopping but the main street is too far
8217737 it suits local businesses in the nearby factories and industrial premises in farie street cathcart road and harriet street
8217738 they can come in conveniently to post parcels and access other services
8217739 a major concern for me is the history of nasty accidents on mill street in the general area of the bankhead road junction where i understand there have been no less than four deaths in recent years
8217740 many pensioners and their home helps who wish to support the local shops in wallace street may have no choice but to spend their money in shops on the main street this will put at risk the future of all shops on wallace street
8217741 i also dont believe that the main street post office is geared up to deal with wallace streets customers longer queues and a poorer service will result
8217742 the most important thing is to save the post office
8217743 post office ltd constantly monitors and assesses the level of service in all our branches including independent mystery shopper checks on queuing the length of a queue at any one time depends on a number of factors the number of customers visiting the branch the number of staff serving the type of transactions and the time of day and month

8217748 red watch came on at 6pm and they had 26 turnouts all to do with flooding
8217749 the fire brigade came and pumped much of the water away but several houses in mill road and overton road have suffered flood damage
8217750 i assume the drains are just not equipped to deal with the volume of rainfall that we have had recently
8217751 over a six hour period from 3 9pm the operational control centre received and co ordinated the response to 127 flooding related calls for assistance there are thankfully no reports of any injuries or rescues being necessitated

8217755 i am completely shocked because you dont expect this sort of thing to happen we were quiet and everybody was getting ready to close and go home so i was out the front on my own it must have been close to midnight and i heard the door opening
8217756 i glanced round and saw two quite tall men standing there with scarves wrapped around their faces they just seemed to wait for a bit and then one of them demanded that i hand over our money
8217757 before i could really do anything one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting i think he fired around five or six shots and i tried to hide behind the counter but i felt something hit me in the chest
8217758 weve only been robbed once before that was nine years ago and was not nearly as bad as this im very worried because you just dont expect stuff like this to happen when you are at work
8217759 we are currently checking cctv footage to gain more information on the two suspects i would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident and witnessed anything suspicious to come forward if you have information which may assist contact my office on 01698 202600 alternatively contact crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymously

8217834 the new security plan should also include shiite cities like hwaider khirnabat and abara
8217835 the forces of the new security plan took all our weapons to the extent that we cannot fight al qaeda any more we are impotent
8217836 no shiite vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
8217837 we all know that shiite militias in baquba are a source of instability
8217838 influential shiite members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent

8217840 for senator bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
8217841 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
8217842 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
8217843 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
8217844 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone

8217858 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government

8217865 we find this unacceptable it only adds to the difficulty of solving the conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia
8217866 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
8217867 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

8217918 based on the original meaning of the constitution the framers intentions and subsequent legal and historical precedent senator mccains birth to parents who were u s citizens serving on a u s military base in the panama canal zone in 1936 makes him a natural born citizen within the meaning of the constitution
8217919 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8217920 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states
8217921 is where only the natural act of one being born in a place determines the status of ones citizenship with no additional stipulations necessary to influence that status
8217922 the clinical team dr z and r have expressed their views and to be fair to them dr z has perhaps a more stronger way presented concerns about delusional disorder
8217923 i have given a commitment to people in the 9 11 truth movement to continue requesting an apology until i have been given one
8217924 if i have not received an apology by august the 30th instead of protesting in auckland as i did last year i will be protesting outside whangarei base hospital
8217925 dr zubaran has perhaps in a more stronger way presented concerns about a delusional disorder he accepts that that is circumscribed and limited to specific issues of american policy

8217945 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8217946 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8217947 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

8218017 was ist dieses spiegel online von dem 2008 so viele leute geschrieben haben
8218018 genau das hatte lange einen guten ruf dann hatte es irgendwann einen unfassbar schlechten ruf aber nicht beim einfachen volk das hat sowohl die print als auch die online version geliebt spiegel online war das meistgelesene online medium zu dieser zeit
8218019 du musst wissen damals galten page impressions noch als heiliger gral im internet
8218020 na ja das waren jedenfalls spiegel und spiegel online 2008 m sste das jahr gewesen sein in dem sie gefragt haben ob das internet doof macht und ber twitterer und blogger gel stert haben
8218021 zum einen weil sie angst davor hatten zu recht wie wir heute wissen zum anderen weil sie sichergehen konnten dass fast alle blogger und twitterer dar ber schreiben w rden und wenn alle ber den spiegel schreiben sieht es noch ein bisschen l nger so aus als sei der spiegel relevant
8218022 warum haben denn immer alle blogger und twitterer dar ber geschrieben konnte denen das nicht egal sein
8218023 oma hat mir mal erz hlt wie sie vor vielen jahren mit anderen leuten ein atu autom
8218024 ich glaube ja wie sie sowas verhindert haben denen war immer egal was die anderen gedacht gesagt und in der zeitung geschrieben haben
8218025 tja die waren damals viel an der frischen luft um zu demonstrieren sauerstoff beruhigt wir sa en schlecht gelaunt in unseren b ros und haben uns dann halt aufgeregt ab 2009 hat aber keiner oder kaum noch einer auf den spiegel reagiert so dass sie 2010 aufgeben mussten
8218026 und was ist aus den ganzen leuten geworden die da gearbeitet haben
8218027 das war das lustigste als spiegel online zugemacht hat kam raus dass da nur drei verwirrte alte m nner gearbeitet haben ein taxifahrer ein drogenabh ngiger und ein mann dem ein wahnsinniger wissenschaftler ein br tchen anstelle seines gehirns eingepflanzt hatte alles andere kam aus computern

8218041 by september we hope to have cranes on the skyline
8218042 ray has large biceps and i dont ray has lots of fancy ink and i dont ray refrains from alcohol and i definitely dont but something i noticed this saturday we do have in common we bounce our legs when seated
8218043 this is really good im so glad no one sponsored lunch and i can eat
8218044 the fragrances are great and from a household safety and environmental point of view our products are better for people and their homes and better for the environment
8218045 over the last ten years people have become more conscious of design look at the success of the ipod as truly a mainstream brand it has achieved much deeper market penetration because of design and the greening of america has gone from a phenomenon that might be more true of places like marin county to one that is becoming more prevalent nationally
8218046 essentially what were doing is proving that business can be an agent for positive environmental change
8218047 the idea was that the people who are like me who are dark green are few and far between
8218048 method is being purchased by people who arent necessarily environmentalists theyre people who want to go green but dont know how or tried to and were frustrated we allow them to go green in a way that fits their lifestyle for me thats real environmental really moving the needle toward a better place
8218049 what a chief greenskeeper does is build greenness into every fabric of the business
8218050 traditional environmentalism is too stodgy anti business and too depressing i actually think business itself as the largest and most wealthy institution on the planet has the opportunity and the onus to create these changes
8218051 we think thats wrong designers should design high quality products that are green so the consumer doesnt have to think about it thats what we do
8218052 the point is that we look across all factors in the products life cycle
8218053 its a lot of work but we do the homework so people dont have to we combine that with a beautiful aesthetic of great fragrances and great product design its hip not hippie
8218054 are typically drawn to it for the first time because its a kind of a cool package and then theyll be happy with the way it works
8218055 the paradigm was its either green or it works or its either green or its high performance
8218056 theres more and more products like methods and the prius showed that an everyday passenger car that was green could actually pass somebody in traffic
8218057 we see ourselves as a little tugboat that can move some of these big supertankers into a greener space were not going to be the largest player but to some extent we find ourself being a thought leader
8218058 i would love to start a car company someday actually a personal transportation company because somebody needs to completely rethink the automobile and how we get from place to place

8218061 i want to know what exactly the proposal is mayo county council have already advertised for part 8 planning for the project
8218062 they already have plans for there how are we going to extract the plans
8218063 whatever happens in bellaghy is not of concern to us we are building four houses in charlestown for travellers living in the area we dont have to tell sligo county council about what is happening in mayo
8218064 this is not a halting site this is four houses that will house members of the travelling community in the area
8218065 the last thing anyone wants is somebody to get hurt
8218066 the area in which these activities are taking place is not a suitable place for water sports activity due to strong currents and shifting sands safety including safety of workers on the site members of the local community and any other members of the public is the first priority of the company at all times
8218067 its because of the downturn in the economy people are more nervous about spending

8218070 der steirische sp gesundheitslandesrat hirt ist mit seinen vorschl gen zur einf hrung eines eigenen unterrichtsfaches gesundheit erstens unglaubw rdig und zweitens beweist er wenig probleml sungskompetenz der rechungshof hat gerade erst der sp unterrichtsministerin ein schlechtes zeugnis f r den turnunterricht ausgestellt hirt solle lieber seine genossin zum handeln auffordern bevor er in der steiermark mit unausgegorenen ideen auf den plan tritt
8218071 die einf hrung eines eigenen faches gesundheit ist genau so berfl ssig wie die einf hrung des faches politische bildung ersteres k nne im biologie und chemieunterricht vermittelt werden zweiteres im geschichtsunterricht es ist wieder einmal typisch sp bei jedem auftretenden problem ein eigenes unterrichtsfach zu fordern anstatt die fragen in die bereits bestehende struktur logisch einzubinden
8218072 hirt solle mit seiner forderung nach einer verbesserung des turnunterrichts zu seiner genossin schmied gehen welche zwei jahre lang den verbesserungsw rdigen bereich des turnunterrichts ignoriert hat zu gunsten der gesamtschulexperimente die fp fordert hingegen die einf hrung einer turnstunde t glich und die vermittlung des wissens ber gesunde ern hrung im biologieunterricht
8218073 wozu diese nderung die kennzeichnung ist vertraut mit viel aufwand und geld werden hier unn tige irritationen der konsumentinnen und konsumenten heraufbeschworen
8218074 denn die konsumenten w rden verunsichert und jahre der umgew hnung brauchen
8218075 gut eingef hrte und den verbrauchern vertraute kennzeichnungen ndert man nicht
8218076 wir haben die opferhilfe die letzten eineinhalb jahre auf sehr stabile beine gestellt und haben die mittel von 3 5 millionen auf 4 5 millionen euro aufstocken k nnen
8218077 das sollten wir auf regierungsebene weiterverhandeln denn kollegin fekter und ich sind hier nicht so weit voneinander entfernt
8218078 der weisse ring hat den betrieb des opfernotrufes am 1 juli 2007 bernommen vorher wurde der notruf auf anwaltsebene gef hrt das gab probleme da opfer auch psychosoziale hilfe brauchen seit einem jahr betreuen 12 mitarbeiter zur h lfte psychologinnen und zur anderen h lfte speziell geschulte juristinnen die die betreuung von verbrechensopfern 24 stunden t glich bernommen haben es gab in der zeit vom 1 juli 07 bis 30 juni 08 12 500 anruferinnen die meisten kamen aus den bundesl ndern wien nieder sterreich und tirol
8218079 f r die opfer in der letzten zeit sehr viel getan wurde
8218080 so fehlen beispielsweise die gesetzlichen grundlagen f r die einrichtung von schutzzonen rund um die wohnorte von opfern von straftaten hier k nnte das bmi zum schutz der opfer sehr viel machen auch die verl ngerung der wegweisung auf 14 tage ist bei den gewaltschutzverhandlungen am bmi gescheitert

8218085 gesundheit ist eines der wichtigsten themen in der politik denn sie ist das h chste gut der menschen um gesund zu bleiben braucht es einerseits eine gute gesundheitspolitik die daf r sorgt dass die lebensbedingungen der menschen stimmen auf der anderen seite muss aber auch die motivation da sein auf sich selbst zu achten dazu wollen wir mit unserer aktion beitragen
8218086 bewegung ist ganz wichtig um gesund zu bleiben das im zentrum wiens darzustellen ist eine tolle idee da bin ich gerne mit dabei
8218087 bewegung ist gerade f r junge menschen besonders wichtig damit sie ein entsprechendes gesundheitsbewusstsein entwickeln bewegung und sport muss daher allen menschen zug nglich gemacht werden ohne soziale h rden
8218088 mach mit bleib fit ist unsere devise ich hoffe es gelingt uns mit dem wien walk viele menschen aller altersgruppen anzusprechen
8218089 der wien walk dient nicht blo dem wahlkampf sondern ist ein langfristiges projekt und so sollte auch die gesundheitspolitik sein
8218090 irrtum sofort korrigiert aber jetzt ist nach faymanns wahren absichten zu fragen
8218091 es ist schon interessant erst nachdem der seniorenbund gestern um 11 uhr 19 die ffentlichkeit informierte dass minister faymann pers nlich mitte juli in der kronenzeitung ank ndigte dass die fortsetzung der 7 euro seniorenaktion nicht geplant sei kam die nachricht dass es sie nun doch wieder gibt das freut uns im interesse der vielen seniorinnen und senioren es erkl rt aber nicht wieso mein kollege wohlmuth vom pensionistenverband als wahrheitswidrig bezeichnet was niemand in sterreich wissen konnte da es nachweislich erst stunden sp ter als apa ots um 15 uhr 24 bekannt gegeben wurde hat die sp hellseher
8218092 ich frage jetzt nicht wieso die 7 euro seniorenaktion stunden nach meiner kritik pl tzlich doch nicht abgeschafft wurde den tausenden senioren ist nur wichtig dass es sie wieder gibt
8218093 freuen wir uns jetzt ber das fortleben der guten bb aktion sollte ich in meinem kampf daf r in der wahl der worte nicht allen gefallen haben so bedauere ich das sterreichs seniorinnen und senioren k nnen aus faymanns eigenen ank ndigungen und dem ablauf der ereignisse selbst ihre schl sse ziehen positiv werden diese eher nicht ausfallen
8218094 der aktuelle rechungshofbericht zur bewegungserziehung an sterreichischen schulen best tigt die kritik welche die fp gestern am unterrichtsministerium ge bt hat 5 prozent der turnstunden wurden seit 2001 gestrichen trotz steigender sch lerzahlen die verantwortung hierf r liegt klar beim ministerium und den schulen
8218095 einerseits gibt es alarmierende studien ber bergewicht und mangel an bewegung andererseits wird nichts dagegen unternommen obwohl sp und vp die seit 2000 abwechselnd f r den schulischen bereich zust ndig waren st ndig etwas von angeboten an die jugend faseln die kritik am rechungshof in bezug auf das ministerium ist vielsagend der zustand der schulsportanlagen war dem bmukk nicht bekannt die pflege der au ensportanlagen war mangelhaft keine bildungsstandards lehrpl ne nicht berpr fbar effiziente steuerung unm glich anstatt mittels gesamtschulversuchen experimente an den sch lern durchzuf hren h tte ministerin schmied die letzten zwei jahre nutzen sollen diese missst nde zu beheben welche gehrer hinterlassen hat aber die erzwungene umsetzung der gescheiterten 68er versuche im bereich der p dagogik lag schmied mehr am herzen als die gesundheit der sch ler
8218096 die fp fordert daher die umsetzung der empfehlungen des rechungshofes gerade um den alarmierenden ergebnissen der aktuellen gesundheitsstudie entgegenzuwirken der zustand der sportst tten muss durch das ministerium endlich berpr ft werden m ngel sind zu beheben zudem m ssen berpr fbare bildungsstandards eingef hrt sowie die ausbildung der turnlehrer dahingehend verbessert werden als an den p dagogischen hochschulen erweiterte expertenkreise einbezogen werden dar ber hinaus fordert die fp eine turnstunde t glich welche entsprechend abwechslungsreich zu gestalten ist bei der gesundheit unserer kinder darf die regierung nicht den sparstift ansetzen
8218097 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8218098 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8218099 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8218100 tenho la os afetivos com a bahia desde a filmagem de central em milagres e vit ria da conquista
8218101 em linha de passe a trama se passa somente em s o paulo mas n o deixa de ser um filme de estrada os personagens est o em movimento constante
8218102 foi o contardo calligaris que me mandou essa not cia um garoto de 14 anos vivia procurando o pai nos coletivos at que aprendeu a dirigir um dia ele entrou na garagem e saiu com o nibus por tr s horas at ser preso passou 24 horas na febem e depois que foi solto roubou mais 30 nibus at fazer 18 anos hoje ele mec nico
8218103 era preciso encontrar rostos que n o fossem reconhecidos nas ruas que pudessem se misturar ao cen rio e se moldar s situa es
8218104 totalmente diferente do palco n o tem constru o de personagem tradicional tudo baseado nas nossas viv ncias e sentimentos tamb m muito dolorido mas como viver de verdade
8218105 a f tima praticamente pega a gente no colo e deixa tudo solto ela foi fundamental para o resultado do filme
8218106 ela nos colocou para dizer tudo o que nos incomodava na sandra corveloni a m e melhor atriz em cannes na frente dela falamos tudo e pensamos que ela nem viria no dia seguinte mas foi a partir dali que ela encontrou a personagem
8218107 a cleusa foi melhorada pela daniela eu provavelmente a transformaria numa her ina guerreira mas daniela a deixou mais humana falha
8218108 esse filme deveria ter outro ngulo o contracampo apresentado em outro longa mostramos personagens de uma classe social mais baixa em linha de passe e usar amos algumas pessoas que aparecem rapidamente para construir um outro filme
8218109 com as mudan as que tivemos de fazer no roteiro perdemos os pontos de liga o para o segundo filme
8218110 a situa o de falta de estado no rio criou uma oposi o muito batida entre morro e asfalto no rio que deixa tudo muito preto e branco sem meios tons se esse filme fosse no rio ele provavelmente se transformaria em uma coisa que voc s j viram
8218111 na poca de cidade de deus e not cias de uma guerra particular a situa o do rio n o passava nos telejornais e eles foram filmes muito importantes o problema a eterniza o dessa discuss o a sua transforma o em g nero cinematogr fico
8218112 n o quero fazer filme com gente morrendo cansei disso quero filme n o para matar as pessoas mas para salv las
8218113 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8218114 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8218115 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8218116 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8218117 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8218118 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8218119 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8218120 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8218121 o pensamento deste senhor faz voc pensar em todo o resto como
8218122 um p direito com tantos metros sete espa os entre colunas e um espa o livre e central
8218123 essa id ia de tens o sobre a calma fica mais clara se voc olhar as tr s s ries produzidas em diferentes formatos e processadas em diferentes suportes elas se relacionam o tempo todo existe uma conex o e uma valoriza o entre as frestas que as fotografias oferecem aquilo que n o est em nenhuma foto mas est presente entre elas esta a tensao
8218124 as pessoas olham de uma foto a outra fazem uma leitura circular v em a cidade noite e o asfalto a cabe a da gente muito esperta naturalmente linka e processa as imagens
8218125 os retratos s o muito pungentes na medida em que s o pessoas simples nos seus espa os de trabalho que n o remetem ao momento tecnol gico em que vivemos mas a momentos anteriores por outro lado tudo muito contempor neo em termos de fotografia
8218126 einfl sse auf wirtschaftlicher politischer und technischer ebene f hren zu einem zunehmenden wandel der internationalen medienlandschaft
8218127 in diesem kontext m ssen unternehmen und organisationen ihre pr tools und strategien weiterentwickeln um nach wie vor erfolgreich im ausland zu kommunizieren das internationale kommunikationsforum bietet den teilnehmern antworten zu aktuellen fragen rund um die ver nderungen der internationalen medienlandschaft und den daraus resultierenden anforderungen f r pressearbeit im ausland
8218128 der internetauftritt zur nationalratswahl 2008 ist ein wesentlicher bestandteil der umfassenden wahlinformation in wien
8218129 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8218130 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8218131 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8218132 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8218133 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8218134 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8218135 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8218136 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8218137 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8218138 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8218139 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8218140 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8218141 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8218142 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8218143 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8218144 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8218145 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8218146 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8218147 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8218148 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8218149 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8218150 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8218151 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8218152 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
8218153 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8218154 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8218155 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8218156 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8218157 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8218158 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8218159 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8218160 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8218161 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8218162 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8218163 who are open to doing something on the production side
8218164 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8218165 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8218166 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8218167 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8218168 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8218169 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8218170 s o salvador bahia de s o salvador a terra do nosso senhor do nosso senhor do bonfim
8218171 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8218172 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8218173 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8218174 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8218175 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8218176 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8218177 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8218180 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8218181 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8218182 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8218183 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8218184 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8218185 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8218186 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8218187 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8218188 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8218189 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8218190 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8218251 the criticism doesnt bother me what do they expect setanta readers comment of the day yes but refs have to be given power to stamp it out
8218252 thats the one thing we might have to think about but it would be cover because our two goalkeepers have shown already this season that they can play at this level
8218253 hes jones waiting to see a specialist but hes pretty optimistic and doesnt feel its as bad as the injury he had last year on the other hand
8218254 were having a think about whether weve got enough in terms of the squad
8218255 there may be areas that we feel we may need a bit more cover but weve got a very close knit squad and everyone is involved
8218256 theres not tens of millions but if as a club we feel something is right then were in a position to do that
8218257 the manner in which we made the changes did not affect the way we approached the game and played the game
8218258 it showed that we have got some strength in depth and i am delighted we got the crowd we did as it reflects both on us getting the ticket prices right and the type of football we play is attracting people to come

8218265 i had a first option and a second option that were not possible
8218266 i knew at the time that the club was doing everything possible to get these two players that i wanted or one of them who was not possible but for different reasons and when i was faced with the possibility of shevchenko i said yes because he is no doubts about it a player of high quality
8218267 he was like a prince in milan and in chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody is the same no statues everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove that he deserves to play so i think that maybe he lost some self confidence
8218268 you know the different factors a different life a different club a different league a different environment and step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8218269 i believe that in the future he will again be a player of high quality but maybe he needs the change a different challenge and a different environment to be happy
8218270 he is a very good player and to be fair i wish him to become again the sheva that everybody including myself admires
8218271 this is a hugely positive development for irish racing and were delighted to welcome the tote ireland pools into the ever growing betfair product stable
8218272 betfair customers will now have an even greater betting choice on irish racing and the irish tote pools will benefit from the wider reach that they now have allied to our existing voluntary payment to hri this is further indication of our serious commitment to irish racing
8218273 tote pools offer unique products and features which should be highly appealing to betfair customers
8218274 in consequence we anticipate this agreement will further enhance liquidity in the totes pools and help us further increase our contribution to irish racing

8218350 i have been not so positive on banking and realty so i would continue to ignore both these sectors at this juncture i am surprised at what dlf is doing first it announces a buyback and then it announces a qualified institutional placement qip of about rs 10 000 crore and intentions for that so on one hand you find the stock attractive and you announce a buyback and on the other hand if you are really in need of funds then why are you going in for buyback so these are the mixed signals which the dlf management is sending and that has sort of confused the investors and that is precisely the reason why we are seeing the stock crack 4 5 today i am not positive on any of the realty stock at this current juncture in fact i would rather buy a company with a good business good property and good asset
8218351 rs 1 300 on state bank of india sbi about rs 1 620 on bhel reliance industries has broken rs 2 200 and the last major support left here is rs 2 140 which we have played round with todays trade so theses are some key numbers i would be looking at very carefully if these stocks break these key levels then there is not much of an upside which is going to be there in the market one would possibly see a clear slice of 5 6 across the board
8218352 so these are stocks which i would keep in focus and levels specific as i said 4 250 4 200 thats the zone i would like to watch on the nifty very clearly so shorting opportunities are possibly developing i would wait it out till some key levels breakdown but if one is risk taker i wouldnt mind going in a small way here
8218353 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8218354 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8218355 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8218356 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8218357 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatise social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8218358 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8218359 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8218360 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8218361 whether its in a leadership role or in any other capacity i have made it clear to our group that i intend to stay for the duration of the cba talks
8218362 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8218363 thats the thing that sticks with you even if she can move on easily thats not as easy for everybody else
8218364 ive never been prouder of a democrat than i was tonight
8218365 she said it better than i ever could have everything i worked for and that she worked for would be at risk if we do anything less
8218366 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either
8218367 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
8218368 the way they are acting it must mean they are desperate
8218369 our rationale is that we dont want customers to get in a situation where they cant afford their outstanding commitment
8218370 the largest banks are trying to limit their exposure to housing in general
8218371 but the delinquency rates have been rising for the last several quarters
8218372 it does represent a hardship for customers and we recognize that
8218373 pnc has always managed its home equity lines of credit based upon a borrowers ability to pay and we continue to believe this is the most relevant predictor of repayment
8218374 this touched a nerve with me because i find it kind of underhanded
8218375 im stuck i dont know what im going to do with st joes i have to contact their bursar and see what kind of arrangements we can make
8218376 personalized books are the new new thing they build confidence and make the child the center of attention
8218377 my boy loves this book because he is the star
8218378 punj lloyd actually performed relatively well in q1 and based on those numbers and the projections the management has given we do expect the company to report about rs 16 kind of earnings and we do expect this company to grow at about more than 20 for the next three five years so even if you give at 20 p e multiple the stock should go upto about rs 320 and that is our target for punj lloyd at angel we do like paper companies hotels are looking very attractive and power cable companies are looking attractive so we have many of the ideas from these spaces
8218379 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8218380 the most important thing is to defend the rights of the people who live in and abkhazia
8218381 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8218382 russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8218383 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia fron the map
8218384 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force
8218385 international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8218386 well ive been talking about reducing the menu and now all of a sudden i want you to add salads
8218387 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8218388 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8218389 its encouraging to see the benefit of lower gas prices helping consumers a bit
8218390 in 1998 it seemed we would never reach the national average but the goal is now in sight
8218391 we think were doing a better job of teaching math and critical reading skills and not worrying so much about the sat
8218392 if we do that the sat will take care of itself
8218393 its his desire that this matter be handled as expeditiously as possible
8218394 you dont want him to call any witnesses on your behalf
8218395 our parents are older and they need their little boy
8218396 he was a really naive kid who wouldnt hurt a fly
8218397 by the plea agreement itself hes exposed himself to at least 20 years in prison
8218398 there is no sentence this court could impose that would not be a harsh sentence
8218399 nothing will ever be the same i no longer feel as safe in the world
8218400 one of the things our government wont tolerate and after 9 11 our citizens wont tolerate is trying to use americans as punching bags or targets for terrorist acts or mindless acts
8218401 if youre anything like the rest of us there will come a point in your life when you will truly regret what you did
8218402 if youre going to say anything the time to say it is now
8218403 it should be good were sort of working on ideas for setting lots of things on fire which is what we tried to do for festivals but theyve got loads of rules and they wouldnt let us
8218404 most of our ideas tend to involve setting something on fire so were trying to do it we couldnt do it as festivals so were trying to do it for this tour set roadies on fire and stuff and just see how they take it
8218405 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8218406 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8218407 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8218408 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8218409 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8218410 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8218411 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimising the hazards of behaviour
8218412 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8218413 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programmes which are important for saving lives
8218414 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as than things that are within their control
8218415 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8218416 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8218417 all products released and distributed to the market met all specifications
8218418 the fda warning letter is primarily related to concerns with documentation validation controls and investigations
8218419 you do not have a high level of assurance that the process is in a state of control and is capable of consistently producing a product that meets specifications
8218420 if it hadnt that would have meant people didnt care
8218421 i went back to see if they had reasonable objections
8218422 in light of st bartholomews historic importance to the african american people of camden
8218423 i think its a terrible shame about the pastor hes a great pastor
8218424 where else are you going to find a priest who truly understands what its like to be disabled
8218425 were a larger church and we have a more vibrant worship site than st aloysius we have people coming from 40 different zip codes from three counties due to our youth ministry music ministry and handicapped accessibility
8218426 once the parishes are merged most of the remedies under canon law are gone
8218427 the year 2008 will be drastically worse than 06 or 07
8218428 the numbers for this year will see a rise in poverty
8218429 i have to be honest with you 2006 and 2007 were bad but not as bad as this year
8218430 people are struggling more than in 06 theyre struggling double
8218431 they understand as long as they get the birthday cake
8218432 theyre coming here to save some money to pay their bus pass to fill their gas tank
8218433 the gap between the rich and poor will become bigger
8218434 and we expect the inequality numbers in pennsylvania to get worse
8218435 i expect poverty will go up in every one of philadelphias suburban counties when 2008 numbers are calculated
8218436 the decrease in philadelphias poverty seen between 2006 and 2007 will be erased
8218437 they are behind and their children may be terminated from the program because they cant pay 20 a month for day care
8218438 id go on interview after interview a resume without a college degree didnt help
8218439 unser mitgef hl gilt den angeh rigen und den kameraden des get teten soldaten
8218440 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8218441 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8218442 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8218443 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8218444 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8218445 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8218446 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8218447 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8218448 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8218449 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8218450 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8218451 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8218452 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8218453 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8218454 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8218455 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8218456 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8218457 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8218458 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8218459 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8218460 the software space still looks a little okay and i wont really rate it as a buy at these levels but i think sonata particularly can see an upside something like a 10 or 15 in the medium term so if i am invested into the stock i would hold on but looking at the whole market situation i wouldnt like to initiate a fresh long here and even for that matter the frontline tech stocks still look in a hold mode basically the trend looks sideways and it doesnt look like any big crack is coming in that space
8218461 chambers is looking for bargains im sure but its not the main driver he likes to consolidate during downturns and come out stronger
8218462 cisco has built itself around its acquisitions people will be thinking about what chambers will do a lot more now that the fiscal fourth quarter is over
8218463 regarding our cash on hand i can tell you that ciscos business strategy is to make investments for growth
8218464 cisco believes that its use of cash provides the company with the flexibility to make strategic investments in the business including r amp d acquisitions and share buyback
8218465 the use of litigation screenings in mass torts a formula for fraud
8218466 by my count approximately 1 500 000 potential litigants have been screened in the asbestos silica fen phen diet drugs silicone breast implant and welding fume litigations
8218467 have been designed to and did generate specious if not fraudulent claims
8218468 those who profit from this process most especially the doctors who have been paid hundreds of millions of dollars for their medical reports and services
8218469 defendants to discover all of the medical reports prepared by a litigation doctor for other screened claimants if that doctor prepared a medical report for a litigant before the court
8218470 she never liked the mayor and the mayor was lukewarm toward her
8218471 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
8218472 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8218473 then they seem to have come together to work together
8218474 the relationship was professional they both wanted to be able to obtain certain things for the success of both the city and the state
8218475 the mayor has defended his city the governor has defended the state

8218482 one of the great mistakes that we made in terms of political strategy before we broke for this latest recess was not taking on the republican party when they started talking about offshore drilling

8218527 gradually the knowledge of sins real nature the secret disorder wrought by sin and the ruin and desolation that sin brings into the soul unfold themselves to the mind 9
8218528 a turning the turning of the soul and all its faculties from sin to complete identification with the will of god 11
8218529 it is unlike attrition which from the latin attero means only a passing bruising of the soul inspired by the thought of the loss of heaven the eternal punishment of sin or the malice of sin in itself
8218530 contrition from the latin contero which means to rub and grind down the whole body is a wounding of the entire soul making it thereby sensitively tender and impressionable it is born of pure love of god for his own sake 11
8218531 this country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen and they knew one thing that a truly great country could go to war and at the same time act like it doesnt want to you people who are for the war you need the protesters because they make the country look like its full of sane caring individuals and you people who are anti war you need these flagwavers because if our whole country was made up of soft pussy protesters wed get taken down in a second thats why the founding fathers decided we should have both its called having your cake and eating it too
8218532 the exercise today will be looking at our command and control infrastructure our communication systems the use of specialised equipment cutting equipment which weve newly taken delivery of

8218541 the basic flaw in the neoconservative ideology is that democracy cannot be imposed on other people at the point of a gun
8218542 furthermore if neoconservatives came from an american tradition rather than a trotskyite tradition they would understand that america itself is not a democracy
8218543 well mr franklin what kind of government have you given us
8218544 madam we have given you a republic if you can keep it
8218545 furthermore mere elections are not what define americas unique form of freedom
8218546 it is our belief that mr wolfes death was as the result of foul play
8218547 the case continues to be actively investigated by our detective division we know there are persons who have information concerning the death of john wolfe jr and i ask that those persons come forward with the information our sheriffs office is offering a substantial reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person s responsible for wolfes death

8218549 decizia moscovei de a recunoaste regiunile separatiste abhazia si osetia de sud este un curs firesc al crizei din caucaz si un exemplu de reglementare a conflictelor inghetate
8218550 este un proces firesc care mai devreme sau mai tarziu trebuia sa duca la recunoasterea de catre rusia a independentei regiunilor separatiste abhazia si osetia de sud
8218551 transnistria nu va face parte niciodata din componenta republicii moldova
8218552 faptul ca voronin a fost chemat la soci la intalnirea cu medvedev exact in ziua in care parlamentul rus vota recunoasterea regiunilor separatiste din georgia este foarte sugestiv si demonstreaza ca rusia doreste sa impuna in republica moldova o reglementare in stilul sau cred ca in scurt timp putem sa ne asteptam la un kozak ii
8218553 sper ca autoritatile de la chisinau au inteles ca trebuie sa se astepte la un nou plan kozak si ca vor fi capabile sa i tina piept
8218554 dar cred ca miza pe o asemenea pozitie este una gresita pentru ca rusia se simte acum suficient de puternica pentru a impune propriile decizii fara a le negocia
8218555 evenimentele din ultimele trei saptamani ma fac sa cred ca prin neutralitatea republicii moldova rusia nu mai are in vedere doar relatia cu nato dar o
8218556 si nu cred ca presedintele medvedev are in vedere aceste lucruri atunci cand vorbeste despre necesitatea unei reglementari cat mai rapide a conflictului transnistrean
8218557 we are in dispute with major tour operator over our holiday when we booked we explained that we needed a child friendly pool there was no mention of the depth of the pool when we booked and this would of changed everything as our son is only a toddler the pool started at 1 4m also the villa was incredibly damp which we feared could cause a health problem we came home early without them offering us other accommodation and now will only apologise is there anything else we can do as we lost alot of money on this holiday honeymoon your advice would be most welcome
8218558 it is of great concern that pool safety issues continue to be reported to us in this case not only was the pool not suitable for their needs but the property was clearly a health hazard it is also clear that the resort representative and or the tour company failed to apply the rights within regulation 14 of the package travel regulations the rights arise where a significant proportion of services cannot be provided certain rights must be given to the consumer in this case the company clearly could not guarantee this familys health amp safety therefore the property and its facilities were not capable of being used the government and the eu commission must now ensure that in any future redrafting of the directive or regulations standard and automatic rights are given clearly and immediately to consumers

8218626 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8218627 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8218628 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8218629 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8218630 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8218631 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8218632 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8218633 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8218634 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy

8218637 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8218638 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference
8218639 we know the money is important but we are so close to the end of the transfer window it wont make a big difference
8218640 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game
8218641 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8218642 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over it is either being in the group stages or being out
8218643 it is going to be very difficult to pull back a two goal deficit especially against this side at home
8218644 but after the last game the players had a lot of belief that they could compete
8218645 ive actually extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8218646 im mentally strong enough to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8218647 but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8218648 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8218649 as you can see reliability is the key im not worried about the reliability of my car because for the past 18 months weve had phenomenal reliability
8218650 weve not really got any problems which means we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us
8218651 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8218652 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8218653 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8218654 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time

8218658 our experience of the downturn in the us housing market has enabled us to recognise the early signs of market weakness in the uk and act swiftly to position our uk housing business for a difficult trading environment

8218680 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8218681 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8218682 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8218683 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8218684 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8218685 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8218687 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8218688 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8218689 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8218691 ossezia del sud e abkhazia hanno motivi pi forti sia dal punto di vista giuridico che politico allindipendenza di quanti ne abbia avuti il kosovo

8218694 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8218695 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia

8218831 this was a horrifying experience that no woman should ever have to go through while we like to reassure women that incidents like this are relatively few and far between nonetheless a woman has been raped and the man responsible is still at large so women should be very careful when getting into taxis and make sure they are legitimate
8218832 our lads are on the ball for spotting rogue drivers and we are going to be even more vigilant now we are outraged that something like this can happen in stockport and the public and taxi drivers alike need to be vigilant before this cancer spreads
8218833 some people are doing it bogus cab driving to make money and theres sexual predators that do it and give taxi drivers a bad name they are opportunists it is absolutely disgusting you get a predator like this who is looking for women who are out on their own and vulnerable late at night
8218834 we are extremely concerned to hear of this serious incident we regularly carry out enforcement activities to ensure that only licensed drivers operate in stockport we would welcome any evidence from the public if they suspect that either a driver or vehicle is not licensed

8218858 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8218859 when the email arrived telling me that i had just won a load of finishing kit for my bike i guess i did not expect a great deal
8218860 but it soon dawned on me that i had won a top prize riding high uk offered brilliant service and had the parts out to me within a couple of days
8218861 element is not a brand i had heard of before but what was immediately clear was that they produce quality parts the stem is a work of art light as a feather at 100g and well finished with titanium bolts and nice graphics bars are also very light but seem perfectly strong enough for xc riding

8218874 we call them the green government when saddam was in power he went from the south of iraq to the north to check on the people
8218875 it is an ethnic government they dont care about iraqis it is all about your ethnic background your religion
8218876 lipids have an extremely wide range of applications which we are only just starting to appreciate because they are safely tolerated having been an essential part of the human food chain for millions of years they can be used as carriers for drugs
8218877 under this process we would marry an existing api with a lipid carrier making it more efficacious at lower doses
8218878 at equateq we have devised methods to mimic this natural process of metabolism and thus have been able to synthesise these potent compounds for use as apis our explorations so far show that taking only small amounts of these novel compounds can be extremely effective without any debilitating side effects
8218879 we are able to do all the key processes of lipid manufacturing such as esterification hydrolysis distillation and refining
8218880 we would then use the fractionated material as feedstock for our second key expertise preparative hplc we have the capability to deliver commercial quantities of up to 99 per cent pure fatty acids by using this method these concentrates are of great use for the pharmaceutical industry or for researchers who want to explore with confidence that they are using the highest grade lipid compounds
8218881 the inspection found that we comply with the eu guidelines on gmp medicinal products for human and veterinary use part ii basic requirements for active substances used as starting materials section 19 apis for use in clinical trials
8218882 the mhra approval falls under the emea and so has validity throughout the eu you may also be aware that there both the mhra and the fda have embarked on a pilot programme to explore ways in which both bodies can recognise and accept the others inspections so certainly the mhra approval will carry weight with our american customers
8218883 regarding future approvals i think my staff will have a well deserved breather after the successful mhra certification which is for our manufacturing processes in general not for a specific product i would anticipate that we will be applying to both the emea and the fda as part of applications for specific apis
8218884 we intend to do both develop in house apis and do work on a contract basis for any pharma company that wants to stay at the cutting edge of the lipid space
8218885 the bottom line is that this all comes down to resources pharma development can yield great rewards but does cost a lot of money
8218886 but we also see massive potential in other areas some of which are just too large for us to take on so we would certainly be open to license these compounds to any pharmaceutical company with an interest in pursuing a new and remarkable method of treatment and we could of course make commercial quantities of specific synthetic lipids on contract if a company required that
8218887 capacity depends on the quality of the feedstock but for fractionation we can deliver in the low hundreds of tons of material per annum for hplc we can deliver about 1 ton a month of ultra pure fatty acids
8218888 but all our processes are scalable and we anticipate that we will be adding capacity as demand increases the wonderful thing about being based in the western isles is that we have plenty of space on site to expand into
8218889 sustainability is key if all people followed their governments health advice and took at least 1 gram of omega 3 actives per day mostly in the form of fish oil the oceans would soon be empty of fish life
8218890 there are already pressures on the key fish sources that provide omega 3 oil feedstock be it tuna for hi dha or sardines for hi epa and 18 12
8218891 it is my view that the acceptability of gmo material will become more widespread
8218892 so we think that equateq is well placed to benefit from both these projections being able to process feedstock from any fatty acid source and already having resolved some of the key obstacles in lipid synthesis
8218893 i do not have an overall value but the biggest lipid pharma success is pronova biopharmas omacor in the eu marketed as lovaza in the us particularly since its purchase by glaxosmithkline last december which indicates the massive potential for lipid treatments as both effective and side effect free lipid concentrates have a greater penetration as apis in japan
8218894 we are quite unique in being a lipid api company there are lipid suppliers who process oil on a much larger scale than we do but more for the nutritional sector and there are specialised laboratories that can synthesise esoteric lipids but only on a microgram scale

8218941 i feel good and ready to play the game against the germans i was given time to rest
8218942 i was the last to rejoin the squad but i think they are doing well we know that we have the scoreline against us but we can come back in order to win we have to keep our calm
8218943 if we play the football that we like to in the vicente calder n we can pass through without problems we are all very committed
8218944 i am very happy to have won the gold medal at the olympic games we had a very good squad very close and in the end earning the gold was the best
8218945 no your government requires you to get a visa in advance you have to go back to the paraguayan consulate to get a visa
8218946 i had planned to go to the inauguration of president lugo
8218947 no he could get in trouble when he arrived and hed certainly get in trouble when he left paraguay
8218948 well well have to see wont we but he has promised to give his presidential salary to the poor thats a first for this country maybe theyll rob less than all the others
8218949 soldiers will never again be sent out to kill campesinos
8218950 weve organized on issues that are relevant to people especially the poor people of paraguay who are the majority that is paraguay is a poor country i mean its rich in the sense that you can drop a seed anywhere and it will grow but the people here are very poor
8218951 here in paraguay there are only two classes of people those with shoes and those without thats it theres no middle class and the poor are the poorest in the world
8218952 of six million paraguayans a million and a half live outside the country working in argentina or spain or elsewhere
8218953 im the mother of one of the founders of that party
8218954 what we want is work and dignity for the people of paraguay thats what were fighting for
8218955 and so today were celebrating this is a celebration of the people of paraguay because we won not with guns but with votes a battle against a party of genocide
8218956 ill give you an example a friend of mine is in the hospital today with her malnourished child its a hospital with everything you could ask for but the baby is allergic to wheat and requires a special kind of milk the milk costs 80 000 guaran s 20 a liter where is she going to get that kind of money were hoping that tomorrow president lugo is going to do what he really has to do
8218957 were all going to be with him in this struggle because we dont want any more of this suffering
8218958 it was the young people who founded the party all very young people and they believe in socialism were big and were growing there are 6 000 militants in asunci n but were a national presence and have chapters all over the country
8218959 each neighborhood has a nucleus of the party but we organize in popular assemblies around the needs that the local people have thats how we hope to build the socialism of the 21st century
8218960 i refuse to live in a country where some cant sleep because of fear and others cant sleep because theyre hungry
8218961 the party is over and its time to get to work today hope has won may it continue for a long time to come

8218965 i mean he only has one job busansky said late tuesday night
8218966 one job to do its to get that vote in and to get it out and to count it accurately and im appalled
8218967 oye n ufrago no ten as otra cosa mejor en qu entretenerte

8218972 its a couple who live there and they have three kids they are very nice and they stop to say hello
8218973 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
8218974 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve

8218977 at this point it rices visit doesnt matter because they are going to be out of office
8218978 in some way they are making a desperate effort to be remembered
8218979 this rush to finish something that could not be finished in weeks or months could be catastrophic they can only accomplish it by leaving loads of things unresolved
8218980 without examining public opinion the balance of force in fatah the state of the leadership of abu mazen mahmoud abbas who will probably be out of office as well next year it is not responsible to rush a peace accord
8218981 they dont look at palestinian politics which includes what is aired on the radio taught in school and preached in the mosque all of which makes up public opinion
8218982 what people say in arabic is really what is important
8218983 abu mazen is in many ways relatively moderate but he is not moderate on the palestinian refugees right of return which is very close to his heart
8218984 israel wants to show it is for peace and it wants to keep the west bank quiet so it can focus on other issues it has such as gaza iran hezbollah
8218985 our assumption is that we will be under a heavy barrage of missiles in a future conflict
8218986 this applies to all of the air force bases in the south and the north

8218989 with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance of succeeding
8218990 have to continue working with the administration of president george w bush in order to reach an agreement
8218991 have to exert every effort within the coming period and not to loose any opportunity to reach an agreement
8218992 share the belief that an agreement can be reached between israel and the palestinians by the end of 2008
8218993 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
8218994 and in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed theyre positioned somewhat closer together over this period of time
8218995 discussed reaching a full peace deal and not a partial one that postpones other issues
8218996 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
8218997 any attempt to bridge gaps which might be premature to bridge or any attempt to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes
8218998 i believe that a timeline is important but whats more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
8218999 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
8219000 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8219001 undoubtedly a main obstacle in the road of the peace process
8219002 reject all the settlement activities in principle because they contradict with the agreements and the roadmap plan and the objectives

8219054 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8219055 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8219056 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8219057 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8219058 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8219059 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8219060 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8219061 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed

8219067 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8219068 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8219069 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8219070 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8219071 no one works for someone we all just work together
8219072 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8219073 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8219074 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8219075 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8219076 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8219077 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8219078 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8219079 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8219080 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8219081 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8219082 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile

8219089 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8219090 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8219091 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8219092 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8219093 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8219094 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8219095 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8219096 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8219097 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8219098 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8219099 we were here first its not fair for them to have a job
8219100 he doesnt drink he doesnt smoke he takes care of his kids
8219101 so much out there is being done because of my religion
8219102 whose malicious bias against muslim americans and their organizations is well known
8219103 the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them
8219104 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8219105 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8219106 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8219107 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8219108 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8219109 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8219110 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8219111 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8219112 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8219113 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8219114 this is a planning took where all things are going
8219115 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8219116 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8219117 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8219118 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8219119 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8219120 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8219121 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8219122 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8219123 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8219124 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8219125 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8219126 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8219127 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8219128 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8219129 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8219130 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8219131 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8219132 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8219133 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8219134 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8219135 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8219136 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8219137 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8219138 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8219139 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8219140 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8219141 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8219142 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8219143 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8219144 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8219145 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8219146 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8219147 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8219148 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8219149 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8219150 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8219151 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8219152 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8219153 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8219154 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8219155 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8219156 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8219157 theyre not relying on his celebrity factor or the coolness of obama they have invested real resources into getting out the youth vote

8219170 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8219171 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8219172 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8219173 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8219174 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8219177 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8219178 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8219179 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8219180 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away

8219216 we now pay four times more for defense three times more for gasoline and home heating oil and twice what we paid for health care
8219217 we have now narrowed down the vice presidents problems on this thing to one issue and that is whether we should include these health maintenance organizations like edgar kaisers permenente thing
8219218 let me ask you you know im not too keen on any of these damn medical programs
8219219 edgar kaiser is running this permanente thing for profit and the reason he can do it i had edgar kaiser come in and talk to me about this and i went into some depth all the incentives are toward less medical care because the less care they give them the more money they make

8219298 ive been there so i know what we can expect i was there with
8219299 physically they are strong but skilful and organised but okay our boys are used to it
8219300 this time we have really infused a lot of our influences like motorhead and wasp meets racer x again with our own brand and power we have just finished tracking the album with mixing to start this weekend with the writing process we have had more time as a band and also focus on more shredding from stu
8219301 t he metal world needs more bands this willing to throw out the rule book and go wherever their mad muse takes them
8219302 check this one out before you die its definitely worth it
8219303 its sophisticated progressive music thats driven by a rocknroll feel but i really think that my music sometimes slips from those definitions and creates a new entity the main influences range from the progressive rock groups of the seventies such as yes rush pink floyd deep purple and king crimson to newer metal bands like metallica megadeth porcupine tree dream theater and many more
8219304 his mix makes the album what it is he understands music and knows how to handle it to get it where it belongs

8219316 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8219317 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8219318 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8219319 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8219320 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8219321 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8219322 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8219323 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8219324 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8219325 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8219326 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8219327 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8219328 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8219329 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8219330 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8219331 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8219332 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8219333 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8219334 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8219335 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8219336 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8219337 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8219338 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8219339 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8219340 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8219341 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8219342 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8219343 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8219344 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8219345 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8219346 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8219347 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8219348 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8219349 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8219350 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8219351 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8219352 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8219353 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8219354 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8219355 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8219356 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8219357 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8219358 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8219359 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8219360 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8219361 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8219362 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8219363 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8219364 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8219365 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8219366 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8219367 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8219368 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8219369 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8219370 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8219371 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8219372 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8219373 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8219374 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8219375 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8219376 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8219377 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8219378 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8219379 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8219380 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8219381 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8219382 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8219383 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8219384 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8219385 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8219386 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8219387 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8219388 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8219389 at one point i argued with the decision but i am still about three weeks away
8219390 i have been running routes and i have not had any drawbacks which is good
8219391 but at the same time thats a roster spot and guys have to go out there and go to war
8219392 i just want to know why they would treat another human being that way
8219393 im happy with the ruling it was a total win for us
8219394 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8219395 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8219396 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8219397 ive never seen any jurisdiction in the united states where those figures are that close
8219398 we dont have neighborhoods like the village or chelsea there is only one community center for gays in the bronx
8219399 most of the gay men in this area are very self obsessed and only concerned about their careers the gym and clubs on the weekend so having children is the furthest thing from their mind
8219400 we found the amount of parking placards outweighed the number of parking spots for the agency as a whole by about 6 or so to 1
8219401 ultimately we convinced them not to reduce any spots would i rather they not changed anything of course but rather than going to court to work out the change we negotiated
8219402 its difficult enough when you commute from very far away
8219403 these things that have come out im embarrassed but im not ashamed of anything
8219404 it was a tough breakup i was head over heels in love
8219405 this is absolutely disgusting they have sent pis into every facet of my personal life
8219406 this was the only private embarrassing secret of my life in a way its a huge weight off my shoulders
8219407 i told them im just walking by im not the cops
8219408 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it i promise you that
8219409 i suppose i could have worn the shirt but it would have caused a bloodbath
8219410 the image of michelle obama with her kids softens her immediately
8219411 the picture of him communicating with his kids in front of millions of people makes it hard to say he doesnt share traditional values
8219412 blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8219413 we were going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8219414 johnson began to cry and admitted that adolf had threatened to kill obama on a prior occasion
8219415 we continue to focus attention on our citys middle schools because that is where the rubber hits the road for many of our students
8219416 this year there were exams that were watered down to the point where you only had to get one third of the questions right to get a passing score
8219417 it may take a few days for the convention effect to percolate through to the american public
8219418 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8219419 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant american somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because thats a debate i welcome
8219420 we can confirm that all the plane passengers have been freed by the hijackers
8219421 im at a loss for words im ecstatic about it
8219422 at the same time i have mixed feelings her mother made some bad choices
8219423 i wanted my daughter to have a mother and a father
8219424 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8219425 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so

8219429 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements
8219430 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8219431 i think average voters are turned off by the tearing down
8219432 but not by the building up i think voters like to see people coming together
8219433 hillary at points disappointed me on how far she went to try to tear barack down but i take my hat off to her for how shes handling it now
8219434 it depends how much you want to win all that early stuff was intramural sports now were into the real season and in the end she wants him to win i believe that
8219435 the question is does that tough clinton obama primary make obama tougher a lot of hillary supporters are saying yes
8219436 what is more unique about this is that they are actually building it into the curriculum
8219437 were trying to use the city and the metropolitan region as a way of developing real life encounters that will enhance whatever is being taught in class people learn best when they are experiencing something
8219438 its a step in the right direction it just needs more clarification
8219439 if being in philadelphia is part of the appeal of a temple education then rounding out the core curriculum in the opportunities and challenges in philadelphia is a superb learning context
8219440 that only helps us in terms of revitalizing and bringing fresh blood in
8219441 the course is structured so that we lecture on underlying principles related to matter and energy and we try to make it more comprehensible through field trips
8219442 its really great to see local examples of these concepts
8219443 for the most part faculty have made their peace with that and are supportive of the program
8219444 replying to questions raised by the elected representatives i told them that the state government had already appointed a sub committee of ministers under my chairmanship to raise additional resources for the irrigation projects and that the committee had recommended to the state cabinet that rs 350 crore be raised for irrigation projects through the additional stamp duty the cabinet will take a decision soon on the recommendation
8219445 the finance and planning department is currently looking into the amount of the hike
8219446 i always thought for the city council a three term limit made more sense

8219462 i was so angry about the way this thing centrepointe has come down
8219463 but anger is one of the stages of grief and im in grief we were so insensitive to our history and our young people

8219465 dressed in victorian era mourning clothing i will create a dollhouse size replica of the buildings during that time
8219466 i will walk around the block while creating paper flowers on stems and other mementos that will be left as i pass the replica the arrangement will hopefully evoke symbolic attachments to the process of mourning being a form of memory and a spiritual rebirth of those things gone
8219467 i have a great appreciation for this history and the architecture that has been lost
8219468 it was a dive bar it wasnt the same genre of people you run into at other bars you ran into people from all different groups i was more comfortable there than anywhere else

8219505 yes you might ask also why do people have to do a nude shot to evoke such emotions well thats what works simple as that thats what hits home to so many people i might also ask you why you blog why do you feel the need to share your opinions with others it comes down to the same thing we are all looking for something or someone we can identify with be it in a blog opinion or a naked body so we know were not alone

8219522 the international cup is an excellent platform to build sport and business links with india
8219523 i would like to congratulate the afl for this initiative the government will continue to work with them to assist in promoting our great game overseas
8219524 afl india was formed 18 months ago in kolkata this is a great opportunity for australian football to become a sporting option for indian boys and girls we look forward to the games growth in the years ahead
8219525 i have been working with the indian team to hone their skills on the football field the side shows great promise and as the sport gains popularity in india more people will want to be involved and this will lift the standard of play
8219526 we see it as a great opportunity to introduce australian rules football to india
8219527 indians are now the number one immigrants into the state of victoria and indian overseas students are the second largest cohort of international students in the state we are encouraging students and immigrants to play afl as it will help them integrate with the community
8219528 presently the afl and austrade australian trade commission are partnering to deliver exhibition games in india
8219529 we are planning to have the game played between two afl clubs before an attending crowd of approximately 10 000 people and have the match televised both in australia and in india

8219550 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimising the hazards of behaviour
8219551 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8219552 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programmes which are important for saving lives
8219553 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8219554 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8219555 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority

8219618 there was this trend where the amount of homework was equated with how rigorous your program was
8219619 what youre seeing in spring branch and in other places is a backlash to that
8219620 im not a believer in sending home 25 algebra questions as homework when five would let the teacher know if the student gets it

8219623 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8219624 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8219625 one possible explanation is that while women are breastfeeding they arent menstruating and so their hormones arent cycling
8219626 helps explain why some women are at higher risk and also why certain therapies are not effective against these more aggressive forms of breast cancer

8219678 following the delays and data entry problems experienced earlier this year it is vital that the reviews process is robust effective and retains the confidence of schools in the outcomes of the tests
8219679 i am pleased that edexcel are assisting us in this work the quality measures put in place this year gave a greater number of checks on markers adherence to the mark scheme
8219680 however if schools have evidence that the mark scheme has been misapplied they should apply for a review and the naa will ensure the application is properly evaluated and where necessary scripts remarked

8219702 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8219703 just watch em if you were a player youre looking over in that other dugout youll feel a certain type of way you try to find something on any team but especially these guys
8219704 should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively
8219705 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country and of course in the united nations such a decline is especially notable among ruling groups and the intellectual elite they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists
8219706 every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the pursuit of happiness so why and for what should one risk ones precious life in defense of common values and particularly in such nebulous cases when the security of ones nation must be defended in a distant country
8219707 people in the west has acquired considerable skill in using interpreting and manipulating law if one is right from a legal point of view nothing more is required nobody might mention that one could still not be entirely right and urge a willingness to show restraint or sacrifice everybody operates at the extreme limits of those legal frames a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
8219708 legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of legions of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
8219709 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born out of a humanistic concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature
8219710 the press too enjoys the widest freedom but what use does it make of this freedom the press has become the greatest power within the western countries more powerful than the legislature the executive and the judiciary one would then like to ask by what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible how many hasty immature superficial and misleading judgments are expressed every day confusing readers and without any verification thus we see terrorists made into heroes or secret matters pertaining to the national defense publicly revealed or shameful intrusion into the privacy of people under the false slogan everyone has the right to know everything
8219711 mere freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds some new ones we have placed too much hope in political and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life
8219712 youve got to stop being so bleeping cool get that through your bleeping heads

8219733 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

8219738 the problem is that our brains are scrambled our thought processes
8219739 we are chronically caught within the programmes of a self perpetuating pattern which prevents us from either seeing our true predicament or doing anything about it the grail legends indicate a way of breaking through that programme the heroic act today of giving up our lives for something bigger than ourselves is the only way back to simply allow the greater part of what has been severed within us to fill the vacuum left when the false self is left behind

8219747 brazil plans to ask the world trade organization to impose punitive sanctions worth billions of dollars against the united states for handing out illegal cotton subsidies its foreign minister said wednesday
8219748 a precise sanction figure was still being calculated and had yet to be formally lodged with the world trade organization arbitration panel brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said in the australian capital canberra
8219749 it will certainly be in the area of billions amorim said its certainly very high because the harm that these subsidies cause is very big
8219750 brazil asked the wto on monday for approval to impose up to us 4 billion in annual sanctions against american goods and services according to two trade officials who were not authorized to speak to media and demanded anonymity
8219751 washington can still ask the wto to authorize less in sanctions than brazil is seeking and said tuesday that any u s payments were not enabling american producers to undersell their foreign competitors
8219752 amorim the first brazilian minister to visit australia since prime minister kevin rudds government was elected in november last year has discussed with australian officials how the two agriculture exporting nations can revive the wto doha round of trade liberalization negotiations
