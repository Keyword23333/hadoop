340064 and believe me london is by no means at the forefront of cycling
340065 you have to be much more careful here than in london because the drivers here are so much more hostile
340066 apparently he is quite hostile to cyclists but i cant understand how anyone in this day and age can be like that particularly with petrol prices going up
340067 i think you need a serious education campaign its a matter of creating a culture where its acceptable to cycle
340068 once you start putting in the infrastructure like bike lanes and signs and give cyclists priority then drivers will accept them

340079 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
340080 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
340081 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat

340085 im now in the role that i used to sell to when i was on the other side of the fence
340086 i look at the vendors we select as long term partners rather than one off sales
340087 if they cant talk intelligently i have very little use for them
340088 theres always that subtle pressure to shoot business their way because theyre writing checks
340089 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
340090 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
340091 cios are being tasked with developing processes to meet strategic business goals so think about which industries are of interest to you
340092 additional investments of several hundreds of millions of dollars are worth the cost given the opportunity to participate in a market where the opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of dollars
340093 theres a new computer that is available up in the cloud and it is going to be transformational in terms of how people write and build solutions
340094 the problem that we are trying to solve is of a broader scope and is different than what you have seen our competitors come out with
340095 not too bad today this morning was the first time i have driven here since the track configuration was changed so i was finding out what its like in a formula 1 car that went okay this afternoon it was the usual programme of evaluating the tyres with different fuel loads the track rubbered in quite a lot towards the end and as i did low fuel runs earlier in the session this did not show in our later lap times i was struggling a bit on the option which i had expected as this track changes a lot if you dont have a major problem with the car its best to leave it alone and see what happens on the second day otherwise you make changes to the car which are not appropriate for the saturday conditions you have to be patient
340096 i had hydraulic problems in both sessions a shame because i lost a lot of track time and fridays work is very important i hardly ran at all and therefore we are lacking information which will be a handicap for the rest of the weekend obviously this means the data from the other car will be twice as important as usual i will try and learn from sebastien but relying on your team mate is never as good as finding your own way around the track hopefully i can catch up a bit tomorrow morning
340097 overall we had a good day today which enabled us to further understand the new rear suspension that we will be racing for the first time this weekend we made some positive changes after the morning session to improve the car as i was not happy with the balance when we had very low grip at both ends the changes ensured that the car was a lot more responsive this afternoon and an improvement over how it has felt for much of this season our long run pace is looking okay but we have further work to do over one lap as the balance is not quite there yet
340098 it has been a challenging day today which we expected as we continue the set up work with our revised rear suspension and new aero parts once the track had improved this morning we worked on getting the right balance on the car and conditioning the tyres unfortunately we struggled with understeer and we need to look at the data closely this evening to confirm our direction before qualifying as the lack of overtaking opportunities here makes it important to get a good grid slot
340099 in the beginning it wasnt good at all i guess many drivers had trouble with graining so i dont think i was the only one but i found the balance of my car really poor we made several changes during both sessions but they didnt lead to the progress we wanted for the very last outing we then made major changes and luckily this proved to be a step in the right direction im happy we tried this because we now know a lot more
340100 we did the usual friday programme we evaluated the tyre compounds and worked on the cars set up in order to find out how the car and the tyres behave on this track we will now analyse todays data and prepare for saturday
340101 it was a productive first day of practice as usual we concentrated on race preparation the focus was on the tyre selection in budapest the two softest tyre compounds will be used now we are going to analyse the data we have collected this will be the base for our race strategy
340102 the track was very dusty this morning so we took our time before starting our run programme once again the car felt good even though i encountered quite a lot of traffic during both sessions this afternoon i also got to try the revised aero package for the first time it definitely seemed to make the car better balanced which is very encouraging
340103 another positive day for us the car started the day pretty strongly but we were able to keep improving it throughout both sessions this afternoon i was able to find a particularly good balance and focused on conserving the tyres rather than going for a laptime i had a little bit of graining but things look very promising for tomorrow
340104 today we ran two more or less trouble free sessions save for a few traffic issues this morning which arent unusual on this circuit having said that those traffic issues werent sufficient to disrupt our programme unduly the aero package weve developed for this race appears to have delivered the predicted results and the performance of the car is encouraging so far
340105 a good and constructive start to the weekend we simulated race conditions and both lewis and heikki posted fast and consistent laptimes with more rubber on the asphalt the conditions will change tomorrow so it is too early to judge precisely where we are compared to the competition
340106 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
340107 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
340108 fridays results are always difficult to evaluate as one doesnt know what fuel loads the other teams are running and this is even more the case here in budapest where the tyres show signs of a lot of graining on the first day in fact only the performance over the first lap can be considered a valid indication before waiting several laps before the tyres clean up again and one can return to showing an acceptable pace we got through all our planned programme and the new parts we have brought here seem to be working in the right direction now we have to analyse the date to be as well prepared as possible for the rest of the weekend
340109 as usual here in hungary it was a difficult friday because of the dusty circuit
340110 the morning went well for me on the dirty track surface and we had no problems with the car
340111 todays sessions went very smoothly and we were able to get through a lot of work on aerodynamics and set up
340112 it was a typical day of practice with a lot of laps covered and lots of data to analyse this evening to be ready for tomorrow overall we improved the car and we are moving in the right direction we still have a few things to improve but if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape
340113 our free practice programme went well and we have made progress the car was reacting well to the different set up solutions that we tried and so i am quite satisfied with the days work the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
340114 it was a very productive first day here in hungary on this circuit where qualifying is particularly important its no secret that our fuel load was slightly lower than normal but even so we look competitive our main focus was to understand the tyres and in particular the effect of graining all in all it was a successful day for us
340115 this is a track we know well and so our main focus today was to concentrate on the set up of the cars there were not any problems which allowed us to make good progress with our programme and the results from the first day of practice are rather encouraging its difficult to know exactly where we are relative to our competitors because the impact of carrying fuel here is significant but it was important to complete our programme which we have done
340116 weve got some work to do tonight to try and work out where we can find some more pace in the car we had a good run in terms of laps completed but it would always be nice to be a bit quicker well be back tomorrow and will do our best
340117 a normal friday for us today making our tyre comparisons and getting used to the conditions i think its going to be very tight again in the mid group but well see how tomorrow goes
340118 we werent able to pull it together with the offensive team
340119 the defence played well and the special teams didnt play well and neither did the offence and when you lose two out of three its difficult its just unacceptable the way we played tonight
340120 hes got a lot of potential and a good attitude and thought process ive followed him since his days at boise state
340121 youre playing a team thats giving up the rush and this wasnt good enough the average was there but the issue is the consistency tonight he dropped the punt and fumbled two balls never mind the yardage
340122 when youre the no 1 team defensively year in and year out teams have six months to watch what we do
340123 now i think weve figured out what people are trying to do to us were even now but we need to get a step ahead we just have to load the box up and take away first down and then on second down we get sacks and interceptions
340124 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

340130 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt
340131 had found another man and he did not want to have any kids around
340132 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
340133 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
340134 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
340135 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
340136 a lot of other people might have been in the can if certain things had gone different
340137 im sorry while i certainly like you as a friend i cannot yet say that i love you but perhaps with time and intimacy i will grow to love you
340138 listen to them children of the night what music they make
340139 you will not remember what i show you now and yet i shall awaken memories of love and crime and death
340140 its a perfect night for mystery and horror the air itself is filled with monsters
340141 even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright
340142 oh relax now that weve seen the last of dracula the wolf man and the monster theres nobody to frighten us anymore oh thats too bad i was hoping to get in on the excitement who said that allow me to introduce myself im the invisible man
340143 when i think of it my fingers turn to fists call me crazy hold me down make me cry get off now baby it wont be long till youll be lying limp in your own hand
340144 i may be soft in your palm but ill soon grow hungry for a fight and i will not let you win my pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will disprove your faith in man
340145 im your crowbar if thats what i am so far until you get out of this mess and i will pretend that i dont know of your sins
340146 every woman adores a fascist the boot in the face
340147 and if it gets too late for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so its ok dont need to say it
340148 with defeat as the impetus jackson responded to rough terrain by relieving the trainer of his duties though bottom line somehow someway it all involves money said the fighters friend
340149 rampage demanded silence when he wasnt offering words of faith he spoke of a wolf in sheeps clothing and people aligned with the devil mentally he wasnt there said the source it was almost as if he was possessed he heard voices he thought he was a god three days later rested and nourished rampage was reunited with friends he would still make comments that were slightly weird said jacksons longtime associate you could tell that he wasnt all the way there but each day you could tell he was better against lawyers advice jackson has gone out several times fan requests for autographs at a local mall have been happily fulfilled his only other trips are to outpatient treatment which he attends daily he knows what he went through
340150 he knew he had an emotional breakdown that led to a mental breakdown
340151 under the gun to draw ratings the company is attempting to put together middleweight akiyama against heavyweight mirko cro cop the countrys most popular foreign fighter
340152 i was asked by the members of media if im willing to fight overeem since he challenged me twice already i watched dream 5 and i was happy to see a strong heavyweight match up on the card i have no doubts that dream will put more match ups like that in the future it was a very good performance by alistair i must say im happy to accept his challenge and im looking forward to this fight as i believe that we can deliver an entertaining fight now its up to dream to make this fight happen im ready to face my challenger on the next show already
340153 i spoke with my manager now and he said they called him and said it would depend on octobers event i might face mark coleman on december but nothing has been signed yet he wanted to face me on november and i really wanna face him i hope this time he dont run from me he said no to me a couple of times but i believe now it will happen
340154 i really havent put much thought to mauricio shogun rua lately i have no clue what hes talking about claiming i ducked him if he really needs to stir something up i really dont give a expletive he can stir something up
340155 ive never picked my opponents since the beginning i dont go around picking my opponents i let the promoter do that whoever the promoter picks thats obviously who the fans want to see
340156 if a fight with rua is something that interests the fans if thats something that the ufc wants to make happen i dont go around turning down fights shogun is fine
340157 as far as shogun being on the top of my list hes not
340158 i have no reason to want to fight his ass i already fought him and beat him as far as him indicating the fact that ive ducked him thats wishful thinking on his part
340159 my retina was damaged possibly detached and the laceration was pretty long it was basically from one end of my eye to the other they did laser surgery that took about two hours put some stitches on it basically
340160 i told my agent ken pavia i have nothing against kevin but personally i dont want him to fight again until he gets his hands fixed i dont want any other fighter to go through what i went through
340161 i dont think its cool that he fought with his hands like that it put himself and others that hes competing with in danger just look at me i can accept a loss but i cant accept a loss or the consequence of someone elses wrong doing in a fight like that
340162 i decided to stop and watch from the outside in order to be able to see everything that happens inside fighting
340163 i had to find myself its my aim to fight once or twice by the end of the year but the most important thing is to come back well prepared to come back different from what i was i want to be a much more dynamic fighter in the next phase of my career
340164 in america the crowds noisier more agitated and wants to be entertained for them sometimes its not important that an american wins they want to watch a great fight and we have to adapt ourselves to that i like the japanese people a lot and i would like to fight in japan again but if america is dominating the market i want to be there ive already fought against almost all of the top fighters i want very much to be part of this new market im waiting on a good contract to make my comeback im doing my part to be well prepared and ill be back to dominate the scene
340165 when i arrived at carlson gracies gym at 16 years old i already wanted to fight in mma and one of my specialties was taking my opponent down striking him and hurting him from that position this was cut from mma when i went to fight in japan in the ufc you can use the cage which is perfect for me because once you have your opponent in the corner theres no escape its excellent to use to get the takedown once on the ground its perfect for striking its fatal with those rules i guess the referee will have to stop a lot of my fights quickly because my great strong point is striking from above from any position the third factor i see is that anyone in the ring who gets tired in five minutes is in the wrong place im accustomed to fighting one 10 minute round and two five minute rounds in the ufc its three five minute rounds which is like childs play for me im flying in and out with that time i wouldnt even stop to wipe my forehead the ufc rules were made for me no doubt about it
340166 i think the promotion would have to be the ufc because it offers the best proposals and the best fighters and its the best event and the best show the best opponent for me is whoever has the belt but i dont think theres any way to come back and fight right away for the belt
340167 i passed the medical board and my license to fight was obtained without any problems but the fact is that in california the commission is very rigid for admittance one of the main conditions to let you fight is the ability to pass all of your tests on time i had to be in america by july 13 the visa was only good until the fourteenth and my tickets were purchased in advance for the fifteenth on the whole i was late they thought the organizers could agree and settle the problem but they quickly found out they would not be able to get me on the card instead they were able to find a suitable replacement for paul buentello the laws in california are so rigid
340168 yeah i believe i will be fighting but im going to let affliction do all of the announcing
340169 oh yeah its a big double standard im sure if i were the ex middleweight champion i could get away with stuff im sure if i would have done id be banned
340170 its definitely frustrating i was upset of course but im going to keep on fighting it could be a blessing in disguise with the other organizations out there
340171 its like a three year deal with the the ultimate fighter and all
340172 i think they can release you whenever they want so yeah they kind of let me go
340173 i thought the whole thing was blown out of proportion
340174 i just said what goes around comes around kind of meaning about the double standards not meaning anything bad i guess they kind of took it the wrong way but i didnt mean anything bad by it
340175 i actually really dont know if it is i think its kind of funny because i definitely didnt make those comments to piss anybody off
340176 huerta is one of a growing number of zuffa contracted fighter who feel that there is a disconnection between the companys success and the way fighters are compensated
340177 hes also unhappy with the terms of his current contract but to huerta the press tours underscore a larger point by and the large zuffa does not treat its contracted fighters with sufficient loyalty or respect he argues that many ufc fighters barely make enough to cover their training expenses he brings up teammate keith jardine repeatedly incensed that a main event fighter is working for ten and ten 10k to show and 10k to win while his opponent regularly makes ten times as much
340178 huertas expression hardens and becomes more animated as talk turns to endorsements

340223 this is where much work needs to be done and where asean can continue to carry on its role as a key player in regional affairs
340224 for a start it needs to implement many of the agreements that it has adopted including setting into motion the setting up of the economic socio cultural and security communities
340225 by walking the talk asean builds up its credibility as a serious player in regional affairs which in turn enhances its standing in the wider international community

340260 were really lucky at everton that weve got a manager who wants to get into that top four as well weve also got a history and a fan base that suggests we are a massive club that is why we joined and the club is going in the right direction

340278 we thought well theres no reason to make this into a film whatsoever so why bother reading it
340279 when i met him i thought he would say oh yes well do the musical but ill get bernie taupin
340280 i guess because i knew the characters so well because i knew the world of the story
340281 a lot of the songs came from speeches in the movie and we just then slightly altered and filled them out to become lyrics
340282 the great thing about musicals is that you can say things that you couldnt possibly say in a film or in a play because the music allows you a bigger emotional range it was fantastic to be able to fill out all those things that in a movie youre always cutting back and here you could really go to town on
340283 i was kind of dancing in my bedroom to the elton john songs of the day and had all his albums and now im at the end of the piano watching elton set music to my lyrics because it was about my childhood loving elton john and music and that being a way out for me the whole thing is very sort of strange and circular
340284 at the heart of the musical is of course elton johns music what he managed to do was to take the popular idioms of the place where i grew up and create songs using these different forms from the community
340285 it was very important to us to keep the integrity of its setting and what its about you know a broadway audience is a really sophisticated audience probably the most sophisticated in the world most of our changes are nothing to do with the cultural differences but really trying to dig deep and have a show that really works here
340286 its always changing and always growing and were always discovering new ways of doing things new ways of sort of clinching moments
340287 there are loads of opportunities to write for the specific actors and just hearing the last two weeks of rehearsal and them tackling the parts i can see opportunities to make things tailored to them thats whats great about the way we work its quite an organic process really and rehearsing with a lot of people who dont share the background you know the northeast of england and what everything means really forces you to ask questions about anything that isnt clear
340288 i love going back to shows that i care about because you get another crack at it
340289 and designing a new musical is really hard because its being written as you do it but the deadlines for the delivering of the design for the scenery never match the deadlines for the writing and obviously its a thing in flux
340290 we were anxious not to trundle scenery around a lot there are short scenes long scenes and its important to stay inside billys head and to stay with billy all of the time
340291 things just kind of move discretely around him and i think the audience doesnt notice and i think thats quite an achievement to go from one large location to another and really have the audience not be thinking about that but be thinking about the experience billys just had and the experience hes going into
340292 it was wonderful i loved london its very different from new york its a wonderful city and i loved the rehearsals
340293 i think the biggest difference between london and broadway is the actors and actresses are different people and on broadway i have to make my accent a little bit more clear so that the people in america can understand it

340404 charter can only guarantee that their digital customers will be able to see peg channels
340405 many of the comments are from elderly or retired people on fixed incomes who dont want to pay an additional 5 a month or go out and buy another tv to keep up with what the city is doing with their property taxes
340406 what were hoping is that charter will realize this is not a good move and they will simply back off
340407 we think that we would draw new viewers to the programming particularly that younger demographic accustomed to the digital world
340408 here are my subjectively chosen top 10 graphic novels but why these the very nature of a guide is premised on the idea that a here are the things that someone with a reasonable amount of experience reading and thinking about comics feels are the coolest things out there and
340409 but for my top 10 i decided to take the cr me de la cr me the graphic novels that i most enjoyed these are graphic novels some famous some less well known that do what all great literature does in that they give you such a pleasurable experience while reading that youre simultaneously eager to uncover the ending yet also dreading it knowing that the experience will then be over
340410 we are reviewing the launches of our suv brands however we would not be introducing either of the products this year
340411 we have a basket of global assets for the governance point of view it will be easier to manage the assets under a single entity

340440 a sad fact of the current state of our democracy is that anyone who wants to be president has to be by any reasonable definition completely insane the fact that they are insane doesnt necessarily prevent them from being good presidents but nonetheless they are completely bonkers
340441 comfortable with the whole social conservative aspect of the party hes a big patriot and has a big respect for the military his wife was a navy nurse but being judgmental and moralistic thats just not his cup of tea
340442 about civil unions and gay marriage where he wasnt necessarily in lockstep with the republican party
340443 the reality is that ive been dealing with it for so long that it is just a part of me
340444 dont only think of the hammer but what you can build with it
340445 hey that dress looks really pretty on you but i can see your tummy pooch
340446 sorry thats not a valid option have a nice day goodbye
340447 i still base a lot of decisions on whether or not something is going to set me off or not
340448 you know the only thing that could feel better winning another one
340449 theres always pressure coming into the season because we put that pressure on ourselves
340450 our goal every year since 1997 my first year coming here is to win a state championship
340451 weve been working hard all spring and summer with the running and lifting but its a good feeling when its finally official when the season is here and youre getting ready to put on pads
340452 the first few days were going to be strictly offense and getting offensive schemes in which takes a little longer to learn
340453 as we start getting pads on and get into live contact well put more of the defensive schemes in
340454 i think the bottom line is that the game is still supposed to be about having fun and about togetherness and teamwork all the life lessons that you get out of it
340455 we try to focus on just having fun and being the best that they can possibly be
340456 when i blow this whistle you sprint like its the fourth quarter
340457 im going to be on you like white on rice
340458 every time they start getting slacked we just say 2 9 2 9 3 8
340459 thats the last three records of havelock high school we dont want to be one of those teams that has a losing record
340460 this is a new offense new defense and new stuff on special teams
340461 i told them this wasnt going to be easy but everything were doing is proven
340462 with this offense and defense ive never had a losing record as a head coach or an assistant coach so im hoping thats going to transfer here
340463 its going to be challenging but were up for it
340464 a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
340465 i know some of the people on our team can go harder than they were going
340466 we incorporated a little bit of the spread last year and youll see a lot more out of us this year
340467 weve got a couple kids that can throw the ball and some kids that can catch and were blessed with speed and weve got a good running back in aaron northan that can run the zone for us
340468 weve got a new spread it opens it up for the run so i like that
340469 the dude from havelock that was beating me the whole year he ran the spread too last year so im expecting big things from it
340470 he will see some snaps at quarterback and elsewhere on offense
340471 hes one of those kids thats multitalented maurice runs good routes hes got great hands whichever side of the ball hes on hes a competitor
340472 there will be situations where we use the two as kind of a change of pace but we just feel like as a team were better with maurice running our defensive secondary and with caleb running our offense from the quarterback position
340473 ive been doing it a long time but the first night is still really exciting
340474 if it doesnt excite you then you need to get out it doesnt ever get old and it is always a new crop of kids and new coaches we are just hoping we can get something accomplished before our scrimmage
340475 hes camped all over the state and i dont think hes missed a workout all summer bretts a leader and the kids respect him we are looking for a lot of leadership out of him
340476 our main focus is going to be our running game
340477 we just have got to run the ball better because we were so one dimensional last year our offensive line has worked hard this summer getting stronger and quicker
340478 we have got some talent coming in that will take their spots
340479 we are going to have a lot of team speed our biggest concern is our secondary we lost two corners which is a real important position
340480 in a few years everyone will be able to talk to anyone
340481 they are going to fall right into the leadership role i dont have to make them be leaders because they like being leaders
340482 its that time of year coaches are excited players are excited
340483 weve got high expectations this year and everybody is ready to go the kids were motivated and enthusiastic and they worked hard
340484 covair is an impressive player he is a talented athlete and he knows the offense we are looking for big things from him
340485 he is real upbeat and knows this is his senior year he also realizes this is our biggest senior class
340486 those are outstanding athletes so it does hurt to lose those them
340487 they did a great job for us it is not easy to replace them but weve got some kids capable of coming up and doing just as good of a job that they did
340488 defensively we put in a few new wrinkles this year
340489 we want to attack more toward the ball this year and be a lot more aggressive we are working on a lot of pressure packages
340490 are you sure you should eat that you have a dress to fit into
340491 are you suuuuuuuuure you want to buy that dress hmmmmm well oooookay
340492 we seem to be moving drifting steadily against our will against the will of every race and every people and every class toward some hideous catastrophe everyone wishes to stop it but they do not know how
340493 you know i turn back to the ancient prophets in the new testament and the signs were telling of armageddon and i find my self wondering if were the generation that will see that come about i dont know if youve noted any of those prophecies lately but believe me they certainly describe the times were going through
340494 ill be astounded if this planet will still be going fifty years from now i dont think we will reach 2000 it would be miraculous
340495 if i cant get a computer with xp on it im going to get a mac
340496 they totally got it wrong the interface is not as user friendly as xp i dont want all the funky colours and little drawings its not meant to be pretty its meant to be useful and thats how i use it with vista you dont have that option
340497 on the several occasions that we tested vista we found that it performed poorly in comparison to xp and that it was incompatible with much of our existing hardware and software
340498 xp on the other hand is working well as the core of our pc environment and i dont see any need to replace it
340499 the future is os x not beos linux or windows
340500 the guys at arstechnica have recently done their part to help rekindle the feud between mortal kombat and street fighter
340501 hey hasnt matt forcefully argued that it is sound and appropriate to argue that a vote for mccain is a vote for a third term for bush
340502 wait ill go but i need to watch this um bloggingheads episode

340545 made clear that voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to letting unions in
340546 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
340547 im a democrat im proud of it im voting for obama and thatll never change
340548 i draw the line here dont push me beyond this
340549 we still havent gotten so sophisticated that we dont need to just wash our hands
340550 that is a toxin producing subspecies that has been certainly associated with some fairly serious outbreaks
340551 children do seem to be somewhat more susceptible to developing symptoms but in any given situation people can be infected and show no signs
340552 its gonna wash anything thats on top of the fields and the grass its going to get washed into the streams
340553 i guess then the shark realized it was going somewhere it didnt want to go and then it was just gone it lets go of his toe and takes off and carried him on the shore where he was adamant about not going back in the water
340554 im still kind of freaked out by it were going to the lake next year hopefully well get a new house no catfish will get a hold of me

340567 at hue the surprised and outnumbered u s marines evicted 10 000 viet cong and vietnamese regulars from a fortified city in less than three weeks and at a loss of only 150 dead
340568 from that point on any pretense that vietnam was a civil war was over the only hope the communists had to win had to come from direct and heavy infusions of troops and supplies from hanoi moscow and peking
340569 the most appalling defeat in the history of the vietnam war an unmitigated military disaster the wars of america p 987
340570 even newsweek hardly an objective patriotic source admitted that for the first time in history the american press was more friendly to its countrys enemies than to the united states
340571 going into the 08 election voters will be presented more squarely with the question do you want a republican government or do you want a democratic government with the parties personified in large part by their presidential candidates
340572 historically we used to see huge swings between the parties barry goldwater got 38 percent of the vote i believe in 1964 eight years later president nixon got 61 percent we dont see shifts like that anymore bill clinton got 49 percent of the vote al gore and john kerry got 48 percent of the vote
340573 i expect that some of the people the republicans turned out decided to vote for the democratic candidate not a very large number but enough to make a difference in a close race
340574 of the 28 house seats the democrats won 22 were won by 2 percent or less and of those 18 were won by less than 5 000 votes
340575 do either of these candidates offer any new ideas do either inspire the kind of competence american voters were seeking on 11 7
340576 has got one thing going for him which is that we usually ask of presidential candidates we wonder how will they handle a crisis with him you dont have to ask the question you know the answer

340589 hey do you remember that time when we left that crappy party and wound up at your place baking cookies and playing hillbilly golf
340590 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
340591 scientists have an independent obligation to respect and present the truth as they see it
340592 gores circumstantial arguments are so weak that they are pathetic it is simply incredible that they and his film are commanding public attention
340593 while many are highly skilled researchers they generally do not have special knowledge about the causes of global climate change
340594 they usually can tell us only about the effects of changes in the local environment where they conduct their studies
340595 these models have been consistently wrong in all their scenarios
340596 there is no meaningful correlation between co2 levels and earths temperature over this geologic time frame in fact when co2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now about 450 million years ago the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years
340597 on the basis of this evidence how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in co2 levels would be the major cause of the past centurys modest warming
340598 the breaking glacier wall is a normally occurring phenomenon which is due to the normal advance of a glacier
340599 in antarctica the temperature is low enough to prohibit melting of the ice front so if the ice is grounded it has to break off in beautiful ice cascades if the water is deep enough icebergs will form
340600 some small areas in the antarctic peninsula have broken up recently just like it has done back in time the temperature in this part of antarctica has increased recently probably because of a small change in the position of the low pressure systems
340601 their mass balance is considered to possibly increase the sea level by 0 03 mm year not much of an effect
340602 starting in 1970 there was a precipitous drop off in the amount and extent and thickness of the arctic ice cap
340603 the survey that gore cites was a single transect across one part of the arctic basin in the month of october during the 1960s when we were in the middle of the cooling period the 1990 runs were done in the warmer month of september using a wholly different technology
340604 for several published records it is a decrease for the last 50 years
340605 there has been some decrease in ice thickness in the canadian arctic over the past 30 years but no melt down the canadian ice service records show that from 1971 1981 there was average to above average ice thickness from 1981 1982 there was a sharp decrease of 15 but there was a quick recovery to average to slightly above average values from 1983 1995 a sharp drop of 30 occurred again 1996 1998 and since then there has been a steady increase to reach near normal conditions since 2001
340606 had the ipcc used the standard parameter for climate change the 30 year average and used an equal area projection instead of the mercator which doubled the area of warming in alaska siberia and the antarctic ocean warming and cooling would have been almost in balance
340607 it is not unusual for some locations out of the thousands of cities and towns in the u s to set all time records
340608 the actual data shows that overall recent temperatures in the u s were not unusual
340609 the man is an embarrassment to us science and its many fine practitioners a lot of whom know but feel unable to state publicly that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science
340610 when he played music it was like he was having an intimate conversation with a stranger
340611 it felt like had known this stranger his entire life
340612 they should be held in custody until trial i also want to see mandatory 15 year sentences for anyone caught in possession of illegal firearms

340619 if you do the math there are a large number of people that need help
340620 its a lot more normal to have your own apartment theres a lot more opportunity to recover
340621 you have to provide that support to develop those skills it will help them grow and develop
340622 the housing project is going to accommodate people who normally would be falling through the cracks
340623 there is going to be staff on site eight hours a day seven days a week the goal is fourteen hours a day seven days a week
340624 there is still an important need for housing because for most people they cant afford the rent in our case the priority is people who need help
340625 its a support network we talk to each other and work together to achieve a common goal of recovery
340626 the interesting thing about this building is that we do things together its kind of like its own community centre in a way
340627 they have to have a mental illness they have to be followed by a psychiatrist and they must be semi autonomous
340628 once theyre in theyre guaranteed a room for the rest of their life
340629 im for obama so to hear that hes changed his mind on that it kind of upsets me a little bit
340630 i think i dont know what barack obama believes about anything
340631 the democratic leadership on the hill is well aware that theres a presidential race going on and they dont want to put their nominee in a pinch
340632 the democrats are going to say this is pragmatism this is responding to what the public wants and the republicans are going to say see he doesnt stand for anything hes flip flopping
340633 hes flipped on a lot of things hes a very good politician
340634 you want leaders that can sit across the table and get something done
340635 even if the oil prices have gone down a little bit its not enough
340636 reasonable people can find a solution we need to drill for our own oil we need to build our own power plants
340637 i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

340647 any attempt is a victory not trying is the real sin
340648 courage is the strength or choice to begin change determination is the persistence to continue in that change
340649 a strong man does not need to know his future for he makes his own
340650 its certainly the tightest i have ever known things and i have been with the company since 1991
340651 beer sales are under the most pressure we really need to be getting people into pubs
340652 but we have been in business a long time and we are hopeful things will improve its just a case of tightening our belts and taking a deep breath
340653 theres a credit squeeze and people are buying more and more beer from supermarkets and drinking at home
340654 we are having a good year in terms of sales but our profitability is down
340655 we are hoping for a good barley harvest and a good hop harvest this year because if we dont get one we are in big trouble
340656 the most difficult part of the project was the up front work of putting the applications together and securing the funding
340657 trying to preserve the building while trying to meet the current code requirements
340658 the easiest thing about this project was the cooperation of the community
340659 the building would otherwise have become a blight in a historic neighborhood
340660 it is a great way to save laurinburgs old school
340661 i never attempted having sexual relations with that man officer tush not a single time
340662 look me in the eye and tell me that im satisfied im so im so unsatisfied
340663 everybody at your party they dont look depressed and everybodys dressin funny color me impressed
340664 but mostly it shows how hard it is to be an aging rocker his finest artistic moments were so so young i still think paul is cool but i feel bad for him
340665 while there may be a small adoption fee most cats at shelters are already vaccinated and spayed or neutered
340666 additionally the cost of litter nutritious food and an occasional toy is relatively low and cats are comparatively inexpensive
340667 we are committed to saving lives and educating the public on responsible cat care
340668 our main goal is to find loving homes for animals that need one
340669 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
340670 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
340671 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
340672 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
340673 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
340674 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
340675 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
340676 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
340677 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
340678 they were showing videos all the time of suicide attacks
340679 they didnt have much effect on me because i had already decided to kill myself
340680 afghanistan is still a very tribal society and still resistant to these ideas but that is changing
340681 that makes them more susceptible to new ideology like al qaedas
340682 there are people inside pakistan who for whatever reason do not want a stable and prosperous afghanistan
340683 if you look at the typical afghan bomber involved in these operations he is poor he is uneducated and he does not know what he is getting into
340684 i can only say that i made a bad mistake
340685 i was reading about the killing the fighting the tsunamis in the newspapers
340686 i was disappointed with everything in my life there was nothing
340687 they said you will just drive into the middle of the convoy the target will be easy
340688 el camino m s dif cil es el camino al interior
340689 apunta hacia la luna pues aunque te equivoques ir s a parar a las estrellas
340690 its good to know that were finally starting to make a name for ourselves we know not to let it go to our head but its nice to know that people are expecting a lot out of the deacs and were going to work as hard as we can to give it to them
340691 its my first time hearing about it but i guess the program has grown
340692 were working hard and i guess it shows that hard work pays off
340693 it makes me feel good that other coaches respect our program and think that we can be a pretty good football team
340694 i mean thats very rewarding for me personally to know that our other coaches feel that way
340695 but for our team its a little scary its kind of lofty stuff and you really can spend too much time patting yourself on the back when you havent done anything potential means you havent done it
340696 its not a bad thing we dont want to shy away from it
340697 but i think weve got enough good juniors and seniors on our football team that if you talk to our older guys they feel good about where we are as a team right now
340698 youve got to keep kids eligible youve got to keep them out of trouble youve got to keep them healthy there are so many things that go into having a good season and then youve got to be careful that you dont spend too much time reading your press clippings because that doesnt win a football game for you
340699 he said you remember what coach hood said and im going to say the same thing
340700 he said if you look at the schedule and if you think theres a team we cant beat youre a coward and we dont need you he said if you look at the schedule and think theres a team that cant beat us youre stupid and we dont need you
340701 and its so true its that balance between knowing you can win but knowing you can lose just as easily i think everybody has done a good job of pushing each other i love where our mind is right now
340702 looking back at our 2006 season we were picked dead last in the acc atlantic division
340703 its good for our confidence we feel like people know we can make some things happen as a school and win a lot of games but until you start hitting on the field all those preseason rankings really dont mean anything
340704 im anxious to feel that first hit and see what my shoulder feels like but i definitely think im 100 percent
340705 the last couple of weeks ive been trying to get in shape as much as possible because im going to be throwing a whole bunch over the next two or three weeks
340706 its to the point where we dont even talk about it
340707 hes been throwing for the better part of two months he goes out and takes every snap and does everything hes been pushing the envelope for quite a while
340708 nothing felt like it was before i was a little worried because it didnt feel right it was just a long slow process i had to be patient with
340709 he has the opportunity to build on 12 games of experience
340710 i get a sense from him that theres a lot more personal self confidence that hes been in games and knows what he can do
340711 one of the things i like about him as i do about a lot of guys on our football team is his bodys changed
340712 he looks differently as a person hes bigger and stronger
340713 hes starting to mature hes starting to develop i think certainly thats going to be good for us
340714 junior colleges in the california system are on a different semester schedule
340715 theyre on a trimester and his classes have not yet ended we expect him to be here sometime in the next couple of weeks and certainly before the start of school
340716 ill say this with 100 percent confidence i think hes going to have his best year ever
340717 hes better than ive ever seen him barring anything unknown theres no reason he wont go out and set records he looks really really good
340718 i know he really enjoys being on the defensive right side
340719 i think its a bit of a new challenge for him hes been training all off season ive talked to him as much as hell talk and he said he just feels stronger faster bigger than ever
340720 looking back its not a secret it was a disappointing year not only stats wise but even to my personal standards
340721 i did some self evaluating and i think i made the necessary adjustments as far as conditioning and getting ready to come back this year
340722 i feel a little stronger a little more powerful and fast and quicker because ive really focused on being better in all areas not in one particular thing i just want to be better everywhere overall i put a lot of time and effort into getting in shape and being ready to come to camp
340723 the left handed stance is my natural stance the left hand is my strong hand so i have a lot more moves and power available to that side
340724 what we have discussed we both came to the agreement we were going to keep that private
340725 what ive learned over these last six years that ive been here is that year to year its unpredictable what happens with players and contracts
340726 right now im worried about playing football im not looking forward to 2009 or after that
340727 ive got to get focused on making it happen right now i have a contract to play football right now
340728 after this season thats a different story but my focus as a football player i can only control what i can control
340729 the act of borrowing money at 0 typically on a credit card earning interest on the money and paying it back before the 0 period ends
340730 borrowing at 0 to lend out at a higher rate
340731 i dont want to take a cab i want to walk
340732 are you telling me to take a cab because im going to get jumped or cause its far
340733 oh yeah i just walked from xavier down past the superdome and then over here what you got
340734 fine you want to walk heres what you do come on
340735 the bywater is the last place for true bohemia in new orleans to live im moving my store over there by the 15th on the other side of my house cant take the rents over here anymore what are you doing here
340736 you know i had some kids architecture students from pennsylvania who moved into the other side of my house maybe a year and a half after the hurricane to try out some of their building concepts things like that
340737 yeah they fell in love with it down here and eventually decided to stay they set up shop pretty cool huh
340738 because i only do it one way and thats one box at a time
340739 i dont want a p o box where are yall
340740 i know who ya are im here painting houses but i am an artist and i am looking for yall no where are yall
340741 my mother had been beautiful she still is in fact my mother is still everything she has been just a bit forgetful i try to convince myself thats all that it is and if she really concentrated she would not repeat herself so much there isnt anything wrong with her
340742 the extraordinary turn of events followed the governments payment in june of a settlement valued at 5 82 million to a former government scientist steven j hatfill who was long targeted as the fbis chief suspect despite a lack of any evidence that he had ever possessed anthrax
340743 llegamos muertos y nos fue mal aunque curiosamente en una escala del viaje a australia inauguramos en jap n el pabell n en el que fuimos campeones del mundo
340744 me divert a mucho verlo jugar en el bar a aunque tal vez me asemejo m s a andr s jim nez por caracter sticas de juego y por amistad personal soy muy de llorente
340745 est claro que esa selecci n fue un referente para todos hizo algo hist rico y ponernos a su altura va a ser complicado seguro epi y el resto son los espejos en los que nos hemos mirado todos pone los pelos de punta la comparaci n
340746 era m s alto y tal vez la comparaci n no sea perfecta pero claro que siempre te fijas en ellos la gente le quer a mucho
340747 sabemos la dificultad que implica hoy en d a disputar unos juegos que alcancemos estas cifras es la representaci n del buen momento que atraviesa el baloncesto espa ol nos gustar a alg n tipo de reconocimiento en forma de medalla porque ser a un bonito colof n

340756 a and jar ya le seguimos en almer a es un gran portero
340757 siempre le hemos tenido en cuenta pero hay que aunar los intereses econ micos con los deportivos
340758 el fichaje de moy es un tema que est paralizado ahora mismo hay otras opciones
340759 porque entonces no importar si caigo en la primera ronda de los juegos y roger los gana s que estoy en una buena posici n y no s lo porque federer tenga que ganar todo a partir de aqu los juegos ol mpicos y el us open
340760 estoy muy satisfecho por la victoria frente a un gran rival como el mil n pero no hay que lanzar las campanas al vuelo sab amos que ten amos que evitar el toque de ellos en el centro del campo hemos sido superiores en la posesi n de bal n aunque hay que seguir creciendo en ese aspecto el equipo necesita todav a ritmo y una posici n m s larga pero me quedo con las llegadas la actitud de todos y la inquietud de los nuevos de memorizar los movimientos para que el equipo sea m s fuerte
340761 trat ndose de la selecci n brasile a se espera algo m s todav a falta velocidad
340762 se ha notado el desgaste natural del equipo debido al fuerte calor lo que es importante porque ser exactamente lo que pase en china
340763 se han corregido las carencias que ten a la plantilla
340764 hemos corregido ciertas carencias que se hab an detectado en la plantilla

340772 you have language barriers you have immigration problems you have the church who by the way i dont see anywhere in this fight you have that social stigma among the many latinos who are married but still gay no one wants to talk about the problem
340773 these younger guys run a really high risk of infection
340774 we dont want them to get caught up in all that and become a statistic
340775 sometimes its as simple as teaching people about how to use a condom
340776 what we do is put it in their head that they need to start having safe sex
340777 for a lot of black people its a down low movement you know a lot of brothers dont want to talk about it they dont want anything coming back to them
340778 and a lot of brothers are just afraid to get tested too

340804 the secret of their success interviews with legends and luminaraies
340805 government intervention creates unintended consequences that lead to calls for further intervention and so on into a destructive spiral of more and more government control
340806 government is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
340807 it was too sad and happy that it made me cry if we didnt leave i would still be crying
340808 i wanted to cry louder but i thought all the people would hear me
340809 and all rich white people in america do not care for socialist values because they do not have to think about all the trials so many less fortunate americans face

340814 this is one of the toughest states not only two but a group of seven of our students while they were going out for outreach they were rounded up by 30 or 40 people who simply destroyed their literature burned their bibles and beat them up without mercy
340815 for 30 a month anyone can help to train one of these young people we have 7 000 young people now in our bible colleges all across the asian nations and we have the possibility to recruit thousands more if we had people pray and help them

340818 we held a discipleship seminar with students from the main university there in juba we came together for a weeks seminar and really just some foundations of the faith applying some of those foundations for those particular situations that they face there
340819 its a battle theres a lot of people suffering its hard to articulate what theyre going through because we havent experienced it personally but in the middle of it i do believe that the love of christ is being shown being demonstrated through our brothers and sisters there pray for their strength pray for encouragement pray for hope
340820 they were confronted by nine muslims who were yelling anti christian slogans and hurling stones at the christians
340821 unless the growth of radical islam is curbed in ethiopia the attacks against christians will continue to rise ethiopian government officials should be made accountable for failing to protect christians against such attacks
340822 we have a whole generation of kids coming up that has not been exposed to the hiv prevention information done on community wide bases or through clinics and so on and yet these are the very children orphaned by parents or other relatives because of aids
340823 because we are a christian based organization the curriculum that has been designed by teachers in africa for the african classroom are very biblically based to give them a moral basis to make wise decisions
340824 i noticed your way of doing things is very meek and very quiet
340825 that doesnt work here you have to get that authoritative voice when that nice voice isnt working dont be afraid of them dont be their friend you are in charge of that classroom

340827 the immediate story is we could not get enough families to reenroll next year because of the economy and pressures on folks to pay for food and gas and things like that
340828 before we didnt see children engaging in questioning deep thinking problem solving orally now our children are being critical thinkers aloud they are asking questions were teaching our children how to pick apart the msa through their daily experiences its not being taught to the test but how to think
340829 traditionally a lot more of our teachers were pulling out our students and working with separate curriculums and focusing on important language aspects that were not necessarily connected with the curriculum taught in the class
340830 now theres a lot more connection between esol teachers and classroom teachers
340831 i think we feel confident were on the right track but were not cocky we have a lot of work ahead of us

340843 the mayor doesnt believe that libraries should be forced to reduce hours and the administration is committed to finding the money to resolve budget issues
340844 i dont think its necessary and i do believe the library system has in its budget adequate funds to keep the libraries open
340845 the library at this time is well funded to withstand a little belt cinching
340846 the number one request was to keep libraries open as much as possible
340847 it hardly seems possible that mcps could have slipped that badly when the whole focus of the enterprise is to look good on the msa

340929 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can

340941 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
340942 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas

340972 however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
340973 we look forward to working with government to discuss the transitional rebate arrangements until the gross feed in tariff policy is in place

340981 its not from enjoying myself i wasnt in krystle nightclub
340982 im not sure yet if shell be jumping in the aga khan shes been very successful she jumped clear on the irish team in rome
340983 its a labour of love in the past few weeks i woke up each morning and thought jesus i love what i do a lot of work goes in for what you get out of it so youd have to love horses how many people are working in a job busting their ass and dont really like what theyre doing i dont know how you do that there are disappointments horses knocking poles not being picked for teams just things can go bad there are a lot of ups and downs in the game
340984 you dont just wake up and say im going to do this or that i think thats whats wrong with some guys now its good to be ambitious but you should keep your head down and work as hard as you can
340985 you can have your own little plans quietly to yourself some of the guys come here and theyre like prima donnas theyve got their ralph lauren and gucci shoes and they jump a few mickey mouse 1m30 classes and theyre telling me theyre going to be on this or that team yet they havent a hope the only way you start is by grafting away and the opportunities will come
340986 im young enough and ill have a chance to go to future games
340987 theres no point in saying any different to that but if anyone chooses to go into google and look up the results of the hearing the fei said cleared of any wrongdoing didnt affect the performance of the horse that it was a residue from a veterinary treatment and had no effect but the rules are zero and we were outside the rules so we just had to accept that
340988 it was very difficult a rollercoaster ride but im very lucky im not just saying that there are a lot of good people around clients in the yard my sponsors the staff so much support which is really fantastic i could show you boxes of letters from people i didnt even know i got a bit of stick from those within the sport its funny how things happen now there are many more owners and people wanting to get involved with me than before that which maybe shows theres no such thing as bad press
340989 i kept going to shows yeah there were a few people causing trouble and trying to kick you when youre down but im only 28 and theyre a bit older than me so its a long road
340990 never i was always adamant that i wanted to see it through to the end as the truth will always come out in the wash it never even crossed my mind to quit because i love what im doing my conscience is clear its something i really want to be good and successful at so why let a few people put you off what you want to do
340991 when you go through something like that you have to be careful not to end up nasty thats a big thing im not going to wake up an angry little man every morning i try to look at it with an old head ive jumped in more than 65 nations cups and this is my seventh consecutive year on the squad for the aga khan you can talk in the bar or you can talk in the ring i think talking in the ring is the best
340992 yeah you learn from experience i suppose im a stronger person i try to think long term and to be a good person too life is short
340993 i think you should work as hard as you can when youre young but i dont need to murder myself either i try to enjoy life too so i dont want to be doing the shows for a very long time its a tough life you travel a lot and live out of a suitcase its very difficult to have a stable relationship or family in that life
340994 im the worst person you could ask that question to because im 28 and ive no girlfriend
340995 it depends on the individual in a relationship with someone youre going to be away from for a long time they have to be a best friend too certainly someone you respect and get along with ive had interesting times
340996 over the next number of years i want to concentrate on my career i do have a long term plan but its like finding a good horse you cant just say youre going to find it in the morning
340997 thats going to read bad you know what i mean if you try too hard its not going to work
340998 id find that hard i dont know why i just couldnt be bothered
340999 i havent found the rule book on relationships but the more i put pressure on to look for something the less it happens so youve got to sit back and let it happen

341090 theyve been kind of hurting me and thats who i need to get out thats the main thing just try to work on pitching to those guys
341091 i thought he pitched a whole lot better last season
341092 i think hes capable of pitching better than he has this year right now its a matter of him going down in a less pressure environment and getting some success getting his confidence back i told him to get some success under his belt and get back up here
341093 what kranitz and i said to him was that i hope he understands he said he fully does
341094 i hate to see the guy keep failing its a whole different ballgame in the big leagues especially in our division he just needs to go get some success because it wasnt coming im confident that hell get back on track go down there with a purpose
341095 i never felt when i was out there like i wasnt going to get outs
341096 it just hasnt been happening mentally im fine confidence wise i dont think that ive been beaten up ill just go down there work on some stuff make better pitches
341097 he gives us some depth in the infield probably more an offensive type player well welcome him back on the club i dont know exactly what his role will be as far as will he start will he backup he gives me some options im going to play castro tonight but cintron will get an opportunity to play
341098 im excited just the last two days i felt like i was getting called up again
341099 hopefully i can help the team in any role they want me to be if they need me to come off the bench like i did before ill be more than happy

341122 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours

341153 changing the way we think about public infrastructure we have is going to take a long time
341154 im always hopeful that smart well intentioned people will find ways to come together to solve public problems im never surprised when they dont
341155 we really know now that the bridges we have wont stand up forever without investing a lot in keeping them up and keeping the highway infrastructure going we know that now we didnt probably think about that a year ago
341156 if we can change the habits of the politicians and agency staff to ask questions about whats been kept up whats current status rather than focusing on ribbon cuttings that will be a sea change

341158 our concern is that there actually is a significant amount of specific suicide information peppered throughout the book
341159 included in the book is information identifying and repeatedly identifying what nitschke terms the best drug with which to suicide
341160 the reason we did that was not to have an annual ball but having said that when we actually had the ball we realized people were very taken by the idea of having a veterans ball
341161 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it
341162 a lot of people enjoyed it and the board decided to make it an annual event
341163 were hoping to make the event a bit bigger this year
341164 they all benefit from what the foundation can give to us
341165 although roughly 6 million u s citizens are eligible to vote oversees using absentee ballots many of whom are serving in the military only a fraction of their ballots are being counted
341166 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
341167 by next year at this time we may be saying rush who
341168 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible
341169 his favorite technique for discrediting an idea with which he disagrees is to make petty personal attacks against the people who espouse that idea
341170 he is not a nice man and he doesnt pretend to be and hes nasty
341171 limbaugh reminds us of morton downey jr the celebrated tv hatemonger of a few years ago

341183 the second point is mitchells history he has long been an advocate for what can be called at best fringe science starting with his tests of psychic powers on that same lunar flight thats fine in fact i support things like that if done rigorously but clearly in my opinion he goes way too far government coverups of actual aliens really wheres the proof of that the evidence is always circumstantial and that makes me suspicious indeed we have governments that cannot coverup a simple break in a tryst in the white house or trade deals between iran and the contras those are cakewalks compared to the massive conspiracy theorized by the ufo crowd no my point is that i dont really see why this is suddenly news hes been talking fringe science for decades so i want to be very clear here i have enormous deep and profound respect for all the men who walked on the moon and all the men and women who put them there but that does not give them a pass to ignore evidence and to draw drastically unrealistic conclusions without evidence to support them
341184 weve updated the user interface to improve usability and add a few often requested features such as selectable detail levels and alphabetical sorting of bookmarks

341200 but when we have people on base im going to make people run and see more life i think thats the key the keys not to have 30 rabbits if the rabbits are not on base the key is when those guys are on base make sure you bring them in thats the key about baseball
341201 right now with the team in a pennant race i just have to be solid and cant dwell on at bats because its not about my personal numbers

341205 the militant republic ready to launch aggressive war in the name of
341206 it has been recognized at all times that this manner of interrogating human beings of putting them under torture produces nothing good
341207 viewed from iraq at the tail end of a 15 month deployment the political debate in washington is indeed surreal w e are skeptical of recent press coverage portraying the conflict as increasingly manageable and feel it has neglected the mounting civil political and social unrest we see every day
341208 in the end we need to recognize that our presence may have released iraqis from the grip of a tyrant but that it has also robbed them of their self respect they will soon realize that the best way to regain dignity is to call us what we are an army of occupation and force our withdrawal
341209 soldiers you are about to undertake a conquest the effects of which on civilization and commerce are incalculable
341210 we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime with new tactics and precision weapons we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians

341213 were helping to rebuild iraq where the dictator built palaces for himself instead of hospitals and schools and we will stand with the new leaders of iraq
341214 as they establish a government of by and for the iraqi people
341215 the revolutionary regime is the despotism of liberty against tyranny
341216 in a republic only republicans are citizens royalists and foreigners are enemies
341217 our nation is more secure because of you the tyrant has fallen and iraq is free
341218 the people of egypt were most wretched how will they not cherish the liberty we are bringing them
341219 men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air everywhere that freedom arrives humanity rejoices and everywhere that freedom stirs let tyrants fear
341220 we liberated that country from a tyrant i think the iraqi people owe the american people a huge debt of gratitude thats the problem here in america they wonder whether or not there is a gratitude level thats significant enough in iraq
341221 their dwellings are adobe huts which prosperity the daughter of liberty will now allow them to abandon
341222 where freedom takes hold hatred gives way to hope when freedom takes hold men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life
341223 finished burning the rest of the houses or rather the huts so as to provide a terrible object lesson to these half savage and barbarous people

341237 i find it very disappointing that any organisation would breach protocol on something as exciting as an opening ceremony where its supposed to be one of the big surprises of the games outside of athletic performance
341238 its also the spirit of it they know very well it should be kept private
341239 at the beginning of the rehearsal they made a broadcast saying that nobody is supposed to take any pictures
341240 of course i dont think its authorised we are still looking into the details of the situation

341263 shit it turns out carl is awesome what do we do now

341344 thats the death we need to die as a sinner
341345 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
341346 but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
341347 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
341348 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way

341369 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end
341370 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
341371 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
341372 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that terrorist groups are not eradicated overnight
341373 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies

341377 algunas de las cosas que en el libro estaban escritas en futuro
341378 los reaccionarios en su desesperado y ciego af n de combatirnos han tergiversado todo y se han esforzado por hacer ver que el socialismo acaba con todas las formas de la propiedad privada y establece la propiedad colectiva sobre todas las cosas grandes y peque as importantes y no importantes eso es una falsedad
341379 el socialismo no significa la abolici n de todas las formas de la propiedad privada
341380 el socialismo respeta la propiedad de los artesanos de los peque os propietarios y peque os comerciantes a los que se lleva al socialismo a trav s de cooperativas u otras formas que permitan la incorporaci n de su propiedad individual peque a atrasada y poco productiva a la propiedad colectiva avanzada sin explotaci n del trabajo ajeno
341381 el establecimiento de la propiedad colectiva sobre los medios fundamentales de producci n no quiere decir que haya de ejercerse necesariamente violencia sobre todos los propietarios

341388 students are discouraged from carrying cellular phones they may not be visible and any misuse or disruption of the classroom routine will result in disciplinary action and possible confiscation from the item students should not have cellular phones in the classroom the school accepts no responsability for the loss or the damage of these items students are allowed to use cellular phones during nutrition and lunch and before and after school
341389 i believe the cellphone rule is not a good one because we need them for emergencies
341390 we have the new cellphone rule to keep the cellphones in the lockers because we dont need them in class they are disruptive and the negatives far weight the positives when the students have their cellphones confiscated the first time it is given back to the student the second time a parent has to come get the phone in ordered for it to be returned and the third time the student will go under school probation because he or she has demonstrated that they are not able to follow the rules

341407 i read the first page of soma and never put it down until i read the last page then my housemate took it from me and read it in a day it flows through your hands like water yet it shocks awes repulses exposes trade secrets and illuminates the deep motives for extreme behavior i know people who are less real than these characters i laughed out loud kemble scott is one sick bastard
341408 no you need to go hear about pitchcraft trust me
341409 is not actual reality but was my reality my way of surviving
341410 its very upsetting to us because we spent so much time with this person and we felt such sympathy for her and she would talk about how she didnt have any money or any heat and we completely bought into that and thought we were doing something good by bringing her story to light
341411 theres a huge personal betrayal here as well as a professional one
341412 dont think it strange my lords to hear orlando innamorato sung it always is the proudest man whom love defeats and subjugates no strong arm no audacity no blade well honed no shield or mail no other power can avail for in the end love conquers all
341413 its strong and its sudden and its cruel sometimes but it might just save your life thats the power of love

341415 i threw a lot of off speed stuff but theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what youve got to do to win
341416 he changed speeds well then started throwing more fastballs to keep them off balance he kept them off balance pretty much all day
341417 we knew coming in that he knows how to pitch a little bit and has some weapons to pitch
341418 im pretty sure there is pressure on me but i try not to think about it
341419 my job is just to go out there and give us a chance to win

341426 the weather is going to get nice and hot youll see well try to exclude someone from the lineup on an everyday basis
341427 there are a lot of day games in chicago a lot of guys dont want to come out of the lineup including myself but everybody needs a day off
341428 were the only team that plays so many day games and its hot if you go out there and try to take bp at 10 or 10 30 in the morning youre going to waste yourself
341429 hes going to go out and pitch 3 innings somewhere the next few days
341430 some sudden and unexpected event taking place without expectation upon the instant rather than something that continues progresses or develops the word may be used to connote a calamity casualty catastrophe and disaster an undesirable or unfortunate happening
341431 i cant say we didnt make mistakes that i knew what i was doing
341432 sometimes i called a meeting and nobody showed up sometimes preachers said why should i listen to you sometimes we tried to hold politicians accountable and they didnt show up i couldnt tell whether i got more out of it than this neighborhood
341433 i grew up to be a man right here in this area its as a consequence of working with this organization and this community that i found my calling there was something more than making money and getting a fancy degree the measure of my life would be public service
341434 be open with the issues include the community instead of going behind the communitys back and he would include people we didnt like sometimes youve got to bring people together if you exclude people youre only weakening yourself if you meet behind doors and make decisions for them theyll never take ownership of the issue
341435 the way capital cases were tried in illinois at the time was so rife with error questionable police tactics racial bias and shoddy lawyering that thirteen death row inmates had been exonerated and a republican governor had decided to institute a moratorium on all executions
341436 w e convened sometimes daily meeting between prosecutors public defenders police organizations and death penalty opponents keeping our negotiations as much as possible out of the press instead of focusing on the serious disagreements around the table i talked about the common value that i believed everyone shared regardless of how each of us might feel about the death penatly that is the basic principle that no innocent person should end up on death row and that no person guilty of a capital offense should go free when police representatives presented concrete problems with the bills design that would have impeded their investigations we modified the bill when police representatives offered to videotape only the confessions we held firm pointing out that the whole purpose of the bill was to give the public cofidence that confessions were obtained free of coercion at the end of the process the bill had the support of all the parties involved it passed unanimously in the illinois senate and was signed into law
341437 everything i see reflects that community organizing experience i see the consensus building his connection to people and listening to their needs and trying to find common ground i think at his heart barack is a community organizer i think what hes doing now is that its just a larger community to be organized

341449 it is important to point out that this is not only a book about the loss of place but also about the suffering of people this is a collection of writing that remembers the children who do not have good water to bathe in the people who travel unsafe roads or live beneath sites that have already sent boulders crashing through their homes
341450 in fifty years youll have use for this land you cant use steep hillsides
341451 such a view typifies the bizaro alice in wonderland through the looking glass logic that come into play in such discussions asserting that appalachian tourism cannot revolve around the natural beauty of a prehistoric mountain range but that it will thrive around things like golf course on leveled plains is the opposite of logic

341460 a sophisticated and creative blog that pokes rambunctious irreverent and most of all sexy fun at the game of poker and everyone who is connected with it
341461 youve made me so angry i wish i could reach into my screen and just pound your scummy worthless head in
341462 if you ask me you should just go straight to wicked chops poker instead these guys are awesome
341463 wicked chops is wickedly funny and wickedly irreverent and posts a lot of photos of wickedly attractive women if that aint poker what is
341464 these girls think its a cute game but its inappropriate and its unnecessary
341465 i couldnt possibly know if its real or not but i know that its probably not necessary for most children to have a cell phone
341466 its part of this whole rush to adulthood hello kitty backpacks for third graders have cell phone pockets in them marketers have skillfully created a groundswell of begging among kids and we all know that begging can work
341467 bringing up geeks how to protect your kids childhood in a grow up too fast world
341468 shes been saying shes the only one at school without a phone and its actually getting to be true
341469 if youve got good reasons for them to have it id go ahead
341470 how do you deal with the unknown we just dont have the data
341471 girls tend to get them younger its become a status symbol it makes them feel grown up
341472 so many scary studies come out this will give some parents second thoughts and other parents ammunition but for the vast majority its not going to mean a lot
341473 due to contracts that are allegedly fubar and associated wrangling the navajo nation is
341474 is there a place for an inexpensive ham technogeek foss solution that could bypass the antics of the for pay providers
341475 i wonder what life would be like if we let jesus live through you and me
341476 somebody told me that there were redheaded woodpeckers up here so i came walked five minutes and there was a redheaded woodpecker
341477 and it flew into a hole in a tree and i said wow this is easy
341478 the young make a lot of chattering so you can usually tell where the nest is
341479 theres a redheaded and hes got a baby with him
341480 see these two trees to the left go to the right most one it forks and theres a broken off snag up there looks like a y thats where the babies were sticking their head out a couple weeks ago it was really cute
341481 were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
341482 if our theory see this is all theory if our theory is correct the golf course replicates an oak savannah and there should be birds there
341483 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters
341484 they cant drill the hole but they live there so what were trying to do is preserve the habitat so the woodpeckers drill the hole and when they leave something else will come in and live in it
341485 its made a dream that commissioner sam jones had several years ago
341486 he had envisioned that site being utilized to help bring a sewer to the north end of the county
341487 the reason we are still trying to replace our aging refueling tankers is because boeing executives were involved in a scandal of bribery and cheating in the last bid
341488 theyre just outrageous smear tactics at its very worst hitting below the belt
341489 she was very quiet she was secluded she would talk but not much
341490 just by the experssion on her face it seemed like she just had a sad face and ive never seen her with a sad face so i asked if everything was okay and she said that it was okay i said well you know you can talk to me when you get ready and she said i will she looked back at me when she was leaving and she just started waving her hand bye i never seen her since
341491 it was about 2 30 maybe 4 in the morning when we got that call
341492 i just want him and his family to know that he really hurt my family real bad what he took away from us we wont never have back again i hope he understands that
341493 basically if its not wind or solar power jeanne shaheens against it
341494 this ad is false and misleading and we demand that you refuse to continue to air this advertisement
341495 states that governor shaheen is against all drilling when in fact she supports new oil drilling including offshore oil drilling
341496 because you are not legally required to air this advertisement your station bears responsibility for its content when you do grant access
341497 the media company we used for this ad had received from all the station managers copies of the letter and were asking us to provide background on the ad so they could go back to the shaheen attorneys and say that they have information that suggests otherwise
341498 we hope you will reject the attempt to stifle political debate and instead permit the voters of new hampshire to continue to receive truthful information to our country
341499 this is the fourth attempt to distract new hampshire citizens from the fact that john sununu has been walking in lock step with the bush economic agenda that has driven up the cost of gasoline
341500 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
341501 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
341502 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
341503 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
341504 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
341505 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
341506 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
341507 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
341508 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
341509 incarcerating my son is not going to benefit the state of new hampshire chris is not a danger
341510 he took a sledgehammer to another human beings head three times
341511 hillsborough county department of corrections your tax dollars at work
341512 were going to give them some time more than we would normally provide a community with because the task is so great
341513 i spent time on wellington road and then at mcgregor street and i think both times i was there motorists stopped by to compliment them on their work
341514 they said wow weve looked at this for 15 years it looks so much better now to see the weeds gone
341515 this might be the most intriguing matchup of the first round
341516 theyve got guys that make plays they have skills and they make plays for their quarterback
341517 thats a quality group and they have a quarterback playing well
341518 hes got some playoff experience too from last year with spokane
341519 the pressure is going to be on the front line to get him uncomfortable
341520 i was a little surprised to hear about it but were really not worried at all
341521 weve got the best surveillance system around plus everyone knows the cops gas up here all the time weve got a really great police crew theyve already been up here twice today as a matter of fact
341522 my bill will provide new tools to stop any effort to use the claw back statute against goss in a case where the japanese government has tried to unfairly and inappropriately protect a japanese company found guilty of fraudulent practices
341523 tks has been found guilty in our courts and ordered to pay over 30 million in damages and the japanese government should not be allowed to nullify this judgment through retaliatory acts that are solely intended to subvert our rule of law
341524 the pre penalty notice has been drafted and is under legal review
341525 cbp takes all allegations of fraud and misconduct very seriously however the penalty process set forth in 19 u s c 1592 which congress established to ensure due process and fair play to all is still ongoing we will make every effort to finalize that process as soon as possible
341526 if its good for the bottom line we are finding it is also good for the environment
341527 the landscape is changing it is easier for us to recycle and new markets are opening up so we are doing a lot of research
341528 its a win win and now it is extending to the mount washington hotel
341529 i ran to get her and before i could get her she was down
341530 its a mixed bag its a nice accomplishment but you also have to be around for a while
341531 i cant make the decisions on who gets moved up or whatever all i can do is my part and those records tell me im doing that

341533 manny and me we were good friends of course im going to miss him but this is a business and we take care of what we have to do
341534 hopefully everything starts going good and everybody will move on and play the game the way were supposed to weve got to fight through it
341535 after reviewing the facts and circumstances surrounding any type of firearm discharge the security manager may order that the court security officer involved receive a psychological examination
341536 were not commenting on this at all or the particulars of the case because it is still under investigation
341537 what we know is that he was wearing an ankle holster and that the firearm discharged and it wasnt as if he was handling the firearm or moving it in any way shape or form
341538 they court bailiffs are trained here by trainers who have been trained themselves by police standards and training
341539 as of this fall our training which is now conducted at the administrative office of the courts is going to be conducted at police standards and training but its by our personnel who have been trained
341540 i hate this world my life is horrible goodbye i hope you all have a miserable life expletive you all
341541 joshua was not suicidal when i dropped him off at school that day he came home that way
341542 in total the allegation against allen is that she reported that joshua had candy mints on his table and described those mints as medicine when she knew otherwise in reporting this conduct to the vice principal allen is alleged to have winked thats it
341543 allen herself is not alleged to have participated in any punishment of him as a result of this episode allen is not alleged to have sought to deprive joshua of any opportunity to be schooled in the public system allen is not alleged to have had any knowledge of joshuas probable reaction to her report of alleged wrongdoing
341544 larger effort to build evidence for its case that joshua needed to be designated as learning disabled and or removed from the school
341545 i was sitting there begging them to tell me if my brother was dead or alive
341546 if i talked to my brother he would do what i say because he respected me that much
341547 it shouldnt take five or six days for someone to conjure up what happened they had no reason for even being at tonys trailer as far as we know
341548 i would say he was at the early stages of me turning my life around
341549 tony was that person who didnt care what your background was he was there to listen and to help
341550 everything is hush hush and if the police knew that everything they did was right and by the law then it seems like they would have no problem talking about what happened
341551 we are aware of the situation obviously we the rnc are working with the leadership of the state republican party and were working with the mccain campaign our intent is to satisfy all of the parties and take care of everyones concern
341552 were very much aware of this and committed to making sure that everyone is satisfied
341553 how can the rnc rightfully punish a state for complying with state law our party has no control over when the primary is
341554 shame on the rnc for putting new hampshire is such an awkward position
341555 this is a slap in the face to all new hampshire voters never before has a nominee of either party demonstrated such disrespect for new hampshire and its voters mccains promises are proving to be empty
341556 should demand that mccain keep his word and give full delegate rights to new hampshire at the convention
341557 our goal from the very start is to get people using these resources so they appreciate them and are interested in conserving them
341558 in some conditions it would be for experienced paddlers only
341559 three refreshing scents for a clear mind and a fresh perspective
341560 i am floating around this idea of the covenant of the 130th district which is to declare the district as a zone of tolerance
341561 what we want to do is focus not on law enforcement not on criminalizing addiction not on arrest and incarceration but to shift the effort towards a public health initiative
341562 i feel the war on drugs is your root of most urban issues whether youre talking about public education reform affordable housing job creation social justice fairness and equality
341563 whoever is there has been in jail heading to jail or coming back from jail
341564 be properly screened and their heroin intake would be managed and supervised by a public health official not a law enforcement official
341565 this is not something i want to seriously pursue i would encourage people to look to a candidate who wants to fix the system of school funding rather than creating initiatives that will only create more violence
341566 if a passenger is injured or has a broken bone can someone like me help him i will probably make things worse because i do not have the training
341567 bemerkenswerte wahrheit ber den heutigen kapitalismus in dem das verh ltnis von boom und bubbles von

341571 oh im not sure i even want to apply to college
341572 harvard is a ttt you are all kikes i did your mom last nite
341573 wow i love this card and i cant believe how easy that was
341574 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act
341575 this is an efficient way to add clients and deposits in an attractive long term growth market
341576 well continue to look for attractive opportunities as they present themselves
341577 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
341578 i think it is going to be the biggest show of its type ever seen
341579 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours
341580 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane
341581 but frankly these things go on for too long and it is getting increasingly hard to wow people
341582 people have told me that i looked sad when i was i competing but i never complained
341583 people assume a lot of things about gymnasts that the girls work too hard its way too much for them they are too young to work so hard i never personally complained everybody else complained for me
341584 in any case it was not too hard it was what it takes to be an olympic champion also nobody says anything about boys at 12 13 years old working too hard its only the girls oh poor girls why are we treated differently
341585 i basically have my life today as a result of what i did as a child what did i miss out on yeah i missed not hanging out at shopping malls i guess but that is not a big deal because you dont get a medal for that
341586 when i look back i am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club i didnt join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity it just happened i did more than i expected of course
341587 what is different is that they can make a living from gymnastics and people stay longer in the sport also you dont have to do four events you can specialise in one so that shortens their workout we had to do compulsory as well dont forget
341588 i was a little bit tired especially after a tough win in toronto last week and the weather here is very humid and hot but it is important to be in the semi finals
341589 i am happy because i have been fighting a lot these last three years although i was happy as number two as i won a lot of tournaments
341590 but for sure number one is a goal and i am very happy
341591 if i want to beat djokovic i have to play better than today and have to play my best match in cincinnati for sure
341592 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
341593 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
341594 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
341595 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
341596 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage
341597 you can see water trouble will be stronger in the second half of the year because of these seasonal elements
341598 for example the tsunami took place in december in 2004 usually water is more powerful in the months after august
341599 move on move on folks theres nothing to see here dont step across the boundary line thats it thank you have a nice day

341621 while i understand the need for privacy to protect an individual if its an unfounded allegation
341622 weve been working and really talking about how do we prevent some of the issues that arise rather than just react to them if theres abuse
341623 no s lo es para los ni os sino para toda la familia a veces los pap s piensan oh tengo que llevar a los ni os a disney on ice y una vez en el espect culo quedan encantados incluso los peque os asisten una segunda vez pero ahora de la mano de los abuelos y eso es muy gratificante para nosotros
341624 nos despertamos a primera hora de la ma ana para rezar
341625 las profesoras me dijeron que cerrase la puerta de la cocina nadie estaba asustado y de hecho las estudiantes volvieron a la cama despu s de que subiese al piso de arriba comenz a llegar un olor a gas de los dormitorios de abajo y en seguida se produjo una explosi n muy violenta
341626 estaba con cinco amigas en la parte que hab a quedado en pie del edificio sent amos muy cerca el fuego que ven a de la planta baja cuando abrimos la puerta vimos que la mitad del edificio se hab a derrumbado y que s lo nuestra parte se manten a en pie dos trozos de madera cayeron encima de mi empec a gritar pidiendo ayuda y me rescataron
341627 estoy trabajando por los j venes de este estado y no bajar la guardia se los prometo
341628 nunca me he enriquecido ni lo har con un cargo p blico tengo clara mi conciencia tengo limpias las manos estoy trabajando por los j venes de este estado y no bajar la guardia se los prometo por mi padre que est muerto
341629 nadie ni la m s grande dificultad me impedir que siga haciendo mi trabajo y que siga yendo con los diputados bien nacidos como jos luis i iguez con los presidentes que aman a su pueblo a colocar primeras piedras en las escuelas preparatorias ese es el compromiso que asum como rector general cumplir y hacer cumplir la ley lo har aunque me cueste lo que me cueste
341630 conmino a sus integrantes de rganos de gobierno universitarios a expresar ah todas sus inquietudes y planteamientos bajo esta misma tesitura convoco a los rectores de centro a que hagan lo propio en sus comunidades con la misma pluralidad y apertura que aqu se debatir n todos los temas
341631 penny thanks for sharing that with me it made my day
341632 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
341633 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
341634 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
341635 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
341636 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
341637 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
341638 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
341639 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
341640 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
341641 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
341642 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain is offering
341643 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
341644 while ralph strayhorn has been very instrumental in uniting our two organizations over the past two years the separation was a mutual decision benefiting both parties
341645 this settlement contributed significantly to an internal goal of identifying and extracting 1 5 million or more in annual non interest expense savings
341646 near term last nights report likely had way too many yellow flags for a story the street is already extremely skeptical about
341647 this is why our thesis on hanesbrands is much more holistic than on any other name we cover as we dont think you can judge hanesbrands quarter by quarter
341648 our sourcing strategy for raw materials enabled the company to partially contend with escalating raw materials costs which saw double digit increases during the quarter
341649 while domestic consumption contracted as a result of the prolonged economic slowdown in many of our market segments certain portions of our business remained stable due to the increased volume of synthetic apparel sourced through the cafta region
341650 to better meet changing economic conditions and the changing global economy
341651 the quarter looks like a positive sign but there remains a lot of uncertainty ahead especially given the state of the economy in general and the struggles of key industries and customers here at home
341652 unifi definitely has cut its operating losses but its still a challenge for them to turn leaner and more focused operations into actual operating profits
341653 r j reynolds continues to increase total growth brand market share and the company is generating additional productivity and profit gains
341654 with the improved dynamics in the cigarette marketplace and the continued momentum of conwood and the moist snuff category we are confident that we will achieve our earnings forecast
341655 the game in the tobacco industry is mitigating the industry decline in cigarette sales
341656 reynolds has become especially good at controlling costs and increasing sales of its smokeless brands
341657 we believe reynolds can no longer raise prices unless philip morris usa does as well because the consequence of raising prices ahead of philip morris usa is now an unacceptable loss of volume
341658 we do believe that philip morris usa will start to raise prices but relatively modestly and at a pace to suit altria not reynolds all this combines to mean that reynolds volume performance will be weaker than the other main players in the industry
341659 reynolds is well placed in smokeless and its strongest brands camel and grizzly are growing well
341660 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act
341661 we are very happy to be joining forces with mooresville savings bank as we prepare to expand our banking network into the very attractive lake norman region of north carolina
341662 this represents significant progress toward our strategic plan for expanding in the greater charlotte area where we currently have a loan production office
341663 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
341664 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
341665 we are obviously disappointed with our second quarter results which have been impacted by weakness in the economy
341666 while we will continue to make loans to quality commercial and retail borrowers we are also continuing our efforts to reduce operating expense levels by carefully evaluating every aspect of our banking operations
341667 we are taking a number of steps to prepare the company to emerge from this economic downturn in a strong competitive position
341668 the determination to reduce the cash dividend is one of the most difficult decisions we have had to make
341669 our overriding concern remains the long term success and vitality of our company
341670 the directors believe that they should contribute to the lowering of expenses which should enhance the companys return to higher profitability
341671 newbridges lower second quarter results reflect the difficult operating conditions that virtually all banks are facing today
341672 with respect to the dividend reduction i believe the decision was largely based on the boards commitment to maintain a strong capital base that can position the company for growth once they emerge from this downturn
341673 the severity of the dividend cut was likely motivated by the wish to only reduce it once
341674 glad i bought all 7 new content you will be pleased great seller
341675 if youre a dland fan dont be a fool buy this you need it great seller
341676 dont miss this collection mixed and edited with the skill of an artist love it
341677 how does internet and social media technology apply to me and the larger world
341678 a popular brand of frozen food or laundry detergent is not forced down the consumers throat with an iron fist
341679 the design and marketing methods used to inculcate doctrine and guarantee consumption are fundamentally similar
341680 a friendly face on an otherwise inanimate or sometimes inhumane product
341681 sold her to mr for 500l and entered into the articles never to molest him in the possession of her
341682 the meat tastes like rabbit or the dark meat of chicken in case you were wondering
341683 if france can produce 80 of its electricity with nuclear power why cant we
341684 i wanted to talk to you because im not sure our relationship is working out
341685 what do you mean um youre sending me mixed signals
341686 this new proposed statute will bring our code into the modern global economy
341687 i believe they met with just about every the utility agencies so gpa gwa they met with the port they met with public health ghura so all of the critical delivery agencies and gpss as well
341688 with our current solid waste situation i think everyone realizes that something needs to be done and recycling is one of the easiest ways everyone can contribute
341689 weve got the termite infestation here in this unused dilapidated freezer or chiller
341690 this new proposed statute will bring our code into the modern global economy
341691 i believe they met with just about every the utility agencies so gpa gwa they met with the port they met with public health ghura so all of the critical delivery agencies and gpss as well
341692 with our current solid waste situation i think everyone realizes that something needs to be done and recycling is one of the easiest ways everyone can contribute
341693 after taking a close look at the candidates in this race i was more impressed by senator clintons ability to meet the challenges of the presidency end the war reinvigorate the economy and provide universal healthcare
341694 somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
341695 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together
341696 when we traded for him and bill came to me to tell me about it we really didnt know what to expect but i knew instantly that i liked him
341697 there was a chain link fence running alongside ruston high stadium and fred swung that running back so hard the guy actually got caught underneath that fence
341698 they had to get wire cutters and everything to get this kid out
341699 i dropped the rifle on my toe and it fired
341700 i didnt realize there was still a bullet in the chamber it just went off
341701 i was afraid my mom and the coaches would get on me
341702 he went into the coaches office grabbed a doughnut and a cup of coffee and lifted up his jersey and showed them the bullet hole then they took him to the hospital and fred was afraid of needles
341703 coach walsh changed my life and so did mr d
341704 he was the most explosive undersized pass rusher i have ever seen he never lifted weights just did incredible things on the field
341705 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
341706 and that made me realize how great an owner he was and how much i finally belonged
341707 my father always said wait until its all signed on the dotted line
341708 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
341709 i had assumed as had everyone else that the men on board were all british
341710 nobody had considered a naval vessel would have a huge foreign component to it which is a little shocking
341711 the reason the mary rose sank is because there was very poor communication between the crew because you have this really large foreign contingent and they probably did make a bad manoeuvre and that was probably the reason the ship sank
341712 they were involved in a lot of moving around and there was trade and particular nationalities were fighting as mercenaries for different countries
341713 the spanish part surprises me a little bit because spain and britain generally did not get on
341714 we couldnt even bring him home they didnt know what this sniper guy would do and they didnt want to endanger anyone else
341715 its so senseless why would anyone shoot at these kids they were just having fun
341716 some of them were able to escape some were not
341717 she had lots of energy and a pretty smile that was on her face most of the time
341718 she was the kind of student that when you ran into her in the hallways you just said wow what a positive outlook she has on life
341719 our goal is to reach out personally to every family affected by this incident and to assist as necessary while the boys recover
341720 it looks a lot like a boy scout camp down there
341721 you could tell people were surprised and somewhat shook up
341722 were continuing to move mario around to both sides mario is not improving the way wed like him to so well just continue to push him but its not close right now
341723 im happy of course to still be in the league
341724 im used to starting from the ground up its just that when you come here you dont have any scholarships you cant sit around for four years you better get it now i still can get cut drafted or not
341725 i just have to work hard to show them that i was worth that pick that i was picked at
341726 never contribute your own money to yours or anyone elses political campaign
341727 one of the world wide webs most distinguished organs of fake news the borowitz report leads its current issue with this flash
341728 the liberal blogosphere was aflame today with new accusations that sen
341729 a new mccain ad calls obama a celebrity true who says hell raise taxes on electricity false
341730 a mccain tv spot falsely insinuates that obama canceled his visit to injured troops because the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
341731 under the radar mccain web ad quotes the cubans i e fidel castros praise but omits his criticism
341732 mccain ad says obamas the guy to thank for emptying our wallets at the filling station we say thats ridiculous
341733 a mccain tv ad says obama voted against funding our troops he did once every other time he voted in favor
341734 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
341735 it is not i repeat not the policy of the department of defense the national science foundation or those nincompoops over at commerce to build out a resilient multi carrier settlement free packet network simply to shut down residential mimeographs
341736 you are a beautiful mermaid i know you are youre a mermaid
341737 imaginary pennies can make real wishes take this imaginary penny and throw it
341738 i wished for mommy to be here and she didnt come
341739 i said that i dont dance as much as other people in the us and as i was playing around with my gloves the girl asked me about it and i asked her if she wants me to make a glove mate she said yes and i went to put hot water into the glove and tied the bottom
341740 introduced a lot of confusion and uncertainty into the linux market which could dampen some of the future growth
341741 the sco lawsuit raises thorny intellectual property issues and analysts say poses the potential for more court battles as other companies assert rights to some of the communal code
341742 a team at redmond tasked with the assignment of studying the linux phenomena and trying to decipher a way to stop it
341743 you cant take back the fact that someone has tried to claim intellectual property on linux the genie is out of the bottle
341744 linux customers and vendors will be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues
341745 the lawsuit represents more than just a licensing squabble between two companies or the efforts of a small unix linux company to dig into the deep pockets of ibm
341746 be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues around linux and open source software
341747 some firms will put them linux deployments on hold until they get better clarity
341748 you wont see this thing settled for quite a while
341749 as the two products are integrated we have two or three fairly major products that will be released this fall we believe that solution set will give us a tremendous bridge for our current customer base to move forward on the new platforms
341750 educating people is fairly high on the list of marketing activities they should be engaged in
341751 but when someone makes a decision that theyre going to use linux the question we keep asking is is red hat going to get paid
341752 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity
341753 in the end what it all means ill have to leave to others
341754 with a number of new versions of products coming out this year customers may choose to take the new versions of products and drop their maintenance agreements since these products most likely wont be updated for a number of years
341755 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity
341756 part of the settlement is an agreement to keep the terms and evidence secret so the public will never get the chance to see just how badly microsoft did or didnt behave a decade ago when it was in the middle of its rise to power
341757 were going to make sure that the palestinians have a state that allows them to prosper as long as we also have certainty that israels security is not being compromised
341758 i think its in the interest of both parties but we are the critical ingredient in terms of making sure that a deal actually gets done
341759 then that will make it easier for arab states and the gulf states to support us when it comes to issues like iraq and afghanistan
341760 it also will weaken iran which has been using hamas and hezbollah as a way to stir up mischief in the region if weve gotten an israeli palestinian peace deal maybe at the same time peeling syria out of the iranian orbit that makes it easier to isolate iran so that they have a tougher time developing a nuclear weapon
341761 give s the bush administration credit that the annapolis process has gotten prime minister ehud olmert and president mahmoud abbas to have very serious discussions they may not be able to finish the job they certainly cant finish it without serious participation by the next administration and weve got to start early
341762 the middle east is not going to get better without the creation of a palestinian state to live side by side with israel in peace security and democracy
341763 accept that some days youre the pigeon and some days youre the statue
341764 if you cant be kind at least have the decency to be vague
341765 always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it
341766 you may be only one person in the world but you may also be the world to one person
341767 i dont want to be a disruption to the team and ive heard nick is a little out there so im going to stick with 17 and be happy with it
341768 if you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all
341769 if he cheated with you hell surely cheat on you
341770 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
341771 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
341772 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
341773 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
341774 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
341775 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
341776 based on the discovery ive been given by the district attorney i believe his case should be handled in the juvenile courts
341777 no one other than the juvenile had any physical contact with the police
341778 we gave birth to the spirit name we came up with it what has sydney done to deserve it clark said
341779 it was quite interesting to read that because weve received a verbal commitment as well
341780 i looked at that herald sun article with some interest but from our point of view we havent been sitting back on our hands waiting for julius hodge to decide whether hes going to come back or not
341781 the club has made offers to the top teams in china korea the philippines and also australia a couple of teams are very interested in playing
341782 so we might still play a couple of nbl sides this year
341783 those guys were left with nothing while we have had our contracts guaranteed and are still training together
341784 i have a contract for the next eight months so i will be able to keep playing professional basketball
341785 we would have given the nbl a real shake this season
341786 we have a great group here and have been looking great
341787 i am sad i wont be coming back to australia as much this season but we have a great group here
341788 the club wants to start a new asian league next year so these matches could be the start of that
341789 president emmert is making sure he is getting the right person and hes not trying to meet any self proclaimed deadlines he wants to make the right decision for the future of washington athletics
341790 i am just leaving it in the hands of emmert
341791 i am not really hearing much but i trust mark completely
341792 no everything is pretty much taken care of for next season anyway you dont want to rush the decision
341793 what you want is a talented person whos best equipped to serve the student athletes because they are the clients
341794 there are some short term challenges but its a first rate place and there is no reason why the new ad shouldnt be successful the school has all of the advantages that you could want
341795 due to contracts that are allegedly fubar and associated wrangling the navajo nation is
341796 is there a place for an inexpensive ham technogeek foss solution that could bypass the antics of the for pay providers

341798 it is not worthwhile to try to keep history from repeating itself for mans character will always make the preventing of the repetitions impossible
341799 what if you have a sol lewitt and the work is not an object but a certificate
341800 or you have a dan flavin and the work is a fluorescent lightbulb and the kind he used is going obsolete
341801 where you cant preserve the materials because it was an event how do you conserve that
341802 i think as a society we have a hard time with death and art that has a steep degradation curve way shorter than a human lifetime that makes us very uncomfortable certainly there have been replicas throughout history but it feels like this scramble now is a symptom of not being able to let go
341803 worlds first extensive gallery of street art by bristol graffiti artist banksy
341804 i dont agree with auction houses selling street art its undemocratic it glorifies greed and i never see any of the money none of the print and painting exhibitions in proper art galleries are anything to do with me its all stuff they bought previously i only ever mount shows in warehouses or war zones or places full of live animals im aware the pictures dont stand up on their own
341805 like many i do believe the real home for banksys art is on walls of streets but unfortunately much of his work has now been removed here i have created an opportunity to view it all or nearly all together i think viewing his work in this way helps to reflect the creative journey banksy has taken and shows how his ideas and techniques have progressed through time
341806 no he firmado para trabajar con britney spears estos post de aclaraci n ser lo nuevo que hare para negar falsos rumores cortos y precisos
341807 kathy dickinson 2 1 2 of 3290 jackson st leans over the work of sculptor elio benvenuto on display at the 14th annual free art festival of the san francisco art commission which opened today at civic center too young to read titles she was unaware that the anchor like sculpture actually is titled trojan horse
341808 in my regularly scheduled life at the new york times i cover the art world but i grew up in texas in a small cotton farming town in the panhandle near lubbock so its been nice to come back here to watch the state in electoral thrall by the time i became aware of politics here in the 1970s i remember gov dolph briscoe coming through our town on a campaign swing with lots of bunting and a truckload of barbecued buffalo meat my corner of the state had pretty much already made its transition from yellow dog democrat to republican so its been strange and fascinating for me as it has for many of the people ive talked to around the state even staunch republicans to see a democratic race matter here so much
341809 the capacity to hold our attention in the moment or in reflection later is a mark of significant art in an era when mass media work hard to abbreviate attention spans so as to cut costs and decapitate questions
341810 things got a little wild when david choe finished his 48 hour installation a spray painted graffiti inspired mural the prolific artist known for his comic books but also infamous for having been arrested in japan for tagging and getting in a scuffle with the authorities threw 50 ninja stars at it requiring the hurried construction of a barrier and warning signs so no one would get too close
341811 the morning of the gr biennal show at the japanese american national museum david rolled into town from vegas at 7 am
341812 if going to a museum is seen as a kind of airport lounge experience you have to accept that art can easily turn into stuff meaning that viewers will experience mostly accumulation rather than sublimation
341813 life is long if you know how to use it
341814 that day will mark a precedent which brings no news of rockwell kent
341815 dk 3713 final fantasy vii ac to include final fantasy xiii demo ps3 bundle
341816 today we see the tangible evidence of a dream coming true
341817 its even more exciting to be able to say that this vehicle and the fleet to follow are being built by california hands
341818 reality star of a certain age trying to front as a roadie for willie nelson
341819 her kicks arent as high as they need to be
341820 i was just emptying your wastebasket i think everything is all right
341821 i needed to investigate your activities and have noticed many things are suspiciously askew but i guess since you havent pulled the chandelier out of the ceiling ill let it slide
341822 the news might be just another spin of edf to try to bring the price down
341823 if edf looks like its winning others like iberdrola or rwe will reconsider their positions they cannot afford a scenario where edf takes a dominant position in the british market as they are keen to be involved in the nuclear generation process
341824 and british energy will fight tooth and nail to get a higher bid close to 800 pence per share edf is not at the levels shareholders hope the offer to be
341825 we could potentially see a renewed interest from iberdrola although they say they are stepping out of the race for british energy
341826 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
341827 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
341828 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
341829 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
341830 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
341831 on a year over year basis we saw significant improvements across a number of key operating metrics ranging from gross margins to non gaap earnings per share and cash flow from operations
341832 despite this progress and strong growth in international geographies slowing performance in the u s impacted top line revenue growth looking forward we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings from the opensolaris tm operating system and the mysql tm database to the lustre tm and zfs tm storage systems the foundation of our open storage platforms
341833 we believe that politicizing the olympics does not favor resolving these issues and also violates the olympic spirit
341834 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
341835 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
341836 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
341837 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
341838 only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
341839 but i would like to let you know that since the lineup of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted
341840 development will in no way affect or threaten the interests of others
341841 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation
341842 our work shows that the original method developed by yamanaka works great
341843 it opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines to treat diseases that affect people very late in life like parkinsons or alzheimers disease
341844 our lack of understanding of the disease process is preventing us from developing more efficient cures
341845 because the disease is happening in the spinal cord we dont have access to living samples of neurons undergoing the disease process but now we have in the culture dish the very cells affected by the disease
341846 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
341847 the second part of my plan is a 50 billion stimulus to help jump start job creation and help local communities that are struggling due to our economic downturn half of this stimulus will go to state governments that are facing big budget shortfalls the other half of this stimulus will be used to invest in our national infrastructure replenish the highway trust fund rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges and repair our crumbling schools
341848 obama is proposing to pay for these rebate checks with a windfall profits tax that would apply to some of the excess profits that oil companies have made not because of their investments not because of their ingenuity and skill but simply because of the high oil prices that were facing today
341849 this is a stark contrast from john mccain who rather than giving relief directly to families would instead give oil companies whatever they want the mccain plan does not just fail to get money directly to families but it also would be a large increase in the budget deficit and would do that on a permanent basis
341850 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
341851 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
341852 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying
341853 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
341854 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
341855 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
341856 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
341857 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
341858 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
341859 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong
341860 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are
341861 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
341862 we need to identify these people and weed them out
341863 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
341864 we dont believe the governor has the has the authority to lay off state workers by executive fiat and thats what that executive order does
341865 steam validation rejected i installed steam from internet installed it but still getting the same prob
341866 when a hall of famer is coaching you you listen
341867 he knows this game and not just football he knows arena football as well as anyone ive ever met there are coaches that understand how to coach football but not all of them know arena football especially quarterbacks
341868 whenever i talk to him during a game hes always under control he never spazzes out and he knows what i did right and what i did wrong
341869 every situation has been different and all have been challenges this year has certainly been different ive never had a team had so much turnover
341870 im not looking to move but ive learned to never say never in this game wherever i go has to be in a good situation money isnt the end all be all
341871 measure the peaks and create a bar graph depicting size and relative age of each
341872 who can tell me how long it has been since this counter was last cleaned
341873 alright children pick a corner of the room find a food and determine its age and original identity
341874 hmmm looks like we need a biopsy get the pizza scissors and salad tongs
341875 he is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
341876 pelos jogadores que a gente est perdendo toda hora estamos fazendo at demais estamos em uma situa o muito boa temos lan ados meninos porque temos que lan ar na hora em que tivermos um plantel definido vamos brigar pelo titulo

341878 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
341879 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
341880 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
341881 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
341882 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
341883 our country craves raw reality our christianity is the same we want a faith that is as raw and fresh as sushi
341884 desconhe o essa situa o totalmente estou aqui s para competir e tentar fazer o melhor resultado na olimp ada n o tenho nada a falar desconhe o essa situa o fui pego de surpresa

341891 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
341892 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
341893 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston

341895 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
341896 im just going to be manny and play the game
341897 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
341898 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
341899 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
341900 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
341901 im going to stare at you until you fall under my power
341902 the fiery insides that makes the kind of leader you want to follow
341903 tony blair signed up to eu plans that signaled death across europe for traditional style bulbs earlier this year
341904 would not liberty be more valuable for your opinion there
341905 we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard
341906 a political independent with strong atheistic beliefs ex highschool dropout who realized he screwed up went back to school and got a 2 year degree with his own money finally figured out the most important thing you can do is learn
341907 minister and three members of the des moines catholic workers community
341908 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
341909 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
341910 already more than 1 6 million people have contacted the fcc and congress to protect net neutrality
341911 man i really wish i could read this persons username twice
341912 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
341913 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
341914 if the mail that i was sending contained items that broke the law i could hardly complain if the post office refused to deliver it
341915 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
341916 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
341917 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
341918 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
341919 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
341920 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
341921 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
341922 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
341923 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
341924 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
341925 there are so many positives this site makes the high school a centerpiece for the community and there is a lot of potential for developing partnerships with the village it will save money because we can tie into the villages sewer and water system which will cost 1 200 at the other site we would have had to tie into the county and that would cost 70 000
341926 when mr diglia called me about the position it took me by surprise but the more my wife elaine and i talked about it it started to make sense i began my career as an elementary teacher and then elementary principal and now i can end it that way as well
341927 i have met a lot of the teachers and staff and they have made us feel very welcome and i am looking forward to working in an excellent school with a very supportive staff much like i enjoyed in delphos
341928 he was just happy go lucky very bright excited about his medical profession
341929 they said we dont know the circumstances but we do know hes missing in action
341930 they found evidence that linked back specifically to bobby that evidence is in the form of a blood chit a military identification marker
341931 they do believe theres a good chance theyll find remains and if so thats just icing on the cake
341932 the reason weve accomplished what we have is because of the national league of families keeping the pressure on the government and the issue alive before the american people
341933 as a christian i know im going to be face to face with my brother one day and i want him to be proud of what weve done
341934 western ohio is seeing a renewed interest in companies taking a look at areas of the state to do energy development some companies are large some are medium size and some are small but we have identified 17 different energy development companies talking with farmers and offering leasing agreements in northwest ohio in the last year
341935 northwest ohio has the needed wind resource for utility scale wind development there are other states with better wind resources i call the dakotas the saudi arabia of wind because they have wonderful wind resources and so do kansas and nebraska however we have something they dont have fully developed and thats the electric transmission infrastructure those transmission towers you see out in the fields connect communities from the carolinas to illinois and from the eastern seaboard to manitoba there are two systems and they both pass through northwest ohio so we have these networks and the electricity generated by wind turbines can be put on a transmission grid and transported to a number of utilities service providers and communities
341936 theyre looking at small wind based generation around 10 15 turbines of 20 megawatt capacity some are looking at networking over two or three townships based on ohios topography to do larger numbers of 50 100 megawatts
341937 a cluster of turbines on 300 acres of open land is ideal and more turbines equals a lower cost for each unit
341938 ohio is second only to california in its capacity to manufacture wind turbine parts
341939 for the people of good taste who grace todays town and country homes we present this truly outstanding collection of design color and texture
341940 in the consumer market sensor cleaning and ubiquitous vr via the sensor and live view all got established by competitors well before nikon did it thats going to shift a bit with the d90 i think

341942 quello che voglio far sapere al santo padre ha detto che in questo periodo damasco la capitale della cultura araba e nello stesso tempo la capitale dellanno di san paolo
341943 sarei tanto lieto se il santo padre volesse accettare il nostro invito a visitare la siria in questanno
341944 la cultura dello spirito sia essa cristiana o musulmana conferisce allumanit la sua dimensione morale
341945 il vaticano possa avere un qualche ruolo nel piantare il fiore della pace nel vicino oriente
341946 si litiga con la moglie ma lamore si accresce ha commentato in fondo fra religiosi intellettuali non c litigio ma dialogo e discussione e io spero che il santo padre abbia un ruolo fondamentale nella pace del mondo
341947 il vaticano ha avuto un ruolo fondamentale nellabbattimento del muro di berlino ha osservato e spero che possa giocare un ruolo simile nel distruggere il muro che si sta costruendo nella terra della pace
341948 si litiga con la moglie ma lamore si accresce ha commentato in fondo fra religiosi intellettuali non c litigio ma dialogo e discussione e io spero che il santo padre abbia un ruolo fondamentale nella pace del mondo

341950 shes so versatile and does everything you ask of her
341951 hes a colt we bought at the chesapeake sale as a yearling he raced a little bit as a two year old
341952 hes come back better this year grew up matured and really started to race well he loves to race and always gives you a real good effort
341953 yeah its been slow but things are slowly coming around
341954 mentally its competition always there its sometimes difficult but its always fun to compete
341955 shes definitely a fast filly but i think shes just learning how to trot
341956 oh yeah i knew him what a class gentleman and a great horseman he was on the big circuit in his day 50s amp 60s
341957 dr mitchell is a great american but we do not share his opinion on this issue
341958 you may remember that this may a french company named areva selected bonneville county as the future home of a 2 billion uranium enrichment plant its first such plant in the united states
341959 rather than voting on adjournment congress should be debating long term efforts to increase production of american energy including drilling in anwr and offshore we should be voting to remove restrictions on the development of oil shale increase the number of nuclear power facilities advance hydro and wind power and incentivize new technologies such as hydrogen and electric automobiles
341960 its a win win situation because the inmates get an opportunity to do something besides count bricks
341961 tax assessment appeals jump in ada county ada developers with lots they cant sell boost property valuation protests to a record high
341962 c ountries like iran use bloated oil revenues to pursue a nuclear program that creates security concerns for the rest of the world if taxes are raised on oil companies it is silly to believe that will cause them to lower their prices in fact it will only cause prices at the pump to go up even higher as those oil companies pass that tax increase right down the pipeline and into your gas tank by raising taxes were actually taxing the people who invest in energy companies many of whom are middle income people with retirement accounts higher taxes on oil companies will only take money from retirement accounts and hurt ordinary americans
341963 some people blame those who own and manage american oil companies
341964 seriously shut up you guys are over get over it
341965 life both before and during the conflict does indeed suck for recruits joker pyle and cowboy

341969 tuink2 ketika sk ku menanyakan kenapa adik ga sholat padahal setiap muslim memiliki kewajiban untuk itu
341970 tidaklah bermanfaat lagi iman seseorang bagi dirinya sendiri yang belum beriman sebelum itu atau dia belum mengusahakan kebaikan dalam masa imannya
341971 apabila harta orang kafir yang dihalalkan tanpa perang yang dijadikan pembahagian bergilir amanat dijadikan seperti harta rampasan zakat dijadikan seperti pinjaman belajar lain daripada agama orang lelaki taat kepada isterinya mendurhakai ibunya lebih rapat dengan teman dan menjauhkan ayahnya suara suara lantang dalam masjid pemimpin kaum dipilih dari orang yang fasik orang dimuliakan kerana ditakuti akan tindakan jahat dan aniayanya dan bukan kerana takutkan allah maka kesemua itu adalah tanda tanda kiamat
341972 the charwoman whose pantomimed mishaps often brought her into the shadow of greatness became the shows trademark a caricature of the dusty maid adorned credits and teasers for the program
341973 family guy like the carol burnett show is famous for its pop culture parodies and satirical jabs at celebrities we are surprised that ms burnett who has made a career of spoofing others on television would go so far as to sue family guy for a simple bit of comedy
341974 esta propuesta demuestra una vez m s el desinter s de bres por la protecci n y conservaci n de nuestra zona boscosa del vedat si primero fue la creaci n de una cafeter a en la antigua pista de la tortuga ahora asistimos a otro desprop sito mayor la zona elegida para la instalaci n deportiva se ver afectada por el n mero de participantes que acudan a sus instalaciones veh culos y contaminaci n ac stica por no hablar de la p rdida de masa forestal y la fauna que en ella habita
341975 este hecho demuestra que bres quiere desarrollar este proyecto a toda prisa sin concurso sin consultar con entidades ecologistas ni siquiera con el resto de grupos pol ticos esta propuesta pensamos que se trata de una medida electoralista y absolutamente desacertada
341976 no es de recibo que el pp se dedique a difundir bulos sobre una instalaci n que ha cumplido escrupulosamente todos los tr mites necesarios para su puesta en marcha si no est n de acuerdo en su instalaci n que aporten argumentos y los defiendan pero entrar en temas de legalidad y cuestionar el trabajo de los t cnicos municipales y los de la propia conselleria no me parece correcto
341977 que no manipule m s y que nos deje trabajar tranquilos para dar servicios a los ciudadanos
341978 y si de verdad creen que estamos actuando en contra de ley que vaya a los estamentos oportunos y denuncie lo que crea oportuno pero que deje de una vez por todas de intoxicar con noticias falsas a los ciudadanos
341979 nicamente hab a un rbol totalmente descalzado con signos inequ vocos de haber sido arrancado por el viento
341980 durante los ltimos a os la delegaci n de medio ambiente ha hecho un gran esfuerzo por defender el patrimonio de nuestra ciudad y se ha protegido el vedat la serra perenxisa el barranco y hasta una especie en peligro de extinci n
341981 en elecciones nos comprometimos a desmantelarlo y as va a ser no se ha abierto ni se va a abrir se va a desmontar en breve en cuesti n de semanas
341982 esto era una mejora del servicio de limpieza que lo desmonten y lo instalen en otra poblaci n queremos recibir esa mejora de otra forma
341983 los vecinos estar n m s tranquilos el d a en que eso est en funcionamiento
341984 afortunadamente la mayor a de los ciudadanos de torrent han entendido el problema y han pagado masivamente y aunque reconocemos que nadie va a pagar contento cada vez los vecinos son m s sensibles a los problemas medioambientales que generamos todos y que la generalitat no ha sabido resolver

341986 pese a que estas sentencias nicamente anulan los recibos de los particulares demandantes se puede decir que existe jurisprudencia que reconoce la ilegalidad de esta tasa no se trata de dos casos concretos la tasa es igual de injusta e ilegal para todos y no es justo el pago que han realizado los vecinos de torrent ni que el ayuntamiento siga cobrando en 2007
341987 honradez y prudencia para que no se siga cobrando un recibo muy cuestionado ya legalmente hay antecedentes suficientes en esta materia que avalan la ilegalidad de estos recibos un alcalde honrado paralizar a completamente su emisi n los vecinos no deben pagar un recibo ilegal y el ayuntamiento no puede hacer o dos sordos ante esta situaci n

341997 he is a white middle aged overweight man with black hair and a receding hairline sitting in an armchair wearing a white tank top and blue pants
341998 the issue of copying can be broken down into two subissues the first is whether the alleged copier had access to the work that he is claimed to have copied the second is whether if so he used his access to copy
341999 access does not entail copying an eyewitness might have seen the defendant buy the copyrighted work this would be proof of access but not copying
342000 if therefore two works are so similar as to make it highly improbable that the later one is a copy of the earlier one the issue of access need not be addressed separately since if the later work was a copy its creator must have had access to the original
342001 inference of access and hence of copying could be rebutted by proof that the creator of the later would could not have seen the earlier one
342002 not since the time of the phoenicians have two works borne such similarities similarities that could only arise through copying
342003 novelty wants us to take the entity that is fred subtract each element that it contends is common and then consider whether novelty copied whatever leftover elements are creative but this ignores the fact that the details the appearance of f reds face or even his chair represent creative expression it is not the idea of a farting crude man that is protected but this particular embodiment of that concept novelty could have created another plush doll of a middle aged farting man that would look nothing like fred he could for example have a blond mullet and wear flannel have a nose that is drawn on rather than protruding substantially from the rest of the head be standing rather than ensconced in an armchair and be wearing shorts rather than blue pants

342006 investigate indications that infringement is in the offing even if in the course of the investigation it learns that infringement has not yet occurred
342007 a lthough ordinarily a uk act is not to be construed by reference to a later international treaty i note that lord hoffman considered trips to be of relevance to our domestic copyright law in designers guild here the position is clearer because we are dealing with eu law the ecj has held that trips to which the eu as well as its member states is a party is relevant to the construction of earlier eu legislation concerned with intellectual property
342008 i am not happy with the softer approach taken by the commission in regulating this area which is of growing economic importance
342009 it requires more than just soft law to open up this market a binding legal instrument is needed
342010 the commission wishes to note that the online market is still only in a stage of development we need to be especially careful not to limit its potential by adopting an overly inflexible approach
342011 we dont want unrestrained competition at any cost we feel a law is needed to ensure competition while at the same time guaranteeing cultural diversity around europe and protecting the interests of smaller lesser known artists who might suffer if competition drove down royalties too far

342049 we are not prepared to hold that a commercial composer can plagiarize a competitors copyrighted song substitute dirty lyrics of his own perform it for commercial gain and then escape liability by calling the end result a parody or satire on the mores of society
342050 in my view the defendants use of dirty lyrics or of language and allusions that i might personally find distasteful or even offensive is wholly irrelevant to the issue before us which is whether the defendants use obscene or not is permissible under the fair use doctrine as it has evolved over the year we cannot under the guise of deciding a copyright issue act as a board of censors outlawing xrated performances

342209 i think there were some things going on with the team that were real not just imagined
342210 we were having a difficult time it wasnt any one persons fault but there was a dynamic that had been created that made it more difficult to play at our best for the players to perform
342211 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
342212 you cant go into a trade deadline thinking that you absolutely have to move one player at all costs

342356 in reality its likely that some of your initial assumptions are pretty good and others arent going to be worth the paper theyre written on

342358 but maybe youd be better off renting a stand and testing what the demand is for your products at that location

342374 motorists should allow extra time when traveling on the inbound parkway north
342375 would justify anonymity in virtually every jury trial whether or not it attracts media attention since almost all defendants have friends and enemies who might be inclined to influence jurors
342376 of course in a given case a risk of jury tampering or excessive media harassment may exist
342377 but we are satisfied that district judges are well positioned to address these risks on a case by case basis and in such cases to make particularized findings on the record
342378 all jurors shall be identified in court during the jury selection process by his her assigned juror number only a prospective juror shall no longer be identified by or identify himself or herself by name
342379 should create a precedent that makes it clear that in most circumstances the use of a truly anonymous jury will not be proper
342380 it amounts to impermissible micromanagement of procedures and decisions that are properly delegated to the discretion of district judges

342385 an aging heavily traveled highway built in the mid 20th century it will be an expensive repair project over the next decade
342386 ironic that mr markosek is now calling for expedited approval of the i 80 tolls when the state took from december until late july to resubmit its application
342387 the turnpike commission and penndot waffled over this application for seven long months said peterson aide patrick creighton

342394 forensic under fire are bad science and dueling experts corrupting criminal justice
342395 the inability of our 21st century judicial system to properly differentiate between valid research and junk science
342396 the csi effect has also caused jurors to expect crime lab results far beyond the capacity of forensic science
342397 have kept scientific crime detection from living up to its full potential
342398 the less the forensic scientist knows about the crime the better
342399 make the civil and criminal justice systems more scientific and more objective to make them more just
342400 we should be ashamed of ourselves for not doing this

342408 im just so very puzzled as to what could have happened because they were such good pilots
342409 these guys honestly were the nicest two men you could ever meet and they were the most careful men you could ever meet
342410 there was no failure of the aircraft all pieces were there it was nothing more than a stall spin which happens in landing situations when the pilots attention is diverted
342411 this gentleman ended up letting the plane get too slow
342412 what happened here is a classic example of individuals who come to oshkosh
342413 theyre so interested in getting here that they have no experience in going into a high traffic volume area theres a natural amount of apprehension and fear
342414 it was always his dream to fly my husband was a good pilot in fact he has a plane of his own which is still housed at the hangar
342415 roger was an excellent pilot very conscientious particular about keeping his airplane up to spec
342416 one builder told me its my butt 3 000 feet above the ground doing 150 miles an hour
342417 my husband was a perfectionist about everything he did and the only thing i can say is that at least he passed away doing something he loved

342437 when i first arrived at buffalo one of our biggest challenges was familiarizing recruits with the tremendous academic institution we have now people around the country are getting to see a growing football program with a great academic reputation
342438 they dont give us a chance to get our feet in so i dont think thats fair for us
342439 its making it more challenging it makes us work a little harder
342440 it really helps especially on those out passes you can have a chance even if he catches the ball to hit him and get him out of bounds
342441 i know in the years ive played everythings leaned toward the offense so its finally one leaning our way
342442 it doesnt look like its going to be a good one but well wait and see but anticipate that hes not going to be playing much football this year
342443 this is the first time ive played really well in a united states tournament
342444 i was pretty nervous for awhile i kept hitting good shots and he flores kept getting up and down from incredible places
342445 i was hitting it really well and was comfortable with what i was doing i just kept focusing on my game
342446 we believe that politicising the olympics does not favour resolving these issues and also violates the olympic spirit
342447 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
342448 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
342449 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
342450 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
342451 having the tournament come to our area is an honor as they could have picked another area other than newfane

342469 without the right to our programming service dish is not able to offer abc programming in this market
342470 we owe that to our viewers to reach a mutually acceptable agreement one thats fair and reasonable for both parties
342471 citadel communications is demanding unreasonable contract terms and an excessive rate increase for continued carriage on dish network
342472 we are confident that the proposal that we have in front of dish is fair and it is reasonable and it reflects where the market should be

342474 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
342475 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day

342477 since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town and not bothering anyone anymore thank god and ah evidently ah lindsay lohan has gone gay ah we dont seem to have much of an issue if the ones that attract the paparazzi would behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 of the problem the rest of it we can deal with
342478 my sister is gay so lets get off that angle
342479 the police shouldnt get involved in other peoples personal lives its inappropriate
342480 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
342481 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapist
342482 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
342483 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

342485 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

342495 introduced a lot of confusion and uncertainty into the linux market which could dampen some of the future growth
342496 the sco lawsuit raises thorny intellectual property issues and analysts say poses the potential for more court battles as other companies assert rights to some of the communal code
342497 a team at redmond tasked with the assignment of studying the linux phenomena and trying to decipher a way to stop it
342498 you cant take back the fact that someone has tried to claim intellectual property on linux the genie is out of the bottle
342499 linux customers and vendors will be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues
342500 the lawsuit represents more than just a licensing squabble between two companies or the efforts of a small unix linux company to dig into the deep pockets of ibm
342501 be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues around linux and open source software
342502 some firms will put them linux deployments on hold until they get better clarity
342503 you wont see this thing settled for quite a while
342504 as the two products are integrated we have two or three fairly major products that will be released this fall we believe that solution set will give us a tremendous bridge for our current customer base to move forward on the new platforms
342505 educating people is fairly high on the list of marketing activities they should be engaged in
342506 but when someone makes a decision that theyre going to use linux the question we keep asking is is red hat going to get paid
342507 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity
342508 in the end what it all means ill have to leave to others
342509 with a number of new versions of products coming out this year customers may choose to take the new versions of products and drop their maintenance agreements since these products most likely wont be updated for a number of years
342510 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity
342511 part of the settlement is an agreement to keep the terms and evidence secret so the public will never get the chance to see just how badly microsoft did or didnt behave a decade ago when it was in the middle of its rise to power

342517 its been over 6 years since the us entered afghanistan to crush the repressive taliban and crush al qaeda the taliban have regrouped when al qaeda disappeared into the mountains the us pulled back remember osama bin laden his whereabouts are unknown maybe in pakistan its been over 5 years since the us entered iraq to get those weapons of mass destruction that were north south east and west of baghdad weapons of mass destruction didnt even have to say what they were to dupe america oh for those of you who still believe iraq had weapons of mass destruction give it up not there its all such a huge mass of cynicism and lies and hypocricy and incompetence that i cant really find a good way to tackle it but there is this our official count of dead american soldiers in iraq is near 4 000 and the cost of george bushs romantic adventure to iraq is about 3 trillion dollars and no one weve elected has the courage or good sense to mention that somebody has to pay for it today the us government started using your money my money to prop up wall street theres still no policy proposed to pay for any of this stuff and here in missoula were still looking for handouts from the federal government hell they might as well send us a few billion its all free money

342559 thats good that they caught him justice has finally been served see if they finally do anything
342560 there were fears that mexican officials would not allow reyes to be extradited to texas where he could face the death penalty mexico does not extradite prisoners who may face execution the mexican government is cooperating however due to prosecutors promising not to seek the death penalty for reyes the goodwin family hopes that reyes will be extradited in april or may and that they will have their day in court soon matt smith kntu news

342646 this is a great fight for the fans we both throw a lot of punches so it will be an exciting bout juan is a real good guy we were on opposite teams during the show but we got along although i will do my best to stop him its not personal just business
342647 like every other fight i come for the victory he has something that i want and im sure he feels the same way were both going out there to give it our best and the best man is going to win
342648 having my father ringside makes all my hard work and training worth it i have a legacy to carry on the torch has been passed onto me i will not let my fans or family down
342649 ive been working out for hours every day and i feel great
342650 at 168 my punches are sharper and harder my speed is still there and i feel like i can jump in the ring right now
342651 pavlik was the better man that night but that fight is in the past

342654 reviewing work plans for advisory committees to ensure the committees have an opportunity to review and provide input on issues in the early stages of development
342655 i can definitely understand and relate maybe hell be next to me in an adjacent locker and we can chat and laugh about it
342656 i didnt want to leave there were we the only ones that have gone through it theres a track record i played with mo vaughn i played with roger clemens
342657 the only thing that bothers me now is that people thats all they want to talk about
342658 i threw better than that all year and they want to talk about one pitch
342659 ill never forget i got a call and someone said bob died and i said bob theres a lot of bobs on the pirates
342660 and they told me moose geez i felt so bad i flew down to pittsburgh for the funeral and i tell ya that was a sad sad funeral because at the time i think his daughter was only four years old it was tough
342661 im about meeting girls im about meeting guys im scoresman
342662 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem the report continues and what ive also said is if people are expecting short term relief because of offshore drilling then theyre not going to find it because we wont see a drop of oil for at least a decade
342663 we are very excited about mark davis who was the 2005 and 2006 national champion at 125 trainer mark davis sr and adviser joe delguyd were very easy to deal with as we structured the deal with them
342664 and now with fire in your loins you look at chris and say
342665 im about meeting girls im about meeting guys im scoresman

342668 im not good at dealing with emotion im too empathetic thats both a help and a hindrance when youre there to make a judicial finding you should be able to make it without having to blow your nose
342669 i have never regretted the role or what i have heard seen or felt but each time i walked away from the courthouse i have had to leave the emotions in the courtroom
342670 that would have been the most difficult because even today there has never been any trace of the boat or the two men for their families that unknown must be so hard and all i had to go by were some possibilities raised from the investigation i could not give those families any answers i guess there is never real closure in a case like that
342671 there was leeanne rimene and that beautiful little boy te reo who died in 2006 i looked at her partner who was still feeling so confused and hurting and i felt for them no one could have prevented their deaths but it is not easy
342672 no one and no side has the right to infringe on the sovereignty of the state by concluding security political or economic agreements
342673 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
342674 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
342675 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
342676 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
342677 the company demands we wear the uniform every day to tuck the end of the shirt into the trousers and fasten the second button on the shirt
342678 some companies even demand drivers wear ties i do not think it is a good idea because it is dangerous in late nights or early mornings bad guys will easily use it to tighten around our necks
342679 do not talk about anything that will harm a safe olympics or any countrys dignity
342680 positively persuade them protect the car from damage protect the safety of passengers contact the police or choose another way to drive
342681 this is really helpful for the image of beijing for instance i used to spit in public now i know that i should use a paper tissue to spit and put it into the trash can
342682 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
342683 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
342684 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
342685 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
342686 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
342687 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
342688 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
342689 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
342690 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
342691 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
342692 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
342693 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
342694 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
342695 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
342696 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
342697 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
342698 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt hit very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game
342699 health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits
342700 are we supposed to like this asshole hes funny but surely the whole book cant be about him

342702 okay maam thats 3 burgers 2 shakes and 2 fries
342703 mama how come that guy only gave us 2 french fries thats just not enough fries
342704 mom i dont need a rest i dont want a rest
342705 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
342706 this has not been a good homestand and weve got to bounce back
342707 to win games youve got to put everything together and we have not done that on this homestand
342708 i tell the players every day not to believe what people are writing and saying about them
342709 you cant let that kind of thing go to their heads i learned a long time ago that you dont live in the past and you dont live in the future
342710 i figure i should get 10 to 15 percent better this year just because of that experience
342711 it was totally different than giving up a draft pick
342712 we were trading to fill a specific need we needed to build up the interior of the defensive line and we found two players who were available
342713 you see it in the billboards you see it in the people out here watching us at practice you see it when you meet people they want you to win its part of the citys heritage that the browns be winners

342716 we hoopten op zon moeilijke loting voor fc twente was dat financieel jammer maar voor het nederlandse voetbal maakt het niet uit is het misschien zelfs beter de punten die je in de uefa cup haalt tellen net zo zwaar als in de champions league
342717 afgelopen jaar heeft psv veel punten gehaald maar voornamelijk na de winterstop in de uefa cup dat is scheef en zal ik aankaarten in de commissie van de eca europese club associatie waar ik deel van uitmaak
342718 you cant get down on yourself your teammates or anybody else for that matter im not going to be a selfish guy and say i wish i could be winning more my mindset is just to try to do my best to keep the team in the game and try to get wins
342719 if i didnt hit that double odalis would have stepped it up and probably giving up no hits

342749 it would seem that those three different findings would have nothing to do with each other but in fact all these describe things that have an association with heart disease or stroke
342750 the radiologists typically dont report that because its so called a non finding for breast cancer but it may be a significant finding for women who have early heart disease
342751 i think what theyre trying to do over here is focus on the stroke risk and the fact is there is some simple things that are out there that theyre glossing over that we should be paying more attention to these things
342752 it would seem that those three different findings would have nothing to do with each other but in fact all these describe things that have an association with heart disease or stroke

342780 water is fun but it can be just as dangerous as fire
342781 we announce advisories to people at the gate or we announce it over megaphone
342782 but its their decision to go in the water or not
342783 they typically extend from the shoreline through the surf zone and past the line of breaking waves
342784 what happens is the rip current takes them away from the shore so they start to panic and try to swim back to shore
342785 but what youre doing is swimming against the current you wont make any progress
342786 we use the flags every day but some people arent paying much attention to it
342787 its a warm day and they want to go in
342788 im well aware of the waves and try to pay attention to how far they might drag me out into the water
342789 natural instinct will tell you to swim against it but that will be a losing battle
342790 let the current take you out away from the shore
342791 it may take you a good disitance out past the breaking waves
342792 that will get you out of the rip current and to a confined area where the current will be weaker
342793 the water will be calmer and you can swim safely back to shore
342794 just standing on the beach its hard to see a rip current with your eyes

342852 our car insurance rates are climbing in concert with the number of crashes involving illegal aliens crime rates are on the rise in areas with growing concentrations of illegal immigrants how many american citizens have to become the victim of illegal immigrant crime before america says enough is enough how many legal residents have to die at the hands of illegal aliens before america decides to end illegal immigration for good

342910 i think it will be great thats more opportunity for people to go down to chicago
342911 i would think it would probably be a good idea if i left holland two hours later in the morning and returned two hours later in the evening that would be feasible
342912 i think it would be a good idea just because it would help with the price of gas
342913 i am going to formalize an exchange between the students in queretaro and the schools in holland

342920 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
342921 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
342922 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
342923 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability

342936 the comorbidity between epilepsy and migraine has been well known for a century yet it is still not fully understood the two disorders also share some risk factors symptoms and preventive drug therapy a series of clinical observations and scientific data support the hypothesis of alteration of cortical excitability as a possible mechanism underlying their pathology with both disorders characterized by transient paroxysmal neurological disturbance so far the numerous pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for neuronal hyperexcitability have only been studied in familial hemiplegic migraine fhm but they do suggest a link between migraine and epilepsy
342937 recent studies showed hyperexcitability of the occipital cortex in subjects affected by migraine with aura it has been shown that 1 hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms reduces excitability of visual cortex in normal subjects the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of low frequency 1 hz rtms on visual cortical excitability by measuring changes in phosphene threshold pt in subjects with migraine with aura
342938 if the tdcs treatment makes it through clinical trials migraine sufferers may end up with a treatment safe enough to use without a physician present and whose only side effect would be a slight tingling sensation

342945 by selling selected stations in these markets we can focus on the larger market stations many of which are showing growth

342950 he was eternally optimistic always saw the positive side and the potential

342953 the interchange with the missing ramps created a unique situation
342954 people from new york going to the airport can drive the entire distance on interstates but when they get here they have to drive through a business district
342955 motorists should allow extra time when traveling on the inbound parkway north
342956 would justify anonymity in virtually every jury trial whether or not it attracts media attention since almost all defendants have friends and enemies who might be inclined to influence jurors
342957 of course in a given case a risk of jury tampering or excessive media harassment may exist
342958 but we are satisfied that district judges are well positioned to address these risks on a case by case basis and in such cases to make particularized findings on the record
342959 all jurors shall be identified in court during the jury selection process by his her assigned juror number only a prospective juror shall no longer be identified by or identify himself or herself by name
342960 should create a precedent that makes it clear that in most circumstances the use of a truly anonymous jury will not be proper
342961 it amounts to impermissible micromanagement of procedures and decisions that are properly delegated to the discretion of district judges
342962 thoroughly examine this application in accordance with the letter of the law
342963 critical to the states ability to repair and rebuild the 311 mile roadway across northcentral pennsylvania
342964 an aging heavily traveled highway built in the mid 20th century it will be an expensive repair project over the next decade
342965 ironic that mr markosek is now calling for expedited approval of the i 80 tolls when the state took from december until late july to resubmit its application
342966 the turnpike commission and penndot waffled over this application for seven long months said peterson aide patrick creighton
342967 has been assured that the federal department of transportation will thoroughly examine this application there is no dollar amount or lobbyist that can make this incoherent tolling plan look legitimate washington operates by the letter of the law this isnt harrisburg
342968 forensic under fire are bad science and dueling experts corrupting criminal justice
342969 the inability of our 21st century judicial system to properly differentiate between valid research and junk science
342970 the csi effect has also caused jurors to expect crime lab results far beyond the capacity of forensic science
342971 have kept scientific crime detection from living up to its full potential
342972 the less the forensic scientist knows about the crime the better
342973 make the civil and criminal justice systems more scientific and more objective to make them more just
342974 we should be ashamed of ourselves for not doing this
342975 my belief based on my research is that forensic science has failed to live up to the promise

342977 im just so very puzzled as to what could have happened because they were such good pilots
342978 these guys honestly were the nicest two men you could ever meet and they were the most careful men you could ever meet
342979 there was no failure of the aircraft all pieces were there it was nothing more than a stall spin which happens in landing situations when the pilots attention is diverted
342980 this gentleman ended up letting the plane get too slow
342981 what happened here is a classic example of individuals who come to oshkosh
342982 theyre so interested in getting here that they have no experience in going into a high traffic volume area theres a natural amount of apprehension and fear
342983 it was always his dream to fly my husband was a good pilot in fact he has a plane of his own which is still housed at the hangar

343100 his promotions were not bringing in a lot of dough he was hard up on cash
343101 my charm is so contagious vaccines have been created for it
343102 he said i have to report to work then ill come back
343103 the cashier took it in good faith that since he was a police officer hed be back
343104 and there have been times that ive wanted steamed vegetables since ive been raw and i have no problem having them its not that i crave them i just enjoy them it may be once a week but even if i wanted them more often i would have no problem with that either and if i wanted anything else thatd be fine too
343105 you dont feel bad that youre not eating 100 raw
343106 but thats never been the goal for me the goal is to have a beautiful relationship with food and feel joy and i feel because i do thats why i been able to come this far without a struggle im healthy and happy food isnt my focus its my nourishment
343107 it is easier to change a mans religion than to change his diet
343108 i dont understand why asking people to eat a well balanced vegetarian diet is considered drastic while it is medically conservative to cut people open and put them on cholesterol lowering drugs for the rest of their lives
343109 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

343114 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
343115 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
343116 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
343117 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
343118 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
343119 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

343124 i love my son very much i enjoyed him and i miss him
343125 its been a long time getting to this point where we have closure
343126 when it first happened everyone assumed it was an act of terrorism and here it turns out to be a home grown guy doing it himself then they ruined steven hatfills reputation
343127 you ought not send anything if youre a relative or a friend because it gets boiled it gets radiated it gets sent out to illinois
343128 it goes through all kinds of rigamarole all of our mail is delayed it created a whole industry to check all of our mail
343129 we got to have the justice department and the fbi and others come and explain what happened why it happened what are they doing to see that it doesnt happen again
343130 theyve got to tell us any and everything they can tell us now that we cant put ivins on trial suicide does not erase the presumption of innocence it does seem to me that theyve got explaining to do
343131 i can tell you exactly were he was sitting and exactly what he said and everything because it kept reflashing in my mind
343132 not a day goes by where we dont think about it
343133 its going to be a long time before its not thought of every day a lot because we still have a lot of adjustments things that we need to do to get better
343134 every alternative technology whether electrical or insulation would be subject to the building code
343135 we handle those on a site by site basis whether it is retro fitting or new construction
343136 we have to make sure the system has the proper protection equipment
343137 we have to check it to make sure the system is compliant and safe for the public and for our workers
343138 for the month of april when i wasnt using the air conditioner or heater my electric bill was only 4 02
343139 this past month with running the air conditioner and the higher rates my bill was around 40
343140 i am upset that after all this time and after all the publicity that no one else has done it
343141 putting it in didnt cost me any more than buying my car
343142 to get a system to power a house around the clock would require the purchase of batteries to store the electricity which is not cost effective
343143 natural gas prices are very volatile right now which increases the price of electricity using solar power in any capacity lowers your electricity usage and that greatly impacts the cost of electricity
343144 and it allows you to keep power in the event that there is a power outage
343145 solar is clean it is renewable and there are no emissions of any kind
343146 less than a year ago i would say it would take a decade to recoup your investment
343147 now i say that within 5 years there will be a convergence between the price of solar and electric power
343148 the price of electricity is going up and the price of solar continues to go down
343149 quando compareci aos jogos em sydney e em atenas eu estava realmente ansiosa para fazer aquilo
343150 i threw a brick through a window a day without me
343151 would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
343152 the appraisal issue is a problem that will take a long time to straighten out
343153 rates have been at about the same levels for the past five years so theres no interest rate incentive to refinance your conventional mortgages
343154 people are always surprised by how quiet and private this little community can be
343155 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
343156 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
343157 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
343158 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
343159 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
343160 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
343161 we spent a month scraping the wax and other junk off them
343162 each year we would try to do a little more as we could afford it its not much really
343163 if youre strong in all four corners youre on a chair
343164 thats pretty stable in theory i can take away one of the corners maybe your credit score has some dings or you need a stated income loan but the other corners are still pretty solid so you have a tripod thats not as stable as a chair but it will still stand up if you take away another corner you have a ladder ladders dont work anymore
343165 the biggest error we see borrowers make is that they will file their application they will be prequalified theyll have picked out their home and theyll be all excited theyll go and buy furniture cars boats and they will ramp up their debt and since credit is often rerun before closing that additional debt now causes them not to qualify
343166 if you transfer a balance to a new zero interest card your fico score will drop because all of a sudden you have more credit
343167 if your rate isnt locked and rates go up your debt to income ratio will change
343168 right before closing every lender verifies that the borrower is still employed in the same position
343169 the couches pulled out into beds and we always had our awning lights on and we met so many great people
343170 im hoping that my kids form the same happy memories
343171 you get to sample local foods and culture and see local attractions and meet some of the friendliest people on earth
343172 if it hadnt been for the trailer we wouldnt have gone near as many places
343173 its one of those things where sometimes youre an injury away from really needing one of these kids
343174 you know what maybe during the season they dont play offense but a couple of injuries happen where now its an easy transition
343175 pretty soon well change it up some where well have some priority offense and some priority defense where you see some kids switching over and going from there but our starting offensive line in the first practice today theyre all playing defense its all with the scheme of understanding there might be a game where we need them to step in so well be prepared
343176 if we get to where weve got guys who are equal and can play on the other side of the ball obviously two platooning is great
343177 but my philosophy is that we have to have our best players on the field especially with the schedule we play i think were going to get to where up front we two platoon for sure and well probably have whats called a player and a half
343178 its a select handful of guys anywhere from three to five of them
343179 its more about at times having our best athletes on the field and in a tight game not have them stand beside you
343180 it something i always wanted to hear when i was here at massillon and guys would come back and talk to me its an honor to be in that kind of position to come back and talk to these kids and give them advice i told them if anybody ever needed anything to talk to me ask me any questions dont be hesitant to ask thats what i hope these kids and massillon understand that you have to give back to massillon and stay humble about it
343181 we had the great spring and that was coach dave cutcliffes first taste into our program i got the opportunity and ran with it i plan to keep running with it hopefully pad some stats catch some balls and score some touchdowns and all of that hopefully its a break out season if i get the chance
343182 as far as with the football in our hands its been 7 on 7s and passing drills just player run stuff since ncaa rules dont allow coaches to get out there and work with us yet
343183 i came from a long ways in north carolina and never thought about the hall of fame
343184 i played quarterback in high school i come back every year to meet people you read about and see on tv now im a part of that team a team you dont have to worry about getting cut traded or whether i retire and want to come back next year
343185 he was a great player and he had a nose for the ball he shouldve been here a long time ago
343186 its a special class for us redskins to have darrell and art and emmitt who also coached there with me its a special time for us its a reflection not only of the players the ownership and redskin fans but of the great franchise we had in washington i appreciate that
343187 i start with character both of our guys going in were great people first i think their character did a number of things it kept them playing a long time theyre the kind of people a coach wants to keep on a team
343188 one of the greater qualities of a coach is to relate to players
343189 emmitt can get on their level he can coach anybody
343190 i wish everybody can experience what all these players are going through right now
343191 he didnt say anything but he showed me a lot
343192 he showed me the way to practice even in an all star game thats whats exciting about being here youre around these great guys and they still have a passion for the game
343193 i enjoyed watching a lot of the offensive lineman when i was playing and gary is a guy we watched a lot
343194 i felt he was one of the best when i was playing i get excited when another lineman is inducted
343195 as a rookie at left tackle i saw tape of dean and said is he really that fast or is the tape in faster speed how can a guy that size be that fast and that strong sure enough he was that fast he was that strong
343196 i got to go against andre one on one a lot of times
343197 what made andre great was his tenacity and his desire to play football he was an inspiration to the rest of his teammates to see andre and see a lot guys that werent on super bowl champions but were yet still great players in their own right inducted its a great tribute to him its well deserved and about time
343198 i really havent even thought about it because i want it to be a surprise even to me
343199 i could see me going to get a box of chicken or something with some friends thats about it
343200 i thank god for giving me ability and skills to deal with each and every one of them
343201 what a true honor it is to be here today
343202 it means a lot when i was announced into the hall i told people it felt like i was in the twilight zone it wasnt real it still feels that way
343203 it was kind of a badge of honor to play hurt
343204 im going to try to enjoy this and not rush myself
343205 after saturday when im inducted im actually going to come back
343206 i think theres probably no wide receiver happier that were both in the hall of fame
343207 he became a real personal friend he and i had great battles over the years and i became a big fan of his
343208 its something thats truly special something that you cant buy your way into you cant be cut and you cant quit im there tomorrow to really thank everybody that helped me along the way
343209 i was real fortunate to play with some really really good football players i dont think we had the success continuously as we thought we would have but we dont get here unless we have great people around us
343210 the audience doesnt want to listen to a bunch of women talking about whatever it is women talk about
343211 i mean thats not how i see it thats how they see it
343212 oh hey look men and boys are totally watching sarah connor and ellen ripley like its no big deal theyre chicks instead of guys
343213 oh hey look those effects that arnolds so awesome men and boys saw this movie despite some chick in a lead role
343214 i mean thats not how i see it thats how they see it
343215 but i did it for you and dont make me hurt you you ungrateful wench
343216 well some women may be offended by this but heres another dose of reality
343217 the gendered aspect of violence only becomes visible when women kill
343218 oooh mac users are sooo much more liberal progressive than m atan worshippers
343219 you dont know whats wrong with your computer because ur a womn luser and so did other male commenters
343220 the audience is mostly males and wont buy sets with female characters
343221 ahll only vote fer the candidate who has to wash himself with a rag on a stick
343222 which candidate would you rather eat 4lbs of taco bell followed by a dozen jalapeno poppers before busting an artery
343223 which candidate would you rather eat 4lbs of taco bell followed by a dozen jalapeno poppers before busting an artery
343224 thanks for the note did you actually read the story
343225 my name is amy and i can destroy my journalistic reputation in its infancy look here i go
343226 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
343227 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
343228 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
343229 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
343230 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
343231 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
343232 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
343233 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
343234 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
343235 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
343236 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
343237 the network operates on many levels to orchestrate the outcome of the debates it seeks to win and policies it is determined to impose
343238 the network operates on many levels to orchestrate the outcome of the debates it seeks to win and policies it is determined to impose one of the keys to this is to have establishment figures leading the opposition to your establishment agenda and thus control the outcome even if they dont even realise themselves that this is the case in sharmi chakrabarti the head of of the civil rights organisation liberty they have just such an establishment figure a former government barrister governor and member of round table groups like the ditchley foundation who interacts through many forums with the very people who want anything but liberty for the people of britain and the wider world i dont claim for a moment that she knows what is going on or how she is being used to limit the scale of the big brother debate and i dont doubt that she is against surveillance cameras and the denial of many civil liberties i am equally sure that she would never see herself as an establishment figure but from where i am sitting thats exactly what she is and if the british people leave the protection of their civil liberties to her and her organisation they are going to be deeply disappointed it is the same with official civil liberties organisations in the united states and elsewhere because they wont touch the wider conspiracy either the shami chakrabarti of the united states is nadine strossen a law professor who became the youngest and first woman president of the american civil liberties union aclu in 1991 professor strossen is a member of the council on foreign relations and replaced the previous aclu president norman dorsen a member of the council on foreign relations the same web turns up everywhere across the whole spectrum of what is called public life and what i am describing here is just one tiny expression of its reach and influence most people involved with these organisations dont even know how they are being influenced or kept under observation by the round table think tanks its time they did
343239 participating in a heavily secured carefully orchestrated sight seeing visit to iraq does not make you a military expert any more than a trip to yankee stadium qualifies one to be a baseball broadcaster for espn
343240 it looks like mickey mouse it sounds like mickey mouse but do you think mickey mouse would ever tell kids to fight americans and the jews
343241 we chose to dedicate to it to someone this year because shannons mother is involved and because it puts more of a face to the issue
343242 domestic violence is a senseless horrific crime that can be prevented
343243 shannon was only 24 years old a law student with her whole life in front of her she was always the first to try and help others we cannot help her now but we can help prevent the deaths of other potential victims
343244 she will converse with anyone has a large vocabulary uses big words and speaks with a british accent
343245 reigh has a distinctive walk and usually hops every five to six paces
343246 her favorite color is pink and she loves the book and the movie the little princess
343247 most of us were shocked to learn she was alive
343248 wherever he is now hes probably telling people that his wife died
343249 shes had a number of indiscretions over the years and been able to remain popular in her district
343250 this agreement should ensure that senator wilkerson and her campaign committee are and will be accountable in the future
343251 my committee has worked to install several new practices and policies to ensure that these types of accounting errors will not be repeated i am focused right now on representing my constituents by completing the important business of my district as we wind down the formal session and in short order i will return to the district to begin campaigning full time
343252 were concerned about the fact weve seen west nile virus earlier this year than previous years in mosquitoes
343253 we attribute that to the heavy rains we had in the spring and early summer
343254 the west nile virus was first introduced into america in 1999 so were only talking about nine years that its been in our area
343255 that is not enough time for us to really fully see the annual cycle this virus takes on
343256 the mother was always working and he essentially raised the child but the father was a control freak
343257 ultimately he refused to say who he really was so she got custody
343258 were looking for a way to put positive energy into the word
343259 you wind up with the straw that breaks the camels back
343260 i cant say when critical mass was reached but a number of us started posting that wed like to put moonbat on a t shirt and use it
343261 the moonbat militia is mobilizing just like the time stop n shop wanted to open that pharmacy on mass ave that would have brought light pollution to arlington center
343262 its the idea that moonbat can be as positive as yankee
343263 wouldnt it be great if we could get a photo taken with howie carr with the shirt on
343264 at the end of the movie bolt realizes that he can be a hero without superpowers so we wanted to honor real life heroes
343265 the dogs average eight to 10 years on the job
343266 when we retire them they remain with the handlers as pets
343267 the 199 price point is where demand leaps at amp t ceo randall stephenson says of apple iphones base model subsidized price
343268 that demographic isnt actually a demographic its mainstream america so long as the iphone had a hefty price tag stephenson says he and jobs feared it would never become a mass market item with a price of less than 200 however they thought the iphone could finally jump into the mainstream it seemed like an opportunity to change the game he says
343269 at amp t also gets some serious lift as with the original iphone 3g customers must sign a two year wireless contract existing at amp t customers have to re up for two years
343270 in exchange for its payout at amp t got a year extension into 2010 on its exclusive distribution deal with apple people familiar with the matter say sources asked to not be named because the terms are confidential
343271 at amp t stated in a july 1 2008 press release
343272 the fans really cared for manny so now were both depressed and relieved
343273 were depressed that hes gone but relieved for the team he wanted to leave and joe torre seems to love him were gonna be down for awhile but on the same token this had to happen
343274 became a major distraction for the team and it was time for him to go
343275 dominicans shouldnt say anything bad about manny because hes dominican
343276 when our kids leave they leave but they still stay our kids
343277 almost every year this was a pattern he started out as if he wanted to be in boston but come july and august he wanted to leave fans are 50 50 on the issue they realized the impact hes had on boston baseball but because of the actions hes taken lately especially in the last month or so it was time for somewhat of an amicable divorce

343305 the reason we did that was not to have an annual ball but having said that when we actually had the ball we realized people were very taken by the idea of having a veterans ball
343306 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it
343307 a lot of people enjoyed it and the board decided to make it an annual event
343308 were hoping to make the event a bit bigger this year

343317 one night i was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door and i heard the deacons voice exclaiming arise abraham the day of judgment has come i sprang from my bed and rushed to the window and saw the stars falling in great showers
343318 but looking back of them in the heavens i saw all the grand old constellations with which i was so well acquainted fixed and true in their places gentlemen the world did not come to an end then nor will the union now
343319 and this video wasnt explained very well in the title but i remembered that id seen this exact same clip somewhere else

343545 hope you dont mind me sending a letter one of the magazines you gave me had your address and there is still something about pen amp ink that email can never replace even for such a computer geek as i perhaps a bit more thoughtful contemplation and its been a while since i was inspired to write a letter tennyson im pleasantly amazed where i found myself seated and would have to concur with you that there can even be purpose in last minute standby seating arrangements i was a little taken back by your honest passion for god and clear insight into the heart of man both are rare to find in one person in retrospect even i was surprised with the ease of our open conversation for my part you speak with such natural authority im sure most cant help but listen i believe several events over the past few months were a precursor in our conversation preparing my heart to listen and be open to your words it was like a mirror talking to myself 10 years ago you really meet people where they are at in this life making one feel safe in expressing their opinions philosophy of life and god or lack thereof without judgment or dogmatism it was refreshing to discuss without the underlying defensiveness that can cause such discussion to get heated and go array it left me wanting with so many valid questions ideas perceptions yet to discuss to bounce off your fervent mind for god most importantly at least for me im thankful for your heart the passion for what you believe it is a bit ironic that after so many years of losing myself in the design of my own labyrinth god still seeks me out i should probably not be so surprised but i am we do fear what is hidden what is out of our reach control seeking to dissolve in our own mind numbing chaos too busy to discern or too contemplative of me where there is no room for god but myself there is the part of me that wonders why im telling you all of this and my only response is that i think you understand my questioning and a thankfulness for your interest concern for my spiritual welfare i simply enjoyed our conversation and your openness as well from our discussion youve inspired my mind to begin exploring more closely the roots of my fear if i even attempted to document my thought on the matter a dissertation might ensue but in short its clear that there is nothing that is safe secure or reliable enough to counter balance our fears except the veracity of gods love for his creation thats quite a concept to ponder its true i understand with my mind that if i allow him to mollify my fears empting myself and open my heart to be enraptured by his spirit the peace would be un surpassing yet my heart still needs to trust entrust a god who can harden hearts as well as open them with mine yes i still struggle over that theological concept thus fear the ability to trust still exists and affects even those of us who seek to conquer it daily however i am still in awe of how god works through you with gentle strength you embody genuine concern for humanity and youve been given rare gifts to encourage and challenge the hearts of men to consider a creator who can replace their fear with love by very creative intelligent means its very cool i know you hardly know me however if god is the god he says he is and if i in turn could encourage you id say to continue refining your hearts desire to pursue living without fear to ask him to make your fear clearly visible extinguish the deception it offers and replace it with the passion hes created within you for his peace understanding and love i know his will to bless you in all things preside over your fear and that his grace will be ever present for those you minister to again grateful to have met you and for both your encouragement amp prayer even on a plane as you could clearly see i am honestly fearful of my heart truly becoming sensitive to the things of god again and what that will change in my life even though i know im just spinning my wheels without him giving up that control and trusting something outside myself is currently my greatest struggle per our discussion your prayers are always welcome a sincere thanks for your listening heart and i look forward to a day that we might speak again mollybeth

343547 was done with the cooperation of elements on the left
343548 from a historical perspective eta is very weak at an organisational level it is nothing compared with what it was 10 or 15 years ago

343551 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
343552 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
343553 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
343554 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
343555 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
343556 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
343557 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
343558 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
343559 my life is filled with mundane things that i do not want to write about it i wish my life is like a movie and i am the screenplay writer i get to frame the most significant events of my life and edit out the boring rituals that fill my life unfortunately life is not like a movie
343560 i am glad that im writing again blogging is one of my ways to express myself and release excess thoughts made from my endless pondering
343561 i used to blog fearlessly but due to the current events of my life i have been so cautious with my blog posts
343562 now this is where i want you to catch your winning touchdown
343563 we are here to try and do something for those who are most overwhelmed with grief
343564 havent accepted it yet i didnt think anything like this was going to happen
343565 its just a sad shocking horrible event that i dont think any of us ever think will happen everybody is crushed sad hurt for the family and the kids who were there it was a pretty traumatic tragic thing for them to have to go through
343566 i think its going to help a little bit it wont help us get over it but maybe being together will help a little
343567 i dont think were quite at the anger stage kids people will process grief in a lot of different ways i think people are pretty numb theres still a great deal of shock being felt right now

343606 how to start a web directory to make money on the internet part 1
343607 but seriously bella ive been around hundereds of years and i bet that by the end of these next 4 years someone will realize im a vampire and stab me in the heart with a wooden steak
343608 at that moment bella knew it was best for the both of them if edward wasnt going to turn her into a vampire and if his life was going to just get more dangerous it was the best decision with that she took a wooden stake and put her love to rest
343609 you will ensure that those who care for you be it family members or complete strangers can do so in the way you feel is appropriate for you even if you are unable to communicate your wishes
343610 ill simply cross that bridge when i come to it
343611 if i were unable to communicate tomorrow who would know me well enough to care for me the way i would care for myself
343612 you can give your caregivers a manual on how to care for you if you are unable to remember or communicate important details about your life you can still share those details in your own words family members out of love may tell caregivers how
343613 quer a ser el maldini del psg pero no va a ser posible
343614 we plan for so many things in our lives holidays weddings careers families retirement travel and financial security yet we do not plan for our future healthcare or for life after illness or injury
343615 the holidays are the best time to initiate a future healthcare plan discussion because everyone is together the mood is light and families are naturally reminiscing about the past and thinking about the future
343616 ten minutes before sitting down to open presents or just as mom begins to carve the holiday turkey with a twelve inch electric knife may not be the best time to approach the subject
343617 plan your conversation well after the holiday dinner the opening of presents or the football game but before anyone heads home
343618 when families are aware of a loved ones wishes it helps but it is not enough to keep difficult healthcare decisions out of the legal system and out of the media spotlight as we saw with terri schiavo
343619 75 of americans fail to have a written plan or advance directive for future healthcare and medical treatment and virtually none have a plan for how they would like to be cared for by another person yet 3 out of 5 people will depend on someone else to provide care during their lifetime due to age illness or injury
343620 the better your caregivers know and understand you the better equipped they will be to give you quality compassionate and loving care
343621 information is being circulated at walter reed army medical center
343622 has seen no evidence that plastic containers or films contain dioxins and knows of no reason why they would

343627 do not mess with texas or any other 46 states or you will face a serious staffing problem its the kind of stern warning that will make a terrorist think twice before starting any kind of unpleasantness we all know how hard it is to find good help
343628 sure i could acquire a dirty bomb and strike out against the great satan but then id have to spend weeks looking for a new driver interviewing applicants blah blah blah then another two months training them even after all that it would take months or even years to get to know the new guy ugh its just not worth it lets get some frozen yogurt
343629 congress has the opportunity and the responsibility to increase college affordability
343630 a true master of the blade knows when he should fight he does not foolishly rush to the cries of war only to be beaten
343631 you must advance your ranking brother if we are to stay together in this place
343632 you above all should know that i am doing all that i can
343633 such excuses are not tolerated in our house and you know that
343634 then tell me sister whom should i challenge to gain more honor
343635 the twilek acehy her skills are quite impressive but she is a mindless beast your tactical skills are of no match simply out think her
343636 we have already lost one student should we risk the death of a second for a vendetta
343637 we are here to learn about the living force not to fight amongst ourselves
343638 she killed him it was brutal she almost knocked his head off of his shoulders with a blunt weapon terrianth has the right to claim revenge
343639 do you really think that the chiss would win her own rage has blinded her she cannot draw on the power of her anger in that state of mind
343640 anyone who does not see what that being has done as murder does not belong here even if the masters will not act we have not only a right but a responsibility to the force to cleanse this academy of those who would do harm to it
343641 she has killed again it isnt safe to let her stay here
343642 look the door was blown in she was attacked and defended herself let her be
343643 this is not what we were brought here to do we were not trained in the ways of the force to use it against each other put away your weapons the security holograms will tell the truth of what happened
343644 first you murder my brother now youve killed another student how many more must die before the masters remove you from this academy i say we take matters into our own hands and remove her ourselves
343645 it will end up costing more than you can possibly know
343646 if she is the one responsible for this why then did she set off an explosion at her own door
343647 we have lost enough students on her account jakin get rid of her or we will
343648 master nemath first you tell me that acehy is a killer and now are you challenging me
343649 if you are not willing to do what is best for this academy then you should be removed
343650 yes master he attacked me along side of the little one over there
343651 he was part of my clan i am honor bound to avenge him acehy smome i know that you acted in self defense but i have no choice defend yourself
343652 youve learned much in your short time here but it isnt enough to defeat me your fate is sealed i have seen it
343653 acehy i have finally found you i am rain your sister
343654 you are my sister i can see it in your mind you were taken from our parents when i was just an infant just as i was taken from them only a few years later
343655 yes sister it is just how you say it is the jedi who brought me to the order sensed great potential in me even though i was far older than any of the other initiates i almost was not trained since i left the jedi order i have searched for you after you killed the men i sent to collect you on roxuli i lost you
343656 you sent that swoop gang after me i thought they were trying to kill me and my escort
343657 i regret that i was not able to be there myself you see i was still trying to catch up to you after you left coruscant with the outbound flight project i was only able to contact some beings that owed me a favor
343658 their leader was most angry with me when he learned that you had killed his men
343659 master jakin this is my sister rain she has been looking for me and has finally found me
343660 indeed she seems to have found you what then sister rain are your intentions here
343661 i am here to take acehy back to the core and i will complete her training
343662 you would train her as a sith your code is out dated and pointless
343663 i will not be drawn into a debate with you about what is the true path of the force
343664 shall we go sister or do you wish to see the death of others here
343665 no im not sure any survive who i would see dead
343666 what a piece of junk does the force hold it together
343667 this is the deamons claw make it your home until we get to where we are going
343668 i am taking you to see the dark jedi order there you will either learn as i have or die
343669 i am a lady of the sith but the sith are something far different than you have ever been taught about either from the jedi or that fool back there
343670 teach me sister and i shall learn all there is to know
343671 very good sister now all you need to do is survive your introduction
343672 did you really think that you were the only other being sensitive to the force
343673 are you just one of the instructors or are you the only one
343674 i am the headmaster of this academy and yes you will be learning both under me and several other masters
343675 the planet it seems to mimic the philosophy of duality
343676 indeed my theory is that the planets appearance is what drew revan to it originally this whole system is comprised of planets strong in the force yet none are inhabited nor do they seem to ever have been inhabited this is strange indeed stranger still is that neither the light side of the force nor the dark side of the force seems to be stronger than the other
343677 it is unknown why revan came here but none the less he did and he set up this training academy it would seem that originally it housed thousands of students there are more living quarters than we have students at this time but eventually that will change
343678 you have been chosen from the depths of the universe who you were before you entered this academy has no meaning no value do not think that any training you received from any other master besides those here has any merit now kneel before the disciples of revan
343679 we are the disciples of revan we hold allegiance to the living force there is no darkness there is no light we are the shadows the gray the force is life
343680 this is kaleeb he will show you to your quarters and teach you how to access your data terminal
343681 my name is master heiradoth it is pronounced hair ah do tah you will regret any mispronunciation
343682 learn from both neither are truly correct in their thinking in their dogma but if you can learn to use the strengths from both and avoid the weaknesses of either you will be unstoppable
343683 your lightsaber is more than just a weapon it is a symbol of your duality both the light side and the dark side of the force flow through you the crimson blade is the representation of the dark side and the cobalt blade the purest color and representation of the light side of the force neither is more powerful than the other but when both are used properly and in unison none can stand against you
343684 her blade i was unprepared for it to change like that
343685 your level of preparedness has nothing to do with it you stopped listening to the force the force will guide you if you listen to it
343686 master heiradoth tells me that youve grown significantly in your skills with a blade
343687 however she also tells me that though you have been challenged several times now but you have yet to challenge anyone yourself why is that
343688 when none are left who will challenge me then i know who i must challenge until then let the weak come against me and prove their weakness
343689 you are wise to think that those who challenge you are looking to improve their status you are about to begin the next phase of your training you will be taught some of the deeper areas of the force you have already learned about running while using the force though highly useful it is mere childs play in comparison you will be taught how to heal the body of yourself or another how to use aggressive talents and passive talents
343690 now focus where is the pain the strongest envision the pain now use the force push it out of your body
343691 ah you see young one you can do it while not all injuries are as easy to heal as that one the principle is the same
343692 im sorry to hear that youve called off the search captain
343693 if you know some jedi trick to find her i suggest you start using it because as far as my men and resources are concerned they are exhausted face it the waste land has claimed your padawan there is nothing that can be done for her now
343694 i dont agree with you but i must defer to your superior knowledge of this planet i shall return to coruscant and report of her merging with the force farewell captain
343695 for what its worth im sorry we need all the jedi that we can get right now
343696 you worm head youre going to give me your respirator and your food tonight or there is going to be a little accident in this here tunnel
343697 what it takes three of your to force me to do something
343698 whoa looks like you dont know your own strength youd better be careful when you try to take things away from little girls like me you might hurt yourself
343699 they came for the steel companies and nobody said anything they came for the auto companies and nobody said anything they came for the office companies people who did white collar service jobs and no one said anything and they came for the professional jobs that could be outsourced and nobody said anything
343700 early on the kahnawake peacekeepers called in the assistance of the s ret du qu becs accident reconstruction unit to help them with their investigation
343701 all the boys and girls in our neighbourhood who know this little boy are being affected the mothers parents everyone is being affected these are our children that are walking on the streets
343702 the local police know where people live and they wouldnt be as reckless and endanger the local children so why would the officers of police who dont know the neighbourhood have any business on the reserve
343703 5 continuous hours of energy without the crash at the end

343708 oh my god becky look at her butt its just so huge i bet shes one of those rappers girlfriends
343709 we believe the terms of this agreement will provide strong protection to our brand worldwide
343710 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
343711 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
343712 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
343713 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
343714 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
343715 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
343716 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
343717 sold juelzs contract to parent label def jam for 2 million
343718 but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter
343719 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
343720 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
343721 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
343722 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
343723 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
343724 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
343725 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
343726 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
343727 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
343728 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
343729 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
343730 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
343731 with the vote 8 to 0 jessie who looks up in surprise the votes to evict angie
343732 mother father god and holy spirit assist me by disconnecting all energy connections from me to others and from others to me
343733 i now am willing to connect with my divine source of energy and i allow only the highest vibration of love to connect me to others and others to me
343734 they arent going to miss you for five minutes now are they
343735 i felt you long before you landed i felt you i felt your rage as you killed the guards while still on the transport i felt your elation as you let their bodies slump to the deck plates i felt your power you are strong in the force indeed
343736 my name is jakin and to answer your next question i am no sith they are idealistic fools who stick to a code just like the jedi their grasp of the force is limited by this code you will come to learn this as i have in due time
343737 you have a choice become my apprentice until the time where you can kill me or until i deem you worthy of being unleashed upon the universe or you can die where you sit for the simple crime of being too weak to accept your destiny
343738 indeed the force shows me a great many things about you i have waited here for you for more than three years of this planets years you were once a jedi padawan and your master died in his sleep of old age are not these things true
343739 when the moons of this world align they act like a focal point for the force more than three millennia ago there were force sensitive civilizations on all three moons all three were in a constant state of war between each other for more than a thousand years they fought none could gain a true advantage over any of the others then a creature came from within the rim it consumed the force within all the beings and left a hole when those holes align the force pours through them and when that happens those who know where to be can absorb the raw force power as i meditated during the last alignment three years ago i saw you and the events of your life in a vision i knew that all i had to do was wait and you would eventually come to me so that is how i came to find you acehy smome now what do you say will you learn from me or die
343740 i have my own goals and ambitions dieing here and now would not get them accomplished i will learn from you until i am able to kill you or you deem me worthy to be unleashed upon this universe
343741 i have a place where i will conduct the majority of your training it is on a distant planet even farther beyond the rim than we are now in fact it was once the home of one of the most powerful dark lords of the sith and one of the greatest jedi of his time yes it was the same person a human male who had an affinity for both sides of the force who was originally trained as a jedi but fell to the ways of the sith and returned to the jedi after like all sith he was betrayed by his apprentice his mind was destroyed and the jedi who found him repaired it
343742 have you ever been told of the duality of a jedi known as revan
343743 revan was a jedi knight during the time of the mandalorian war against the republic during that time the jedi high counsel thought it best to stay out of the conflict until the reason for the mandalorian attack became understood revan however disagreed with the counsel and against their wishes went to fight in the great war many jedi followed revan first there was malak his closest friend others followed revans campaign against the mandalorians was credited with many successes in fact the republic was on the verge of loosing the war before revan and his jedi stepped in revan defeated the mandalorians and single handedly killed their leader malachor the ultimate in the last battle of malachor v instead of returning a hero revan returned with a fleet bent on conquering the republic and with a new mantle darth revan dark lord of the sith the jedi civil war had begun darth revan had amassed a fleet out of what seemed to be thin air in truth he had found a massive battle station that also was a ship yard it was called the star forge the jedi seemed to give ground at every encounter until the emergence of bastila shan and her rare gift of battle meditation battle meditation allowed her to anticipate the enemys battle plan inspire her own forces and cripple the morale of the enemys forces where ever she was there was victory for the republic the jedi counsel decided to use her in a most impressive manner quite unlike the jedi indeed she and strike team of jedi were sent to capture revan during a massive battle she was able to get her strike team aboard the sith flagship and made it to the bridge to confront the dark lord at that time his apprentice the now darth malak chose to usurp his masters title and ordered his own ship to attack revans the dark lord was knocked unconscious and due to his injuries slipped into a deep coma bastila used what healing techniques she knew to keep revan alive however in doing this she formed a force bond between them the jedi chose this time to act using the force the stripped him of his memories and reprogrammed his mind with another with revan now converted and again an ally to the republic the jedi sat back and let the force resurface in him with the assistance of bastila and several others revan was able to defeat his former apprentice and destroy the star forge and seemingly once and for all end the sith threat only something was wrong revan sensed something that no other jedi sensed he abandoned his companions leaving instructions behind and left to go beyond the outer rim where revan ended up only i know only i have found it
343744 you still havent bought any syrup how am i supposed to eat waffles with no syrup
343745 when im called off i got a sawed off squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
343746 we would like to assess the state of human rights in malaysia with the ngos and prepare a report
343747 we want to urge him to try to meet and discuss freely with the win tin and the 88 generation students group including min ko naing it is also necessary to ask for their release
343748 we will hope that the special rapporteur can persuade the government of myanmar to release all prisoners of conscience immediately
343749 the special rapporteur wishes to engage in a constructive dialogue with the authorities with a view to improving the human rights situation of the people of myanmar
343750 i started to understand the complexities of balancing intricate interests with legal clarity started to imagine the impact of the law on people not from the point of view of the lawyers arguing the case but from the point of view of the person in the street asking whether a law was just or unjust sensible or foolish wise or ignorant
343751 it must be remembered that judges simply do not bear direct responsibility if as a result of their decisions governments cannot for example stop a terrorist attack
343752 it is right that they can that they are above me and not me above them
343753 at the moment there are negotiations between arshavin and tottenham however because of the big transfer sum zenit are asked for it is taking some time
343754 tottenham boss juande ramos wants to sign arshavin and has made him his main transfer target chairman daniel levy is also doing his utmost to make sure the transfer goes through but it is proving difficult to reach an agreement with zenit
343755 ramos has been following arshavin for a long time even when he was coach of sevilla
343756 andrei has already expressed his desire to move on from zenit and has also said that he wants to play for tottenham he likes the teams style of play and ramos style of management
343757 ramos has phoned the player directly and in that conversation he spoke of his vision for the club and the role arshavin will play in that
343758 my only wish is to play with a stronger team if zenit agrees with chelsea or arsenal i will gladly join either of them
343759 at the moment he van der vaart is not here yet but hes a great player hes a great signing for madrid
343760 i remember when i was at chelsea and madrid wanted me
343761 its a difficult situation and you suffer i was training every day with chelsea but my head was in madrid and as the signing wasnt definite i had a bad time of it
343762 i advise van der vaart to be calm train with hamburg and keep himself in shape
343763 i think so why not this madrid side is a very good team with great players in different positions
343764 last year we played really well in the league and for that reason we won it this year we have to win the champions league
343765 i think its more important for us to keep players than to sign them
343766 real madrid are looking for a replacement and its fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
343767 its very difficult for me to speak about this because people have been talking about cristiano ronaldo for months
343768 everyone knows that cristiano is one of the best players in the world hes very good thats for sure
343769 lara is definitely not pregnant and we have no stories placed with new idea a spokeswoman from international quarterback said
343770 shes only 20 and theyre not even married yet view rss feed
343771 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
343772 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
343773 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
343774 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
343775 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player we can squash that one
343776 dreams are dreams i aint gonna play the fool anymore

343781 lt parko was supposed to be back with that padawan more than a three standard hours ago
343782 sir lt parko has not checked in at either the north gate or the west gate
343783 give lt parko half a standard hour then start sending out search parties for him the transport from coruscant will be here in the morning and we must find them
343784 weve found lt parko he is dead sir and the jedi padawan is missing
343785 i dont care what you need to do sergeant find that jedi keep me informed with hourly updates errin out
343786 i dont understand it this should have been a simple escort mission now one of my officers is dead and your padawan has gone missing
343787 the force guides us all captain i have faith that we will soon find out what happened to our wayward youngling
343788 still no word on the location of our missing padawan captain
343789 the force has a way of guiding those who listen to it in time she will be found
343790 time is one thing we do not have few live more than a day or two out in wilds of this dead planet
343791 do not underestimate even the youngest of padawans they are capable of doing more than most fully trained survival experts
343792 new zealand first wants to see a tax free threshold of 5 200 introduced
343793 new zealand first also wants to see gst reduced to 10 across the board
343794 so in contrast to the other parties we offer a tax policy that is clear easily understood practical and delivers immediate benefits in terms of extra income and a lower cost of living
343795 but we also have a fundamental difference with labour and national on where tax cuts fit in terms of an overall economic policy
343796 in fact we ask why should tax an important but in reality an open and shut issue be allowed to dominate the economic agenda in truth focusing on tax cuts is a convenient way of drawing peoples attention away from the deeper and more fundamental challenges facing the economy that neither labour nor national actually want to address
343797 so our message to new zealanders is straightforward certainly let us have tax cuts but let us not pretend that tax cuts are the magic bullet the panacea that will transform our economy our message to new zealanders is this look beyond tax cuts look for what it is going to take to radically improve our economic prospects as a country look at which party is offering a long term economic strategy to take new zealand into the future
343798 first and foremost among the areas that need to be addressed is the role of the reserve bank as a matter of urgency we must rewrite the reserve bank act now this is an obscure piece of legislation that very few new zealanders understand and even fewer have actually read
343799 the job of the reserve bank should be to maintain stability in the economy in terms of employment and growth as well as keeping inflation under control as it is for example in the uk and the us
343800 the new zealand based economic think tank berl which actually works on new zealand based solutions not imported ones has tackled this matter and written an extremely good paper on it they have arrived at the same conclusions as new zealand first that the reserve bank act needs to be rewritten
343801 in fact mark weldon the head of the new zealand stock exchange has also expressed this view publicly so we have been joined by some pretty sound economic minds on this matter
343802 the berl research offered four steps in rewriting the reserve bank act which we want to raise tonight
343803 extremely well thought out and most importantly new zealand driven ideas
343804 if export growth and addressing our outrageously large balance of payments deficit was a priority then the reserve bank would behave differently you see there really is an alternative one which can be built around what is best for all new zealanders in the 2008 election campaign new zealand first will be saying to new zealanders do not be deceived
343805 when you look at the tax packages on offer you will find new zealand first has the edge
343806 but look further look at who is facing up to the deeper economic issues facing new zealand and who is offering new thinking about the economy because in the area of economic policy the time is ripe for bold and innovative thinking and that is what we intend to bring to the 2008 election today we have set out a number of policy steps that we see as priorities if we are to ensure new zealands future prosperity all of these steps are practical and achievable
343807 mamn what were you doing at the wakonda country club
343808 i was attempting to make a citizens arrest of karl rove your honor
343809 the olympics have become inseparable from politics countries have used their status as olympic hosts to secure international prestige and legitimacy often for ill the most notorious example was the 1936 berlin games they were a coming out party for the third reich which had already launched its war against its own jewish population the united states not only ignored calls for a boycott of the games to our eternal disgrace we bowed to nazi pressure and replaced two jewish sprinters marty glickman and sam stoller with more acceptable gentiles while those games are best remembered for jesse owens one man demolition of nazi racial theories his triumph was sadly an individual not a national one now it is chinas turn like nazi germany china craves the respect and prestige that goes with hosting the games
343810 why the chinese regime wanted the worlds greatest sports festival is clear it hasnt spent more than 40 billion on these games and showpiece facilities just so we can all watch some athletes running around it instead plans to use this gigantic television stage to announce to the world the dawn of the new china century and to awe its subjects with the glory won by their unelected leaders who have finally given their country a place in the sun but why the ioc handed over the games to this celebration of totalitarian rule and this resentful demand for status is less clear
343811 sure the ioc is now wallowing in chinese cash but to name beijing as host city ran counter to the ioc charter which insists the goal of the games is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity er so thats why the ioc weasels gave it to china a country with no free speech no rule of law no free elections and a habit of sponsoring tyrants in places such as zimbabwe sudan and burma
343812 the olympics is intended to be a celebration of the human spirit but the spirit of the chinese people not to mention the spirit of the tibetans and other minorities is being crushed under the weight of an oppressive regime we should no more celebrate the olympics in china in 2008 than we should have celebrated the olympics in nazi controlled berlin in 1936
343813 china is one of the worst violators of human rights in the world given the chinese communist party bragging rights over the games makes a mockery of their meaning
343814 we christians cannot permit the world to turn a blind eye to the persecution endured by chinese christians the rutherford institute claims that 50 to 100 million members of the house church movement are coming under increasing pressure as the olympics approach two incidents should be enough to paint a chilling picture in april 2007 according to john whitehead one chinese christian liu huiwen was arrested for distributing christian literature to muslims in the gansu province huiwen was reportedly severely beaten and sentenced to 18 months in prison
343815 for printing christian literature pastor cai zhuohua was tortured and imprisoned in a cold and cramped cell with 27 other prisoners and forced to make soccer balls for 10 12 hours a day for the olympic games these are not isolated instances but part of an overall effort to squelch the house church movement freedom house reports instances in which the buildings where unregistered congregations hold services have been demolished by the government
343816 when i was in the soviet union right after the fall of communism i met with many dissidents who told me how encouraged they were when reagan publicly repudiated the evil empire and about how they were mistreated whenever western diplomats legitimized the soviet regime
343817 all individuals and groups concerned about human rights whether their issue is the suppression of journalism the persecution of religious groups or forced abortion
343818 infertility can be a very difficult experience women should not have the added burden of fighting for health benefits they are entitled to receive
343819 it took a lot of courage for one woman to come forward with her experience but now others will benefit from her strength
343820 forty years after the 1967 abortion act women in northern ireland are still facing conditions more reminiscent of the 19th century all women in the uk must be given fair and rapid access to safe legal abortion when they need it
343821 i didnt want to be moved and basically id be punished in a sense
343822 women with a sleep duration of 6 hours or less 8 hours or 9 hours or more increased the risk of stroke by 14 percent 24 percent and 70 percent respectively compared with sleeping 7 hours
343823 our data does not imply that if women with long sleep cut their sleep hours they would be at a lower risk further studies are needed to help us understand the possible mechanisms involved in the associations found in this study
343824 failure to treat rape as seriously as other violent crimes
343825 terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
343826 her existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated
343827 we have always believed and worked hard to ensure that every woman has the best medically accurate information so that she can make the right decision for her unique circumstances
343828 this law is not about informed consent its about compelling doctors to deliver state mandated ideology
343829 aka spearheaded the first full time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights the national non partisan council on public affairs
343830 because of her respect for each of the historically black sororities and fraternities her membership is non exclusive she looks forward to working with all of them to help bring change to their communities

343836 there are indications that elements of the isi provided support to those believed responsible for carrying out the attack
343837 there are real questions about the organization s loyalty in the wake of political gridlock and a lack of a clear political direction some elements of the isi have started to exercise certain prerogatives
343838 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistan s neighbours then the government would certainly act on that evidence
343839 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
343840 if you ask me to describe the state of the india pakistan dialogue it is in a place where it hasn t been in the last four years
343841 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
343842 in general this administration at its upper reaches has been cool to the elected government from the start they like to look at musharraf as a factor for stability
343843 people tend to forget the frustrations that were there when musharraf was in place the civilians are a mess right now and the government is in a state of flux when there s flux individuals in the isi revert to form
343844 it is pointless to talk to the governor again unless he sends us a concrete proposal on the land issue
343845 ricky davis is now an la clipper finishing at last his 8 or 9 year journey to his true destiny
343846 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
343847 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
343848 but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
343849 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
343850 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
343851 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
343852 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
343853 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year

343855 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland

343857 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
343858 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
343859 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
343860 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
343861 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
343862 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
343863 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
343864 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
343865 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
343866 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
343867 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

343873 while some of the benefits have been passed to the final consumer the data suggests that wealthier households benefit more in absolute terms
343874 the focus needs to move away from rights based land reform
343875 the poorest people in south africa buy a large proportion of their food in the informal sector where vat is not an issue

343884 there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
343885 they have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events
343886 its clearly something we cant do anything about but the hotspot is more vulnerable than it used to be 6 or 10 million years ago
343887 its more vulnerable so you have to be extra cautious about what you do its closer to the edge than it was
343888 it just happens i dont go out there with a different mentality i just go in there to get three people out
343889 you cant go out there and walk the first guy
343890 thats unacceptable you cant go out there and walk anybody

343900 both obama and clark had the courage to oppose the iraq war from the start
343901 tony blair signed up to eu plans that signaled death across europe for traditional style bulbs earlier this year
343902 would not liberty be more valuable for your opinion there
343903 we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard
343904 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
343905 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
343906 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
343907 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
343908 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
343909 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
343910 the audience doesnt want to listen to a bunch of women talking about whatever it is women talk about

343922 i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier

343931 no man should be set on fire trying to save one of his shitters
343932 if people have a problem with what i do thats their problem not mine
343933 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
343934 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
343935 there was a dozen ideas proffered how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why don t we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes through the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you can t have americans killing americans but that s the kind of that s the level of stuff we are talking about provocation but that was rejected

344053 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
344054 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still quite constrained there are no clear signs its improving
344055 governments could back themselves into a corner if they create political pressure to cut variable rates
344056 if funding costs have not declined the rational response from a bank would be to cut back on lending which would mean a further contractionary effect for the economy

344118 this is a bittersweet moment for tobacco growers and their families
344119 todays announcement signals the beginning of the end of a way of life for generations of tobacco farm families
344120 theres a lot of people who feel the same way
344121 there was just way too much pressure on this community through no fault of our own and it needed to be lifted
344122 this is just about finding a way to move forward the uncertainty in this community has been the tough part over the years
344123 farming is a business but its also a proud way of life that goes back generations
344124 the crop will be smaller so i doubt theyll need the share growers

344134 we are like every other side that is in fourth to 12th or 13th were all under pressure because every game is so important sometimes you run into form sometimes you dont
344135 i think that some top sides can generally hold their own but we are clearly one of the middle ranked sides and you fluctuate accordingly and when you do that you appear slow you appear lacking confidence
344136 id say yes weve lacked confidence and yes when youre chasing you do look slow then it starts to affect other things the skill level we know what the skill level against hawthorn was like
344137 it will turn so long as the players believe and thats why every week you go in with some confidence
344138 because you just know at some stage you keep at it and you keep at it and the good people that are good players will turn it around at some stage for you

344169 im looking to not just win this title i want to win all the belts in this weight division
344170 theres only two other champions holding all the other belts at super flyweight and if one of us becomes the undisputed champion its very nice and that one is going to be me
344171 i dont want to just become undisputed champion i dont want to stay too long in this weight division i want to fight for other belts
344172 im 32 i want to move because i can feel big power
344173 i can fight any opponent larger than me and i feel powerful and every day the power is getting more and more
344174 im very focussed for the fight people are going to see a strong smart and focussed fighter
344175 i must stress that the nrl and not the clubs should look at paying on top of a players club contract a separate commercial contract for elite players
344176 an elite groups of say 30 players based on what that players is worth to the game commercially
344177 say the most a top end player can get from the nrl as a top up sum is 300 000 and the minimum is 100 000 then the average per player will be 200 000
344178 it would do a lot to stop high profile players leaving the nrl
344179 thirty players at an average of 200 000 would mean the nrl would have to find 6 million a season and would stand a much better chance of keeping its players
344180 i dont think 6 million is something the nrl given its turnover and its multi million dollar tv rights wouldnt be able to find in its next budget
344181 an elite contract would make it more attractive for those guys who people love to watch either live or on the box to stay in rugby league

344241 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
344242 its a shame that peoples awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles
344243 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks

344313 alpha males dont look at the world to determine their behavior or wait for social clues they take their frame of reference from inside they are authentic
344314 the approval or disapproval of others dont matter none of that changes how an alpha male views his decisions or actions
344315 an alpha male is a rock while a woman is an emotional rollercoaster
344316 dont be affected by what a woman says if you value yourself more than any woman it doesnt matter what she says or does
344317 dont determine how you feel by how other people react
344318 a real alpha male appreciates approval but doesnt need it he doesnt care what you think
344319 make yourself the center the world around you is just part of your reality
344320 become a master of recognizing self deception be honest with yourself all the time

344324 set your boundaries and be the person you want to be the alpha male controls his reality
344325 an alpha male is someone who makes others feel comfortable around him he operates from a position of strength
344326 dont be desperate to be respected respect yourself and be effective in what you do

344332 if gender based violence is everywhere so is the church
344333 the church is the hope of the world and gods plan for dealing with the problems of the world whether dealing with violence poverty orphans or aids if we dont start with the church we are starting at the wrong end of the equation
344334 where i live in the u s we tend to be quiet about it it is not socially acceptable we dont talk about it but just because it is hidden or quiet doesnt make it right from cambodia to rwanda to women in my own church it is everywhere
344335 we have to ask ourselves what can the church do
344336 there is only so much governments ngos and relief organizations can do we have to speak up for those who have no voice
344337 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
344338 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
344339 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
344340 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
344341 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
344342 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
344343 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
344344 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
344345 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
344346 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened
344347 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
344348 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
344349 i closed my eyes and i seen him in the window there just like a madman
344350 when you see something as horrifying as that the brain locks on to those images its very difficult to release those images
344351 the assistance that people will get will be along the lines of coping in the immediate phase learning what to do to reduce the profound effect this experience will have
344352 they will experience very very vivid flashbacks of that occurrence those will usually dissipate over a period of time but right now its going to be very vivid as theyre still dealing with the shock and processing this horrific event
344353 theres not a right or wrong way to go through this some people will still be in shock and being very flat in presentation like nothings happened other people may not get out of bed and not want to move for a while or be having what we call very acute responses so theyll be maybe crying and not wanting to calm down at all everybodys going to go through this very difficult journey in a very different way
344354 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
344355 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
344356 all we can do is physically observe the individuals behaviour but obviously the item of destruction got on the bus somehow and if it was visible to any driver he would not have boarded the bus just for that simple reason
344357 there has to be some reactive measures taken whether it be metal screening or whether we design differently our loading policies at various depots so you have to funnel down a chute as your only way onto the bus at major terminals i really believe now we have to do something not only that we have to be investigating carry on luggage and certain things like that
344358 we are working with transport canada to review inter city bus security
344359 you need more than an inch cut off i know you dont want to hear it

344362 you have to stop working yourself up either you trust in me in us or you dont and if you dont i can respect that but then you need to move on

344366 theyre even on perez hiltons who to watch list and nobody except you has ever even seen one of them
344367 has a man ever done anything for you before for you do you think he had your interests in mind
344368 i dont give a shit what his interest is these guys are sick creeps
344369 you were there you heard his all male ego shit
344370 i wish you would have killed the bastard that day in the library
344371 if you would have known then what kind of lowlife scum he truly is things would have been different now

344374 round voluptuous breasts dont interest me anymore give me a firm hard buttocks with a stick shift in front to control the speed and i can almost forget any bleach blond with swaying curvaceous hips and a moist warm peach

344377 the quality of the entire experience and the extent to which it is felt to be a difficult time depends entirely on how one has lived during the previous twenty nine years

344420 stimulate you to think about one central biblical concept the kingdom of god
344421 jesus meant when he called us to seek first his kingdom and what it really looks like to expand everything our lives contain to touch the size of his kingdom
344422 there is a desire for transcendence in all of us because god placed it there he constructed us to live for more than ourselves and furthermore we were never meant to be self focused little kings ruling minuscule little kingdoms with a population of one
344423 its right for you to care about your health your job your house your investments your family and your friends it would be irresponsible to act as if none of these things mattered yet it is a functional human tragedy to live

344426 it is told in the forest brakes it is told on the purple hills by the silent mountain lakes by the singing and leaping rills
344427 in the meadows that stretch away as a sea of golden green with hedges of sweet white may and the reedy brooks between
344428 where i wander and run and rest the tale is told to me the sweetest tale and the best of all the tales that be
344429 the tale is the tale of jesus it is told in heaven above on the sea and the moors and the mountains in language of all the peoples the speech of love
344430 the morning star and the dayspring the sun and the cloud and the shower the grass and the rose and the cedar his glory and love are telling from hour to hour
344431 the birds in the green wood singing the sea that is wide and deep the sheep in the folds of the mountains the corn in the golden valleys and all beside
344432 all round me are glorious pictures of him who has made them fair through the long bright day i can see him and i fear not the silent darkness for he is there
344433 new england primer famous american school book first published before 1690
344434 advertised as an easy and pleasant guide to the art of reading this new england primer is a facsimile reprint circa 1905 illustrated with black and white woodcuts the rhyming lessons were intended to teach moral values as well as reading schoolbooks were not provided by the schools at this time and parents were obligated to purchase books for their children from a list approved by their local district school committee
344435 the first settlers of new england brought primers with them from england where they had been in use for over a hundred years primers also known as catechisms began as devotional books containing simple instructions in christian knowledge such books typically contained an illustrated alphabet along with informative pictures and stories with a heavy dose of moralism this example includes both biblical e g zacheus and modern references washington even in this late edition the puritan preoccupation with death was impressed on young readers
344436 an hero to take that shot to leave us all behind

344440 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
344441 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
344442 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had
344443 how then can you soldier on business as usual knowing that something is wrong and keep a clear conscience if you do nothing
344444 by my life or by my death may christ be glorified
344445 peace negottions often fail because of poor communication and poor understanding ict can help provide better communications and understandings in terms of quality quantity and timeliness

344447 meetings like this workshop always focus on the cheapest tools that can be used at a certain point he went on the value equation has to be revised significant amounts of money even 5 million for a high bandwidth technology in a troubled portion of the world might cost much less even if measured only in dollars than a war which could cost billions
344448 there is an atrium a public atrium that people will be able to walk through and go to the shops down in the lower level
344449 so while 29 units may sound like a small number of residential units for a whole city block were very pleased that we were able to convince the hospital to reduce the size of the garage to 845 spaces and include these other uses on the block
344450 we think they are key to healing this gap between the neighborhood that has been there for 40 years
344451 part of the plan was to take the area closest to the hospital and make it a garage with a facade of residential uses putting retail on the first floor
344452 there was also a strong need for retail the retail market right around the hospital is no surprise the strongest in the area you have both the commuters and all the people coming to yale so it could support new development
344453 the neighboring pfizer development was to a great deal driven by the state department of economic and community development so to my mind they let pfizer get away with building a 3 story building and surface parking and we need much denser development in this area
344454 hopefully the next site the balance goes the other way toward the commercial the retail and the residential uses
344455 for us thats 20 to 25 acres of prospective retail and commercial space
344456 my guess is that is going to ultimately wind up being a good mix of medical office and retail
344457 were in unbelievable proximity to both the major hospitals in the city
344458 theres a pent up demand both from yale new haven and st raphael for doctors to have their private practices in close proximity to the hospital
344459 i think theres going to be a demand for residential and affordable housing in that strip as part of the mixed use
344460 with the hospital and the medical school on one side of this connector and the city on the other you have two very strong generators that will easily fill in that space in between
344461 there are two concepts here one is a stepping stone concept that if you can create without having to do an entire redevelopment if you can begin to build upon whats there and create stepping stones from one place to another thats one concept
344462 the other thats really important is that any urban development has to be synergistic
344463 there is no independent piece that can solve an urban problem you need to be firing on absolutely every cylinder in concert
344464 mixed use is really where the trend has been how to recapture what got sent out to the suburbs in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s with the urban mall spread
344465 everyone is coming back into the city so this is a fun opportunity for the city of new haven to recapture and reposition itself against suburban sprawl
344466 when that starts to happen i think people will recognize that within five years two blocks will have been redeveloped after 40 or 50 years of nothing

344483 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan
344484 dan aku datang kepadamu dengan membawa suatu tanda mujizat dari rabbmu karena itu bertaqwalah kepada allah dan taatlah kepadaku sesungguhnya allah rabbku dan rabbmu karena itu sembahlah dia saja inilah jalan yang lurus
344485 ayat yang mulia ini merupakan hakim pemberi hukum bagi semua orang yang mengaku mencintai allah azza wa jalla padahal dia tidak mengikuti petunjuk dan sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam maka orang tersebut dianggap berdusta dalam pengakuannya mencintai allah azza wa jalla sampai dia mau mengikuti petunjuk dan sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dalam semua ucapan perbuatan dan keadaan beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam
344486 tidak ada lagi yang tertinggal dari ucapan perbuatan yang bisa mendekatkan kamu ke surga dan menjauhkan kamu dari neraka kecuali semua itu telah dijelaskan kepadamu
344487 tidak ada seorang nabi pun yang diutus oleh allah azza wa jalla sebelumku kecuali wajib baginya untuk menyampaikan kepada umatnya semua kebaikan yang diketahuinya dan memperingatkan mereka dari semua keburukan yang diketahuinya
344488 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan bagimu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku dan telah ku ridhai islam ini menjadi agamamu
344489 yang pentingkan niatnya baik meskipun jalannya berbeda beda selamanya tujuannya satu pasti akan diterima oleh allah azza wa jalla bahkan ada di antara mereka yang berargumentasi dengan hadits rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam
344490 sesungguhnya semua amal perbuatan itu tergantung dari niatnya dan sesungguhnya setiap orang akan mendapatkan balasan sesuai dengan apa yang diniatkannya
344491 barang siapa yang melakukan suatu amalan dalam agama ini yang tidak ada contohnya dari kami maka amalan tersebut tertolak
344492 maka barangsiapa mengharap perjumpaan dengan rabbnya maka hendaklah ia mengerjakan amal yang saleh amal yang sesuai dengan petunjuk rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan janganlah ia mempersekutukan seorangpun dalam beribadah kepada rabb nya
344493 inilah jalan jalan lain yang menyimpang sesat yang pada semua jalan ini ada setan yang mengajak manusia untuk mengikuti jalan tersebut
344494 dan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah jalan itu dan janganlah kamu mengikuti jalan jalan sesat yang lain karena jalan jalan itu mencerai beraikan kamu dari jalan nya yang demikian itu diperintahkan allah kepadamu agar kamu bertaqwa
344495 yang pentingkan amalannya amalan baik selama amalan tersebut baik mengapa harus diingkari
344496 diwajibkan atas kamu berperang padahal berperang itu adalah sesuatu yang kamu benci boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal dia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal dia amat buruk bagimu allah mengetahui sedang kamu tidak mengetahui

344538 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
344539 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional
344540 el recurso extraordinario cuya denegaci n dio origen a esta queja no se dirige contra una sentencia definitiva o equiparable a tal
344541 en salta jujuy tucum n la rioja catamarca y mendoza se desarrollaron los sindicatos de obreros rurales cooperativas de trabajo y una intensa lucha por la reforma agraria se suced an asambleas y movilizaciones con hasta 5000 compa eros campesinos de sindicatos rurales y mineros apoyados por los barrios marginales se formaron dirigentes rurales mediante la educaci n popular logrando extender la organizaci n por toda la regi n

344543 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
344544 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen
344545 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
344546 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja
344547 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
344548 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
344549 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
344550 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
344551 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
344552 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
344553 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
344554 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon

344561 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
344562 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja
344563 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
344564 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
344565 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
344566 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
344567 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
344568 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
344569 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo

344643 caci el hadrian dorea sa puna la incercare indemanarea frumosului antinous fiul ucigasului lui argus hermes
344644 antinous era din bithynium un oras bithynian pe care l mai numic si claudiopolis si el devenise paidika baiatul favorit al lui hadrian si a murit in egipt fie cazand in nil cum scrie hadrian fie cum s a intamplat de fapt fiind oferit drept sacrificiu caci hadrian era in orice caz asa cum am spus foarte atras de cele mai bizare arte si se folosea de divinatii si incantatii de orice fel astfel hadrian l a onorat pe antinous fie din pricina iubirii pentru el fie ca el alesese sa moara de buna voie caci trebuia sa renunte la viata din proprie vointa spre a dobandi ceea ce imparatul dorea intemeind un oras pe locul unde antinous isi implinise destinul si dandu i numele frumosului tanar de asemenea i a inaltat statui sau mai curand imagini sacre practic in toata lumea in cele din urma el a declarat ca zarise o stea pe care o considera ca fiind a lui antinous si cu bucurie asculta povestile depanate de companionii sai cum ca staua se zamislise din sufletul lui antinous si ca atunci aparuse pentru prima oara ca urmare el a fost ridiculizat mai ales pentru ca atunci cand murise sora sa paulina nu i a acordat nici un fel de onoruri
344645 pe cand naviga pe nil l a pierdut pe antinous al sau pentru care s a jelit ca o femeie sunt diverse povesti despre antinous unii spun ca s ar fi oferit el insusi drept jertfa pentru binele lui hadrian altii ceea ce frumusetea si senzualitatea lui hadrian sugereaza in orice caz grecii la dorinta imparatului l au cinstit pe tanar ca pe un zeu sustinand ca prin el s ar fi dat si oracole despre care se presupune ca insusi hadrian le ar fi compus
344646 ca urmare a inclinarii lui hadrian catre luxura si voluptate zvonuri rautacioase s au auzit despre desfranarea sa cu barbati si despre pasiunea arzatoare facuta pentru tanarul sau insotitor antinous de aceea si pentru nici un alt motiv a fost intemeiat un oras numit dupa antinous si hadrian i a inaltat statui efebului

344648 the extreme criticism have affected negatively to some players and have made them so conscious that they try too hard and as a result make mistakes
344649 biarkan anak memberi beberapa jawaban sesuai dengan apa yang ia ketahui dengan demikian pun anak terlatih untuk tidak begitu saja menerima jawaban orang tua yang akan diterima mereka sebagai satu jawaban yang baku
344650 bu andi mau pulang sekolah ikut mobil antar jemput bolehkan
344651 andi mau naik mobil antar jemput wah kedengarannya menyenangkan ya coba andi ceritakan pada ibu kenapa andi mau naik mobil antar jemput
344652 ayo makan dulu dari tadi kok di depan teve terus
344653 bahkan ada yang untuk makan harus sambil nonton tv kalau tidak anaknya tak mau makan
344654 nonton tv itu kan cenderung pasif tak ada interaksi dua arah beda jika ia main dengan teman temannya ia akan aktif entah fisiknya komunikasi atau sosial jadi ada timbal balik belajar saling memberi
344655 anda tak bisa menjadikan tv sebagai baby sitter jika anda mau mendidik anak menjadi pemirsa yang kritis
344656 jika anda menggunakan tv sebagai penjaga anak sehingga mengabaikan hubungannya dengan orang lain jelas anda lalai jika anda tak memperkenalkan buku kepada anak anak hanya karena adanya tv maka anda bertindak ceroboh jika anda tak membantu anak untuk membangun hubungan yang baik dengan teman sebayanya hanya karena tv menjaga mereka di rumah maka anda benar benar bersalah terhadap mereka
344657 anak sulung saya luar biasa aktif dia juga pintar dan suka sekali bertanya kadang pertanyaannya bikin kami kewalahan teman teman saya bilang si sulung termasuk anak berbakat
344658 bakat berarti punya potensi sedangkan pintar bisa didapat dari tekun mempelajari sesuatu
344659 kalau anak tak berbakat musikal misalnya biar dikursuskan musik sehebat apa pun ya kemampuannya sebegitu begitu saja tak akan berkembang
344660 sebaliknya jika anak berbakat tapi lingkungannya tak menunjang ia pun tak akan berkembang
344661 jika ia lari ke sana sini pasti ada tujuannya jika ia tertarik pada sesuatu ia akan duduk diam dalam waktu yang lama asyik sendiri mengerjakan sesuatu
344662 namun tak berarti anak dengan iq rata rata yaitu 90 110 tak akan berbakat
344663 ada kok anak yang sebelumnya ber iq di bawah rata rata tapi dengan stimulasi dan pendekatan yang baik bisa berubah jadi di atas rata rata
344664 ia juga harus memiliki task commitment yakni kemampuan pengikatan diri terhadap tugas atau motivasi jadi ada keinginan dan ketekunan untuk menyelesaikan sesuatu
344665 jadi kalau ia mempreteli barang barang bukan karena dia nakal tapi karena rasa ingin tahunya
344666 mentang mentang perkembangan motorik anaknya lambat lantas dikira tak berbakat belum tentu lo
344667 bisa saja terjadi anak yang dulu perkembangan bicaranya lambat ternyata ketika besar menjadi sarjana sastra yang terkenal
344668 semuanya tergantung dari lingkungan bagaimana stimulasi lingkungan akan sangat mempengaruhi perkembangan bakat anak
344669 banyak orang tua menganggap bayi belum mengerti apa apa sehingga belum perlu diajak bicara
344670 itu akan merangsang perkembang bahasanya dan berarti membuatnya terangsang untuk berbicara
344671 sesekali dekatkan benda benda yang terang ke dekat matanya agar ia bisa melihat jelas atau menyentuhnya ini sama dengan melatih koordinasi antara tangan dan matanya
344672 orangtua tak melulu membaca tapi juga mengajukan pertanyaan agar si anak terbiasa berpikir kreatif
344673 dari situ juga akan terlihat derajat besarnya bakat tiap anak
344674 cukup dengan radio atau teve dari cepatnya si kecil menghapal nyanyian bahkan untuk melodi yang sulit sulit itu sudah menunjukkan bakatnya
344675 sebaiknya dalam melakukan permainan orang tua juga ikut terjun bermain sehingga anak dapat menikmati kegiatan itu dan mempunyai kepercayaan diri untuk mengembangkannya
344676 memang anak berbakat akan belajar lebih cepat dan melakukan segala sesuatu lebih baik ketimbang anak biasa sehingga tampaknya tak perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus padahal tidak demikian
344677 dampak buruknya ego si anak semakin menghebat dan bisa juga ia rasakan sebagai beban sebab seperti anak anak lainnya ia pun punya masalah emosional
344678 mencoba menemukan bakat pada setiap anaknya karena masing masing anak punya kekuatan tersendiri sehingga anak tak perlu merasa iri satu sama lain

344689 epa confirms that granite countertops pose no significant health risk undercutting junk science fear mongering
344690 i will not comment on anything that they are saying
344691 all i will say is that our position is on the web site
344692 some granite used for countertops may contribute variably to indoor radon levels
344693 at this time however epa does not believe sufficient data exist to conclude that the types of granite commonly used in countertops are significantly increasing indoor radon levels
344694 if youre at risk of alzheimers because your mother had the disease you need to make sure that you take special care of your health

344698 the differences in low birth weight and preterm births are major factors in the differences in infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity
344699 the effect size for dimebon is the largest ever seen over placebo in a trial of an alzheimers treatment
344700 and over one year when placebo patients had declined our patients were kept at or even above baseline on every parameter tested including memory cognitive function and behavior
344701 they say people improve over time on dimebon and that it has a bigger impact on alzheimers disease than weve seen before but the data dont bear out much enthusiasm for that
344702 however what is exciting is that this drug has a different mechanism of action than other dementia drugs so this is a medication that could be combined with existing drugs to possibly slow down the course of the disease
344703 it should be a given that toys are not dangerous
344704 we dont ban or outlaw products on no science or bad science there will be reputable science
344705 its going to greatly enhance the ability of the agency to do its job and will enhance the safety of the products that are sold in the united states
344706 theyll have to back those up with evidence of compliance
344707 this long overdue action is not only a victory for parents and children but an encouraging sign that congress recognizes that our chemical regulatory system needs reform
344708 improved comfort to the patient and a better three dimensional understanding of pathological lesions when they are present
344709 were not making the claim that breast ct is better than mammography yet
344710 pet ct would not be used for screening because pet is too expensive and the radiation levels of both procedures would be too high for annual testing
344711 the pet ct studies would be more useful for follow up imaging after mammography before or after treatment

344717 this approval provides an additional treatment option for patients who suffer from epilepsy bipolar disorder and migraines
344718 statins remain the primary and best treatment for people with high cholesterol especially if you have known coronary disease
344719 if you are someone dead set against taking a statin this may be an attractive option assuming you are willing to make the lifestyle changes
344720 this is one of the first studies that has shown there is some promise here

344722 its like living in the middle of a construction zone

344728 our eventual goal is to identify people with alzheimers disease before they ever have their first symptom
344729 even now with no cure for alzheimers such a test would be very useful for trials it is very hard to design prevention studies without a test to reliably identify those most at risk
344730 the extremely high intake of fish in japan may explain the much lower rate of atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease
344731 this study does not prove that omega 3 is protecting these men but we showed that artery thickness decreased as omega 3 levels went up
344732 we are not a nation that loves fish and that isnt likely to change
344733 but it is increasingly clear that we need to get more omega 3 into our
344734 the available evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with using wireless phones there is no proof however that wireless phones are absolutely safe
344735 whereas high levels of rf can produce health effects by heating tissues exposure to low level rf that does not produce heating effects causes no known adverse health effects
344736 many studies of low level rf exposures have not found any biological effects some studies have suggested that some biological effects may occur but such findings have not been confirmed by additional research in some cases other researchers have had difficulty in reproducing these studies or in determining the reasons for inconsistent results
344737 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
344738 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control
344739 people should avoid the risk factors for gerd we strongly believe that the rise in asthma particularly among adults in the country is in large measure due to lifestyle choices that can be changed
344740 until we have more information we have to assume that calories trump everything else and that our no 1 goal for the reduction of new cases of type 2 diabetes should be to reduce the intake of high energy low benefit foods

344742 these advances have transformed hiv from being a fatal disease which was the reality for patients before the advent of combination treatment into a long term chronic condition
344743 the growth is likely to be a noncancerous one far and away the most likely
344744 it is most likely to be one of the million non melanoma skin cancers detected each year
344745 if you have had one melanoma your risk of a second one is increased the first year it is as high as 15 times more likely than the general population risk that you will have a new primary melanoma
344746 much less elevated than it could have been a year or two after his diagnosis
344747 i think its safe to say that in people with fair complexions who have been in the sun for much of his adult life as mccain has been new lesions of the skin should be evaluated cautiously
344748 there is no magic formulation which can take drugs out of your body
344749 we get results that are simply suppressed so theres obviously an interfering substance the old classic way is to drink lots and lots of water
344750 the bottom line is toxicologists are smarter than drug abusers
344751 if try to cheat on a drug test we will catch you
344752 we arent suggesting that people should take statins to prevent cognitive decline if they dont need them for other reasons
344753 but we need a trial designed to determine if statins really do reduce the risk of dementia and alzheimers disease
344754 most of the evidence seems to suggest that statins are helpful in the long run for preventing memory loss with aging and dementia
344755 there are a lot of hints that statins slow age related memory decline if this is the case we need to know it
344756 our research confirmed that 60 of patients have shown a clinically significant response to the surgery and the benefits were sustained for at least one year
344757 the underpinnings of depression are poorly understood and this therapy although not perfect offers numerous advantages
344758 the pain fear anxiety and depression are pretty much completely gone and i am now a very happy healthy working active fulfilled and grateful individual
344759 the brilliant mind of edison lee combines two of the best qualities of noise rock indistinguishable melodies and pretentiousness something youd definitely hear on a pitchfork compilation so bust out your camel lights and sit back with a cool pabst and let the same box carry you away

344763 they even wrote letters to the uw trying to get me fired
344764 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
344765 i guess its only newsworthy when a cancer doctor who hasnt done any of the research himself discovers it
344766 i consider it alarmist premature and without any scientific basis
344767 that may be due to the fact that so many of these studies have been done by scientists funded by the industry
344768 the problem is that we still dont know and the science has been heavily politicized henry lai was never alarmist he just presented his findings and refused to budge from them
344769 we thought they were collaborating and interested in the science
344770 it is noteworthy that despite numerous attempts other scientists have not been able to confirm dr lais claims of dna breaks in fact recent scientific reviews have concluded that the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that rf radio frequency exposure does not induce dna breaks
344771 nobody wants to hear this and even though the corporations have cut off all the research money for this in the u s theres plenty of new data supporting this coming out of europe
344772 they were involved in an altercation at the airport in the departure lounge
344773 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
344774 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
344775 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
344776 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
344777 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
344778 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
344779 we have kids throughout high school who want to do stuff at the state level to be in the cabinet they have to come to congress one year and serve as district ambassador
344780 our job is to do what our constituents want to see happen
344781 we are their cabinet liaisons of the 4 h extension office if the statewide 4 h program is implementing new ideas and programs we serve as the contact to inform constituents and teach them how to get involved
344782 this coming january the cabinet will meet with our legislators from each of our districts in the past weve met with state sen phillip puckett delegate joe johnson state sen william wampler jr and delegate terry kilgore
344783 i also meet with people and promote the 4 h program
344784 my sister and i raised a backyard flock of chickens
344785 we started with small pullets now we have 40 50 chicks and sell them to neighbors 4 h helped me to raise a garden too
344786 theres something for everyone in 4 h from public speaking to raising chickens
344787 you can find something you want to do thats what i like most about the program it can bring many diverse people together bound by the same ideals of 4 h
344788 notorious 187 homicide falls count anywhere like the strip club next door
344789 hillary clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
344790 that is a question that i think is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention with respect to my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
344791 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
344792 because i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go its as old as greek drama there is a catharsis everybody comes they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
344793 there have been other instances where people open the holding container to liberate the mosquitoes
344794 its like the free willy movie you know liberate the mosquitoes
344795 its one of these things where youre trying to do something for the public good and you have it interrupted by vandalism it doesnt make a lot of sense
344796 that talk about liberals as if we are bad people
344797 in our prayers we should remember that were not alone that there are people who share our beliefs that we are part of a larger body
344798 theyre not hiding theyre actually reaching out and opening up
344799 we include the teaching of jesus and we appreciate the wisdom of the bible but we dont limit our sources of inspiration to the christian faith
344800 the driving belief behind it is that there is wisdom in many places
344801 unitarians response to an event like this is coming together and affirming the religious values that we care about
344802 then i said to myself the fbi doesnt normally give up on cases
344803 this is sort of a defining line that we can put all this behind us that it wont happen again to anyone else
344804 all this time since 2001 there has been much said about what our government wasnt doing and here we find out all these years later that the government was busy and actively investigating
344805 and for that i say thank you to the government
344806 so this huge thunderstorm hits when me and the wife are coming back from lake anna
344807 i looked at my wife and said honey as long as were movin were okay
344808 then the question is do you have adequate drain holes
344809 if the mayor wants to close this shelter he has to provide 300 beds elsewhere
344810 the law states that for a low barrier shelter the eligibility criteria is that youre homeless and a d c resident
344811 for those with jobs its easier to get to them
344812 for those without jobs it makes it easier to find jobs
344813 he said there wasnt anything but trouble out in the streets and he didnt want to be bothered by it
344814 our goal is to reach out personally to every family affected by this incident and to assist as necessary while the boys recover
344815 it looks a lot like a boy scout camp down there
344816 you could tell people were surprised and somewhat shook up
344817 what it illustrates is how the technologies for surveillance have developed at the speed of light but the law that controls how those technologies can be used is still back in the stone age
344818 weve got to develop some rules of the road here to protect our privacy
344819 i dont think theyve shut down any angles in their investigation
344820 if the same thing happened to this mayor i would totally sympathize
344821 the perception among the american public and even among lawmakers is that the people who are being deported are maniacal homicidal and rapist criminals
344822 in many cases theyre green card holders theyre the family down the street
344823 im so tired and disgusted with this two thirds of my life is here
344824 and they want to deport me for a 30 cent pen
344825 what somebody might judge to be minor somebody else might judge as a threat to the community
344826 the time in place you know does not exonerate what you might have done to cause somebody else harm lawful permanent residence is nevertheless a privilege granted to you by the united states and if you abuse that privilege you could lose it
344827 im not saying that its justifiable to commit a crime but the fact of the matter is lets take things in context this woman made a mistake and shes not re offended
344828 a family is going to be broken up because of this
344829 it makes them one of our top five sponsors for the week
344830 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
344831 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
344832 that were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
344833 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
344834 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings
344835 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
344836 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
344837 there is no such thing as compromise you either win or you lose
344838 did you change your mind about anything based on this entire trip
344839 what do you expect from a town where no one gives a shit
344840 if we want to carry the economic progress of saarc forward it is essential to ensure an atmosphere free of violence
344841 we have talked to other members of the saarc and most of them supported it we are now looking forward to carrying that and putting forth in the un general assembly
344842 we are keen to take the saarc from declaratory phase to the phase of implementation and action
344843 the boards approval of the safeguards agreement is a key step forward in implementing the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
344844 the historic initiative was welcomed by the iaea director general mohammad elbaradei as a milestone in the ongoing efforts to strengthen the non proliferation regime combat nuclear terrorism and strengthen nuclear safety
344845 once the nuclear suppliers group approves and exception for india and other remaining steps are completed we will submit the 123 agreement for congressional approval and seek rapid action in a short time remaining in this years legislative calendar
344846 it will provide extensive economic opportunities for us industries and recognise indias expanding role in world affairs
344847 it is a historic event and a big step towards the final approval by us congress it will provide india additional source of energy which it desperately needs
344848 we are hopeful that india will get unanimous approval from the 45 member nuclear supplier group no doubt there are some challenges in the second and third steps time is of the essence for ratification of 123 agreement by us congress
344849 like true leader prime minister manmohan singh took a bold step and risked the survival of his government for the national interest
344850 of his own volition he suggested adding an hour to the questioning the questions were to the point
344851 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
344852 let us demand that the president of the united states call a special session of this congress on energy

344855 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
344856 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
344857 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
344858 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
344859 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
344860 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
344861 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
344862 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
344863 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
344864 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
344865 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
344866 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
344867 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
344868 doesnt riding in a fighter jet and getting shot down prove mccain has experience
344869 riding in a fighter jet and getting shot down is not a requirement to be president
344870 at that point it was a political trip for sen obama
344871 i think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the mccain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in europe paid for by political funds not the taxpayers to go essentially then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign
344872 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me im more patriotic
344873 a very dear and close friend of mine and i cherish his friendship and have for many many years
344874 i am not going to start wwiii for you general
344875 both obama and clark had the courage to oppose the iraq war from the start
344876 but we have many contracts in long island we do a lot of work down there
344877 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
344878 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
344879 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
344880 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
344881 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
344882 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
344883 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
344884 i would say it just happens i wish i could explain it or somebody could explain it to me
344885 hes pretty much owned me my entire career 1 for 9 plus friday nights walk any time you get on base against him its a plus
344886 mariano is incredible you dont get to him very often and its a full moon if he walks somebody
344887 our guy was outstanding it came down to a battle of the bullpens and they beat us
344888 certain things are predictable and certain things arent but its going to be easy out there
344889 you gotta watch people so they dont drift out they panic swallow water thats the end of it

344895 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it

344901 we dont want to put ourselves in the same situation that person has been put in
344902 we have to have a witness to corroborate evidence a lot of times for whatever reason people will just not come forward and participate in the process
344903 are they going to keep us safe when we tell them
344904 then the criminals are going to be right back out there and then they are going to need someone else to snitch thats just the rules of the game thats how it goes

344922 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
344923 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
344924 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
344925 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
344926 whether its a file or an e mail if youre worried about it you should probably encrypt it
344927 i went through the whole proceedings of 1918 and pandemic influenza the worse outbreak of a communicable disease that ever hit the world was not mentioned he said
344928 not once you would never know by reading it legislative assembly transcripts that it ever happened i was tremendously surprised because i thought the politicians would be really heavily involved in what was going on
344929 there might be a vague referral to how busy the nurses were he said
344930 we are assured by some physicians in charlottetown that the colds prevalent at present are just the ordinary old fashioned cold that there is nothing to indicate spanish or any other kind of influenza
344931 miss mary herrell who died in early october 1918 after returning to p e i from her annual vacation in boston where the influenza was raging
344932 after that the death notices of islanders just went up and up and up and up said sweet
344933 it really didnt hit the elderly and the young its awfully hard to explain said sweet
344934 the items by individuals in the newspaper and the death notices were very very detailed very much admitting what was going on which seemed a great contrast to the general approach of the newspaper of what was going on at that time said sweet
344935 i dont think ive ever written anything that is nearly as extensive as this that tied into so many aspects of something
344936 his enthusiasm for this research project was fantastic said catherine a graduate of mcmaster university who is helping her father pull the book together with
344937 due to their weight and size it makes for a very fast racing machine
344938 and when you put 25 of them on the race track excitement prevails
344939 what is additionally neat is that the physical size of these cars make them attractive to the whole family
344940 even though justin is racing with racers of varied ages and experience last season he was able to finish second in their points series
344941 no doubt it takes money and a lot of time leading up to and during the weekends but do you know of any young man that wouldnt enjoy that
344942 it would be up to the council to vote and decide but i personally dont see how the town could handle that kind of money said mayor pat mcgowan
344943 i want the wellness centre but this would put the town in debt for the next 20 years
344944 from my point of view its one of the best values for money you can have anywhere in the world schmiedehausen said about the golf courses on p e i
344945 green fees are a very good price for this standard of golf course
344946 we were invited to do one of our bigger travel stories the p e i golf feature will be one of the three biggest travel stories we are doing
344947 golf punk is known for having a progressive modern readership that spends more money on travelling and thats why it made perfect sense for golf p e i to invite us over here to do the story
344948 i expect theyll finish their inspection of the scene by this afternoon said bill hogan the city of charlottetowns director of fire services
344949 when theyve completed their work there we will review the photographic evidence from the fire and go over the statements given to police
344950 if it is determined that the fire was of a suspicious nature we will continue to be involved in the investigation the deputy police chief said
344951 i think you had a requirement that everyone included in the book had a dog
344952 we built our cottage here in 1976 and our river was perfectly clear we swam in it we boated on it we dug clams and we ate the clams i wouldnt dare eat a clam out of it now
344953 if you follow the channel it has to go way down and make a great big loop around in front of the dayboat restaurant cooke said
344954 by the time it gets going under the bridge the tide is coming back in and pushes everything back in
344955 its been studied a couple of times maybe three times through the years and no one has really come to that conclusion
344956 the water is very poor in the wheatley river area it is very poor on a yearly basis
344957 this is a serious enough issue that the government created the nitrate commission in the first place
344958 when you tackle the nitrate problem in a commission all on its own youre forgetting that associated with nitrates is the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide use she said
344959 our solution is to look at the problem as a whole and our conclusion is that you cant alleviate the problem of pesticides in the air or nitrates in the streams until you start thinking along different lines
344960 i personally think this is not going to be like a mens tournament where its all pitching
344961 there will be lots of hitting and good defensive plays if people come out and support it theyll be pleasantly surprised
344962 surprised at the high level of play most of these girls on the top teams are down in the u s on college scholarships
344963 its a high tempo fast paced game and there will be lots of excitement theyll get to see the ball go over the fence get to see pitchers throwing in the mid 60s miles per hour its going to be very good ball
344964 were excited to play some eastern teams for a change
344965 we havent played a team from eastern canada the maritimes for the last three years
344966 we actually finished second in alberta this year to a very good team from edmonton canadian xtreme
344967 were expecting the ontario teams certainly ontario one pickering and ontario two cambridge b c vancouver and saskatchewan one saskatoon to all be very very tough teams
344968 has accomplished a great deal for the program during his 14 seasons and continues to have my support as an outstanding leader
344969 we had a good discussion of the issues surrounding a small percentage of african americans playing in all of college baseball and our baseball program i continue to have great admiration for him as a quality young man
344970 meant to be an exploration of joy and exuberance emotion personified in the play of light and color on canvas and paper
344971 i think people like the sweet corn bread with the hot dog
344972 it makes the patrons thirsty and then they come back for one of our delicious lemonades
344973 people cant believe how we can get them to stand up and not stick together
344974 corndogs we love the corndogs thats why we come to the fair
344975 chop on a stick its well seasoned and its very tender
344976 malones state fair taffy the sight of just makes you want to eat it and it melts in your mouth
344977 funnel cakes i like the smell and they remind me of when i was little
344978 i cant tell you how that happened i really dont know it does seem unusual why it changed like that
344979 i am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me how do i know that when we get in the alley you wont hold me up against the wall pull up my skirt and have your way with me
344980 set the goose down cover him with the bucket put the paint on top of the bucket and ill hold the chickens
344981 he is returning from a holiday he has had leave peter costello and i meet regularly to discuss a whole variety of things
344982 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
344983 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the frontbench
344984 but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time
344985 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
344986 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
344987 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
344988 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
344989 i put my finger in the air and the wind was blowing the other way besides more voter want oil that care about the shoreline so im throwing environmentalists under the bus
344990 youre asking me to go to a place where there are two thousand women and they all speak airplane
344991 for her to spend any more days of her life healing from unnecessary wounds you know its just taking away more days of her life
344992 theres no hummus or tabouli no stuffed grape leaves no kibbe no baklava
344993 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
344994 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
344995 if you think this is just about playing football then you werent listening during the recruiting process youll find this is not like any other program we know you have talent and that you can play football but the truly great thing about our program is that it matters how you use that talent to influence the lives of others how you help to shape peoples lives
344996 im hoping to help the team as much as possible our team has so much potential and im excited to be a part of it
344997 he is returning from a holiday he has had leave peter costello and i meet regularly to discuss a whole variety of things
344998 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
344999 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the frontbench
345000 but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time
345001 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
345002 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
345003 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
345004 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
345005 have not recognized the gravity of the flaws in the tanker acquisition process
345006 concerned that the leadership of the air force and defense department have not fully considered serious national security issues including several classified matter that i was briefed on by the intelligence community
345007 raise troubling questions that are much broader than the selection of a new tanker
345008 until such time that i feel the air force and dod have adequately addressed all these issues
345009 what kind of muslim are you do you consider yourself a liberal or progressive muslim and if you are and if you are pm what do you think of the issue of homosexuality will you decriminalise homosexuality in malaysia
345010 what kind of muslim am i i am a muslim
345011 if i were to show a bit of tolerance you will say there got you the law is there what do you expect me to do it is not our business to probe peoples personal lives you cant just attack people beat them up and force him to admit that he was a homosexual
345012 if you were pm will you allow chin peng to return to malaysia will you allow them to set up a political party
345013 why not there were not many communists around the world these days chin peng has been in exiled for decades if we want to talk about crimes by communist insurgencies how about access done by others too i will say lets move on

345018 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
345019 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
345020 several schools were given half a day off and this saw children and their parents staying indoors
345021 shops are normally closed from around 2 pm to around 4 30 5 pm they might have extended the time by half hour today because of the eclipse
345022 during the hours of the eclipse it is not advisable to have food intake and output taking food will have affect digestion
345023 people believe uv rays might harm food kept outside but that is highly unlikely and medically no harm comes out of eating when there is a solar eclipse
345024 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
345025 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
345026 i am a 31 year old american man and tried the personals in the us i had little luck with local dating and regional dating sites however when i started using the russian personals the response was overwhelming why are the finest russian women so much more interested in corresponding with american men than are american women interested in corresponding with american men
345027 marriages between russian women and american men are very successful and harmonious
345028 families of this kind where husbands are americans and women are russians prove to be long living as the roles in the family are clearly distributed and the mechanism operates good although these are mixed families in such families each of the couple is ready to make concessions and on the whole wonderfully performs the role

345030 what effectively will be happening is you will be able to see exactly what our tax cut programme costs exactly what labours cost exactly what we are delivering what differences or priorities weve chosen over labours
345031 so that will be extremely clear cut and rather hermetically sealed
345032 do you want to talk to give me your side of the story
345033 on stage on television or on the radio waves everyday i feel lucky because im always on
345034 in my business its essential to be contactable 24 7 i couldnt organize as much as i do without being always on
345035 ive seen people get out of their wheelchairs and dance more times than i can count so im happy i can make a difference playing for those who are less fortunate than me
345036 i must stress that the nrl and not the clubs should look at paying on top of a players club contract a separate commercial contract for elite players
345037 an elite groups of say 30 players based on what that players is worth to the game commercially
345038 say the most a top end player can get from the nrl as a top up sum is 300 000 and the minimum is 100 000 then the average per player will be 200 000
345039 it would do a lot to stop high profile players leaving the nrl
345040 thirty players at an average of 200 000 would mean the nrl would have to find 6 million a season and would stand a much better chance of keeping its players
345041 i dont think 6 million is something the nrl given its turnover and its multi million dollar tv rights wouldnt be able to find in its next budget
345042 an elite contract would make it more attractive for those guys who people love to watch either live or on the box to stay in rugby league
345043 theres been plenty of criticism over how he left his club
345044 im looking to not just win this title i want to win all the belts in this weight division
345045 theres only two other champions holding all the other belts at super flyweight and if one of us becomes the undisputed champion its very nice and that one is going to be me
345046 i dont want to just become undisputed champion i dont want to stay too long in this weight division i want to fight for other belts
345047 im 32 i want to move because i can feel big power
345048 i can fight any opponent larger than me and i feel powerful and every day the power is getting more and more
345049 im very focussed for the fight people are going to see a strong smart and focussed fighter
345050 the homebush location is a fantastic olympic legacy and the v8s could be a great addition to an already busy sporting and entertainment precinct
345051 but we want to ensure maximum benefits to the people of nsw and the best return on the investment of taxpayer us dollars
345052 it reflects the fact that premier iemma and the nsw government want nsw to be the event capital of australia
345053 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
345054 we need to identify these people and weed them out
345055 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
345056 i feel bad about those other people that got killed
345057 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
345058 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
345059 im going crazy here i wish theyd tell me something
345060 in 1999 i said the federal financial assistance management improvement act was an important step toward detangling the web of duplicative federal grants available to states localities and community organizations
345061 while some progress has been made to detangle that web work remains to be done and i hope that congress will quickly reauthorize this law so that omb and federal agencies continue those efforts
345062 we want every agency to designate somebody and say this is part of your job
345063 keep records or something on whether the payments were proper
345064 does someone have to certify that the payments were proper to begin with
345065 we are like every other side that is in fourth to 12th or 13th were all under pressure because every game is so important sometimes you run into form sometimes you dont
345066 i think that some top sides can generally hold their own but we are clearly one of the middle ranked sides and you fluctuate accordingly and when you do that you appear slow you appear lacking confidence
345067 id say yes weve lacked confidence and yes when youre chasing you do look slow then it starts to affect other things the skill level we know what the skill level against hawthorn was like
345068 it will turn so long as the players believe and thats why every week you go in with some confidence
345069 because you just know at some stage you keep at it and you keep at it and the good people that are good players will turn it around at some stage for you
345070 youve got to win the ball out of the centre before your forward line functions but when it gets there their forward line can function very very well
345071 theyre an extremely good football side were not playing good football at all at the moment were too reliant on too few and unfortunately at this stage were lacking in a lot of areas
345072 im not too sure whether hell be ready next week because hes mentally tired
345073 here and there i get an offer but it only lasts like two weeks and then i lose my job again
345074 businesses are cautious about hiring and theyre trying to cut their labor costs any way they can thats going across the board and its reducing the number of full time workers its reducing overtime its just reducing the average work week
345075 even if its not in the field im in its still you know if someone is laid off from working in a fast food place they might try and get a job im going for
345076 i look for a job every day but i cant find a job
345077 very soon you will be able to restrict who can comment on your videos but for now we want everyone to have a play around and familiarize themselves with the feature
345078 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
345079 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
345080 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
345081 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

345088 i cant remember whether you had a full beard this morning and by the way am i hot or oh oh my god that stupid chair rail is gone
345089 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
345090 one of the reasons why i dont talk about the lsb as much anymore is i dont want to exceed expectations for what it can deliver
345091 it is critically important for linux to have an easy way for software developers to write to distro n whether its red hat ubuntu or novell
345092 ive had for the past 18 months 50 full time engineers in moscow working just on the lsb 4
345093 the benefit to the community in terms of the work that they are doing is going to be a lot more rigorous tests
345094 the future of linux that i would love to see is upstream projects adopting our tests
345095 look at a project like ruby and they have a model that when you write code you submit a test along with it it makes the project high quality because of the rigorous tests
345096 the thing that i want to see from the lsb and the linux developer network is a set of dead simple tools so that isvs can take advantage of the standardization work weve done
345097 the standard is not punitive and no one will go to jail if they dont comply with the lsb
345098 there will be application vendors that will want to certify to lsb 4 as there will be broad enough coverage in the specification for them to build multidistribution applications
345099 our tools are a quantum leap ahead of where we used to be

345102 i know baby now get under the table right now
345103 ok except when they asked me to swim across the lake for a swim test
345104 one of the kids told me there was a 70 pound tuna that lives in the lake that is dangerous and bites
345105 tunas dont eat humans and there are no tunas in this lake tunas live in cold water environments like oceans
345106 your daughter is the red head and who are you
345107 i believe theyre going to come through in the clutch and keep getting better
345108 all the guys are doing our part one after the next
345109 i thought we did a good job of laying off pitches getting him in trouble but we didnt do a very good job of keeping him in trouble
345110 on the essential issues were still working from a deficit
345111 we may judge that the bush administration in its last two years was able to turn iraq from a situation of disaster to trend lines that are much better than anyone thought possible
345112 die wachsende gewalt bewaffneter gruppen verwandelt tag f r tag immer gr ere regionen afghanistans in gesetz und rechtlose r ume in diesen gebieten werden wiederaufbau und humanit re hilfe t glich schwieriger

345114 the figures are just about in line with market expectations and they refer to the old waterford wedgwood we have to put this behind us
345115 they will eventually clear tomorrow and die out and become more isolated but later in the day and on sunday there will be heavy showers
345116 it was a freak rainfall that hit this particular area with a vengeance ultimately nobody could deal with an act of nature like this but we will be reviewing the services that are in place and when we assess the whole cost to the county council and its going to be a very substantial figure
345117 we will be seeking special funding from the minister of the environment
345118 naturally i was devastated when we came down this morning because we couldnt down before then because the water was so high
345119 were not going to comment on the number of suspected cases that get reported to us between suspected cases being confirmed clinical vigilance led to the rapid diagnosis of pml this speaks for the physician educational programmes that are going on in united states
345120 id rather not say but the risk of pml is clearly stated in our label they sign something that they understand that risk
345121 clinical vigilance is clearly working as weve seen in these cases
345122 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
345123 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
345124 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
345125 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
345126 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
345127 if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
345128 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
345129 i do not believe there is anyone who does not know that i am in the detention unit
345130 they draft high rhetoric strategies which are weak on specific targets or policy tools the strategies take no account of the resources required removing the critical link for success
345131 recognise the professionalism of the staff of the health service in continually striving to better meet the needs of the public
345132 in view of this the hospital has as a precautionary measure taken the decision to restrict admission to the unit temporarily this has implications for the hospital in the management of critically ill and high risk patients therefore all patients who may require critical care services will be transferred to other intensive care units in the region
345133 immediate measures are being put in place to deal with the situation
345134 the possibilities for this new technology are huge using a handset or mobile device they will be able to seamlessly roam from one wireless hotspot area to another
345135 an audaciously designed 45 000 s f gallery would beautifully serve the university as a gateway park like attraction on the entire block east of belvidere bordered by broad henry and grace streets the sites proximity to the new fine arts building and the burgeoning gallery scene along west broad would draw focus and make a powerful statement for vcu it is my understanding that a portion of that property is on the market

345141 you are right to be proud of and interested in your home town it is an amazing city i am not a native and i think it is one of the most remarkable cities around i just love it the site of our new gallery is at the moment dictated by two factors one is that the site has been approved by the board of visitors in the master plan of some years standing and the second is much more pragmatic vcu already owns the site property wed have to dig around and raise quite a bit more money were we to build on broad street and we have more than enough to raise as it is

345194 i dont agree with everything they write but im not going to out people
345195 a lot of this is political satire and anyone who reads blogs understands what i mean
345196 what makes these blogs so attractive is that it allows open discourse of issues that usually involve political satire on an anonymous basis in other words everyone blogs under a pen name

345227 rampage demanded silence when he wasnt offering words of faith he spoke of a wolf in sheeps clothing and people aligned with the devil mentally he wasnt there said the source it was almost as if he was possessed he heard voices he thought he was a god three days later rested and nourished rampage was reunited with friends he would still make comments that were slightly weird said jacksons longtime associate you could tell that he wasnt all the way there but each day you could tell he was better against lawyers advice jackson has gone out several times fan requests for autographs at a local mall have been happily fulfilled his only other trips are to outpatient treatment which he attends daily he knows what he went through
345228 he knew he had an emotional breakdown that led to a mental breakdown
345229 under the gun to draw ratings the company is attempting to put together middleweight akiyama against heavyweight mirko cro cop the countrys most popular foreign fighter
345230 i was asked by the members of media if im willing to fight overeem since he challenged me twice already i watched dream 5 and i was happy to see a strong heavyweight match up on the card i have no doubts that dream will put more match ups like that in the future it was a very good performance by alistair i must say im happy to accept his challenge and im looking forward to this fight as i believe that we can deliver an entertaining fight now its up to dream to make this fight happen im ready to face my challenger on the next show already
345231 i spoke with my manager now and he said they called him and said it would depend on octobers event i might face mark coleman on december but nothing has been signed yet he wanted to face me on november and i really wanna face him i hope this time he dont run from me he said no to me a couple of times but i believe now it will happen
345232 i really havent put much thought to mauricio shogun rua lately i have no clue what hes talking about claiming i ducked him if he really needs to stir something up i really dont give a expletive he can stir something up
345233 ive never picked my opponents since the beginning i dont go around picking my opponents i let the promoter do that whoever the promoter picks thats obviously who the fans want to see
345234 if a fight with rua is something that interests the fans if thats something that the ufc wants to make happen i dont go around turning down fights shogun is fine
345235 as far as shogun being on the top of my list hes not
345236 i have no reason to want to fight his ass i already fought him and beat him as far as him indicating the fact that ive ducked him thats wishful thinking on his part
345237 my retina was damaged possibly detached and the laceration was pretty long it was basically from one end of my eye to the other they did laser surgery that took about two hours put some stitches on it basically
345238 i told my agent ken pavia i have nothing against kevin but personally i dont want him to fight again until he gets his hands fixed i dont want any other fighter to go through what i went through
345239 i dont think its cool that he fought with his hands like that it put himself and others that hes competing with in danger just look at me i can accept a loss but i cant accept a loss or the consequence of someone elses wrong doing in a fight like that
345240 i decided to stop and watch from the outside in order to be able to see everything that happens inside fighting
345241 i had to find myself its my aim to fight once or twice by the end of the year but the most important thing is to come back well prepared to come back different from what i was i want to be a much more dynamic fighter in the next phase of my career
345242 in america the crowds noisier more agitated and wants to be entertained for them sometimes its not important that an american wins they want to watch a great fight and we have to adapt ourselves to that i like the japanese people a lot and i would like to fight in japan again but if america is dominating the market i want to be there ive already fought against almost all of the top fighters i want very much to be part of this new market im waiting on a good contract to make my comeback im doing my part to be well prepared and ill be back to dominate the scene
345243 when i arrived at carlson gracies gym at 16 years old i already wanted to fight in mma and one of my specialties was taking my opponent down striking him and hurting him from that position this was cut from mma when i went to fight in japan in the ufc you can use the cage which is perfect for me because once you have your opponent in the corner theres no escape its excellent to use to get the takedown once on the ground its perfect for striking its fatal with those rules i guess the referee will have to stop a lot of my fights quickly because my great strong point is striking from above from any position the third factor i see is that anyone in the ring who gets tired in five minutes is in the wrong place im accustomed to fighting one 10 minute round and two five minute rounds in the ufc its three five minute rounds which is like childs play for me im flying in and out with that time i wouldnt even stop to wipe my forehead the ufc rules were made for me no doubt about it
345244 i think the promotion would have to be the ufc because it offers the best proposals and the best fighters and its the best event and the best show the best opponent for me is whoever has the belt but i dont think theres any way to come back and fight right away for the belt
345245 i passed the medical board and my license to fight was obtained without any problems but the fact is that in california the commission is very rigid for admittance one of the main conditions to let you fight is the ability to pass all of your tests on time i had to be in america by july 13 the visa was only good until the fourteenth and my tickets were purchased in advance for the fifteenth on the whole i was late they thought the organizers could agree and settle the problem but they quickly found out they would not be able to get me on the card instead they were able to find a suitable replacement for paul buentello the laws in california are so rigid
345246 yeah i believe i will be fighting but im going to let affliction do all of the announcing
345247 oh yeah its a big double standard im sure if i were the ex middleweight champion i could get away with stuff im sure if i would have done id be banned
345248 its definitely frustrating i was upset of course but im going to keep on fighting it could be a blessing in disguise with the other organizations out there
345249 its like a three year deal with the the ultimate fighter and all
345250 i think they can release you whenever they want so yeah they kind of let me go
345251 i thought the whole thing was blown out of proportion
345252 i just said what goes around comes around kind of meaning about the double standards not meaning anything bad i guess they kind of took it the wrong way but i didnt mean anything bad by it
345253 i actually really dont know if it is i think its kind of funny because i definitely didnt make those comments to piss anybody off
345254 huerta is one of a growing number of zuffa contracted fighter who feel that there is a disconnection between the companys success and the way fighters are compensated
345255 hes also unhappy with the terms of his current contract but to huerta the press tours underscore a larger point by and the large zuffa does not treat its contracted fighters with sufficient loyalty or respect he argues that many ufc fighters barely make enough to cover their training expenses he brings up teammate keith jardine repeatedly incensed that a main event fighter is working for ten and ten 10k to show and 10k to win while his opponent regularly makes ten times as much
345256 huertas expression hardens and becomes more animated as talk turns to endorsements
345257 the truth is i dont really care if i fight in the ufc or somewhere else huerta says

345263 the perceived superiority of capacities of endurance is double edged for women the assumption that they may be able to cope better may lead to the expectation that they can put up with more pain that their pain does not need to be taken so seriously
345264 gone through psychoprophylaxis classes feel guilty if they relent at the last minute and ask for an epidural
345265 these attitudes imply that we have a value system endorsed by some parts of our population that suggest women should be encouraged to keep a stiff upper lip
345266 bias toward psychogenic causation for disorders in women has occurred even in well defined painful biological processes despite the well documented presence of organic etiologic factors the therapeutic literature is characterized by an unscientific recourse to psychogenesis and a correspondingly inadequate even derisive approach to their management

345280 as my husband explained steroids magnify all emotions my experience confirmed that
345281 saya tidak puas dengan kuku jemari saya gundek gundek pendek melebar jelek
345282 apa yang salah dengan itu itu lebih ke faktor genotip nyonya kalau kuku jemari anda kotor pucat atau tak terawat mungkin anda baru butuh bantuan profesional
345283 berapapun akan saya bayar kalau perlu 2 x lipat yang dokter ajukan
345284 dengar nyonya ini bukan soal uang tapi ini lebih ke soal dampak psikologis setelah nyonya melakukan operasi semacam itu
345285 apakah nyonya sudah tahu bahwa untuk melakukan operasi seperti itu kita butuh ruas tulang lain untuk menambah dan menyesuaikan keinginan nyonya
345286 maksud dokter saya harus merelakan ruas tulang jemari kaki saya untuk dicangkok ke jemari tangan saya
345287 itu tidak akan banyak berarti karena ruas jemari kaki anda pasti tergolong pendek juga bahkan lebih pendek dari ruas jemari tangan
345288 jadi dokter mau menambah ruas tulang jari jari saya dengan tulang apa tulang monyet
345289 sabar nyonya tidak perlu emosi itulah yang saya tadi sampaikan nyonya lebih menuruti emosi tanpa menimbang faktor faktor lain saya malah sudah mempertimbangkannya dari berbagai segi yang mungkin nyonya belum berpikir kesana
345290 tapi pernah kan ada orang yang melakukan operasi memperpanjang jemari tangannya
345291 nah benar kan ada pasti ada jadi saya bukan orang pertama yang ingin menyempurnakan jemari tangan saya
345292 sudah sudah saya pikirkan dan sudah saya putuskan kalau tidak buat apa saya capek capek kemari
345293 namanya dokter basuki kabul ahli bedah tulang ini kartunama nya
345294 setahu dokter operasi seperti ini menggunakan tulang apa apa pake tulang sintetis atau logam emas barangkali seperti gigi palsu kan ada yang dari emas
345295 gigi bisa diganti emas atau perak karena pada dasarnya ia tak bergerak dan hanya menempel di gusi nyonya kalau tulang jari jari kita kan untuk bergerak
345296 anda tanya langsung saja pada dokter basuki kabul dia lebih ahli dan lebih bisa menjelaskan soal itu
345297 bisa semua jari jari tangan kita pada dasarnya bisa di operasi jangan kan yang normal yang cacat atau tidak ada jarinya sekalipun saja bisa kok nyonya tenang saja
345298 soal beaya itu gampang ada beberapa hal yang harus saya sampaikan terlebih dulu
345299 kalau nyonya sudah paham dan setuju syarat dan kondisinya silahkan menandatangani terlebih dulu surat surat ini
345300 saya diberi penjelasan langsung saja dok saya nggak suka yang berbelit belit
345301 oh maaf eh begini nyonya dalam surat ini nyonya harus memberikan tanda tangan tanda setuju dan sepakat kalau saya akan mengambil ruas tulang jemari kera betina sebagai ganti ruas tulang milik nyonya yang akan kita buang
345302 apa nggak ada stock lain yang lebih mendekati manusia dok
345303 paling mirip dengan tulang jemari manusia ya tulang kera nyonya kalau yang lain tidak bisa penyesuaian syaraf syaraf motoriknya kan berbeda
345304 maksud saya bahan tulang lain tulang buatan kek apa kek
345305 belum pernah dibuat nyonya lagipula kan nantinya tidak akan kelihatan pada tahap finishing nya kan tetap kita balut lagi dengan kulit nyonya kembali masa ada orang yang akan bisa melihat di dalam jemari tangan nyonya yang lentik dan cantik itu ternyata tulang monyet
345306 oh itu pasti makanya mahal nyonya yang melakukan operasi nanti langsung saya sendiri
345307 aduh gimana ya habis tulang monyet sih saya kok jadi geli ya
345308 hmm kalau ruas tulang jemari manusia memang nggak bisa ya dok
345309 jadiii kalau nyonya kepingin diganti dengan ruas tulang jari jari manusia itu artinya nyonya menyuruh saya mencari jemari manusia yang masih hidup buat dipotong lalu ditaruh di jemari nyonya
345310 saya melakukan operasi jenis ini bisa dikatakan jarang sekali nyonya karena untuk mengorbankan seekor kera hidup saja saya sudah dihantui rasa bersalah yang dalam
345311 saya tidak mau melakukan operasi apalagi yang mengorbankan jiwa manusia lain
345312 begini saja dokter yang jadi masalah disini sebenarnya kan karena dokter yang harus mencari bahan material ruas tulang jemari itu sendiri
345313 memang harus saya karena akan saya cocokkan dengan fisionomi dan anatomi ruas tulang jemari nyonya ini pekerjaan
345314 saya yang menyediakan bahan materialnya dokter bagian yang pelaksana operasinya
345315 dokter tidak usah khawatir soal biaya buat tagihan ke saya sebagaimana pasien pasien lainnya kalau perlu lebih mahal tidak jadi masalah saya cuma pingin bagaimana kalau yang cari bahan material pengganti ruas tulang jemari saya nantinya adalah dari pihak saya
345316 boleh saya tahu apa anda juga memberikan les privat piano di rumah

345369 this organization does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the west bank

345375 the mandatory shall be responsible for seeing that no palestine territory shall be ceded or leased to or in any way placed under the control of the government of any foreign power
345376 nothing in this chapter shall be construed in or of itself to alter in any manner the terms of existing international instruments to which members of the united nations may respectively be parties
345377 does not affect any right obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination
345378 the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies
345379 this territory was not occupied in the sense of the geneva convention since those rules are designed to assure the reversion of the former legitimate sovereign which in this case does not exist
345380 had not been taken from a legitimate sovereign the fourth geneva convention and the hague regulations 1889 1907 were inapplicable there
345381 the convention applies only to acts by one signatory carried out on the territory of another the west bank is not the territory of a signatory power but an unallocated part of the british mandate the controversy about jewish settlements in the west bank is not therefore about legal rights but about the political will to override legal rights
345382 resulted in a lapse or vacancy of internationally recognized sovereignty the west bank was in legal jargon res nullius a thing belonging to no state
345383 sovereignty in international law may be acquired by any state in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means
345384 that israels presence in the territory constitutes an occupation is utterly specious

345392 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute

345534 todo lo que ganamos durante el a o en las presentaciones que hacemos en fiestas lo reinvertimos en el espect culo del teatro
345535 creo que ya nos ganamos un piso y estamos empezando a cosechar los frutos de tanto sacrificio pero da bronca ver que se desperdicia tanto talento en tucum n

345556 and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it
345557 for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of kings he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and with his axes he shall break down thy towers he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground and they shall make a spoil of thy riches
345558 all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more
345559 nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made his army labor hard against tyre every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare yet neither he nor his army got anything from tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against it therefore thus says the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt to nebuchardrezzar king of babylon and he shall carry of its wealth and despoil it and plunder it and it shall be the wages for his army i have given him the land of egypt as his recompense for which he labored
345560 and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people shall fall with them by the sword and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he and his people with him the terrible of the nations will be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain and i will make the rivers dry and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt and i will set fire in egypt
345561 thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharoah king of egypt and will break his arms and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries and i will stengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break the pharoahs arms i shall put by sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt
345562 it egypt shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations
345563 so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt
345564 israel will no longer expect any help from egypt whenever she thinks of asking for it then she will remember her sin in seeking it before

345568 democrats want high prices because that makes them more european driving those little smart cars and paying a lot for gas
345569 people here in africa are willing to risk death trying to leave for europe or the usa but they are not willing to take that risk staying to develop something here in africa
345570 life can be really good or really bad wherever you live people need to understand that even though mali is poor we still have good quality of life you can walk outside and smile and someone will smile back i have thought about it a lot and i am not convinced poor countries necessarily have a worse quality of life then rich countries

345581 i tell you sonny we had boarded this fine ship and there was fighting going on all around this mate i was battling was pretty good and he made a lucky swipe with his sword and took me hand clean off
345582 i was standing on the deck one day when a seagull flew down and pooped in me eye
345583 do you expect me to believe that you lost your eye because some bird pooped in it
345584 me deb a retirar no solamente de la vida pol tica sino tambi n de las oficinas del partido y desaparecer completamente de la esfera p blica en una palabra resultar lo suficientemente invisible para que los acuerdos de dayton se aplicasen por completo
345585 un trato as hab a sido inmoral y falto de tica
345586 he cantado canciones he hecho una peluca un lapicero y hemos actuado en el teatro
345587 este a o hemos prolongado el campamento una semana m s estamos barajando incluir todo el mes de agosto para el a o que viene
345588 es el mejor recurso para conciliar la vida laboral y familiar no se ha dejado ninguna familia sin atender
345589 se trata de educar en valores realizan talleres de educaci n para la no violencia de manualidades y tambi n clases de apoyo escolar para aquel ni o que lo necesite adem s este a o la tem tica han sido los juegos ol mpicos
345590 ha habido muchas actividades hemos hecho juegos de agua un lapicero pero lo que m s me ha gustado ha sido la excursi n que hemos realizado a un parque acu tico
345591 este es mi primer a o y me ha gustado mucho
345592 en dicha reuni n se abord el papel de cada profesional para que no haya ning n roce competencial
345593 primarse para que est el menor tiempo posible en urgencias y se cumplan al mismo tiempo sus derechos
345594 aqu en el pueblo y en los de los alrededores todo el mundo piensa que estos tres fuegos han sido obra de un pir mano y se est investigando esta posibilidad
345595 es demasiada casualidad que tres fuegos salten a la vez y en cuesti n de horas en la cuenca del guadiaro
345596 no existe ning n nexo de uni n entre los tres incendios
345597 completamente respetuosa y normal sin ning n tipo de problem tica especial
345598 sus lloros son nuestras sonrisas y terminaremos a carcajada limpia
345599 no he visto estas colas en los m s de veinte a os que soy aficionado al toreo
345600 hemos venido a ver a jos tomas y hacer cola es la nica forma de poder verle ya que la plaza de toros no ha permitido hacer reservas por tel fono para este festejo y las entradas por internet estaban agotadas
345601 la curaci n de los huesos es ahora el punto cr tico
345602 creo que si gano este partido ser n mero uno si gano ma ana la pasada madrugada ser el n mero uno en dos semanas as que no importa si caigo en la primera ronda de los juegos y roger gana no este duelo ser muy importante
345603 s que estoy en una buena posici n y no s lo porque roger tenga que ganar todo a partir de aqu los juegos ol mpicos y el us open
345604 probablemente no he jugado mi mejor partido tengo que mejorar mis movimientos si quiero jugar mejor pero estoy contento porque es importante ganar en estos momentos es muy importante ganar cuando no haces tu mejor tenis y ha sido un partido importante por la situaci n
345605 hay muchos m s casos de maltrato infantil pero al mismo tiempo se diagnostican m s
345606 nos llegan casos de los partes m dicos y los informes que remiten centros educativos
345607 se debe comprobar por ejemplo si el menor sufre fracturas con frecuencia o si la quemadura se ha producido por un cigarro
345608 il nest pas assez patriotique il a un dr le de nom et il ne ressemble pas tous les pr sidents quon voit sur les billets de banque il repr sente un risque
345609 you see it was the only workers i could get
345610 you see it was the only workers i could get
345611 you see it was the only workers i could get
345612 i dont think its right i really dont think its right
345613 it shouldnt happen i mean i think were in america youre in america i think that they should go with our holidays
345614 if we want to go pray we dont have one for christians
345615 i dont view the diplomacy as zero sum its got to be either this country or that country india and china and the united states will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs businesses throughout the region and theyll provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want
345616 it provides great opportunities for capital flows that are foreign direct investment which is necessary for economic development
345617 collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas one area will be theres a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment
345618 it is a historic event and a big step towards the final approval by us congress it will provide india additional source of energy which it desperately needs
345619 we are hopeful that india will get unanimous approval from the 45 member nuclear supplier group no doubt there are some challenges in the second and third steps time is of the essence for ratification of 123 agreement by us congress
345620 like true leader prime minister manmohan singh took a bold step and risked the survival of his government for the national interest
345621 the boards approval of the safeguards agreement is a key step forward in implementing the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
345622 the historic initiative was welcomed by the iaea director general mohammad elbaradei as a milestone in the ongoing efforts to strengthen the non proliferation regime combat nuclear terrorism and strengthen nuclear safety
345623 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
345624 its the first study ive done in this field and the results are astounding they indicate a very strong correlation between this type of social factor and the risk of developing dementia
345625 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
345626 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care
345627 bought over intimidated or blackmailed into either voting for the government or to abstain
345628 can there be any greater shame for the prime minister and the congress leadership but the worrying thing is that there is no sense of remorse or guilt at these immoral and shady practices
345629 such is the degeneration of the congress party in its lust to remain in office
345630 tainted by the use of money power on a scale never seen before in the corridors of power in new delhi
345631 a berth in the union cabinet threats of unleashing investigating agencies against unwilling opposition mps and bribes running into crores of rupees have enabled to survive
345632 even before the trust vote the indications of the shape of things to come were revealed amar singh the samajwadi party leader demanded that the prime minister mediates between the two warring ambani brothers
345633 more forces have joined hands with the left parties after the withdrawal of support
345634 increasingly isolated from the people and covered with moral opprobrium for its corrupt practices
345635 to carry on the fight against the anti people policies and the anti national foreign policy of the congress led government
345636 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
345637 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
345638 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
345639 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
345640 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
345641 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
345642 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
345643 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
345644 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
345645 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
345646 the scientific community is really going to run with this
345647 blue irises these used to grow beside the church on the corner
345648 the teachers would walk by here all the kids grabbing onto a piece of a long rope id come out the door and grab my piece at the end and theyd lead us to school so no one fell behind
345649 you look just like your father did when he was 18
345650 substantial increases in welfare programs and state subsidies to public schools
345651 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
345652 senator obama and i faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
345653 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
345654 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
345655 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
345656 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
345657 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
345658 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
345659 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
345660 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
345661 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
345662 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
345663 and if or when he is well deal with that then
345664 youre playing more downs youre going out on a 70 yard sprint and then youre going straight to defense so it takes a little wind out of you
345665 we just have to have the guys we have at the backup position come in as needed and give us a break
345666 its going to be similar to what porter did and theres another package thats totally different where i could be lined up anywhere from almost at a corner position all the way to inside linebacker and rush or drop whatever it may be
345667 it seems like theyre going to let our linebackers run a little more rush a little more than last year just looking at the defense going in right now
345668 he has a good speed rush and has a lot of strength and weight to go around the corner
345669 he complements me and i complement him its going to get to a point where just by me and him rushing offenses may have to keep two backs in just to keep us off the edges and that helps out our covering dbs and inside linebackers everything rolls downhill
345670 im striving to get that perfect gear that perfect game the perfect season
345671 i just want to do better than i did last year
345672 if they need me there im going to go out and play
345673 its a great honor but many people contributed to the peace process that brought both sides together
345674 i feel honored to even be thought of for it
345675 northern ireland has made remarkable progress over the past decade
345676 the fact that there has been such progress is down in no small measure to the considerable contribution made by daniel and john in helping us to achieve a climate of understanding and a brighter future for all in northern ireland
345677 both men have been true friends to the people of northern ireland and loyal supporters of the peace process i congratulate both men on receiving these awards which are richly deserved
345678 they already know what casey can do its good that i can get some reps and take advantage of it
345679 if we could have waited a couple of years to do rate increases i would have loved to
345680 we have to do rate increases now to maintain existing programs
345681 at the end of the day water and waste collection are still a good value for residents but we know that the rates will be a challenge for some customers
345682 we will tear it all apart and put it all back together again
345683 my dream would be to go down to a micro can
345684 i love being in the city and seeing all the big buildings
345685 when shes 16 maybe shell be able to take some of the load off her dad

345687 now a septic tank smell is something different this stuff here is fresh
345688 well be driving to some event this convoy of five trucks all filled with honey buckets and its like were going to go kick some butt and save the day
345689 o povo nordestino n o quer ser visto no sul e no sudeste apenas como ajudante de pedreiro ou pedreiro ou como pobre que mora em favela o povo do nordeste precisa apenas que a gente abra a porteira das oportunidades para o conjunto do brasil

345691 v ldigt bra att svt s snabbt kom till slutsatsen att det inte var rimligt
345692 whether theyre going to be tested enough to go through a pennant race
345693 the only way you can see that is putting them out there letting them go
345694 that was frustrating giving up that run after we worked so hard to get one
345695 those are learning experiences and to come out in those situations and get big outs in a tie ballgame there its his game win or lose

345700 we know there are officers who are in the pay of organized crime and that is why we need to flush out bad police
345701 kami telah menginstruksikan pemain belakang untuk menempel ketat gonzales sepanjang pertandingan berlangsung
345702 persik tim bagus punya banyak pemain bintang selain gonzales di barisan depan masih ada budi sudarsono yang tak kalah berbahayanya jika berada di barisan pertahanan lawan
345703 namun demikian kami tetap optimistis bisa meraih poin maksimal dalam pertandingan kandang nanti malam
345704 significant public safety services to first responders across the country
345705 these agencies can ill afford to be confronted with a precipitous loss of service when dealing with potentially life or death situations
345706 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
345707 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
345708 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
345709 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
345710 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
345711 am i being neurotic or is it really not safe
345712 it just gets compounded because everything is plastic and made in china you end up worrying about lead paint plastics all these things our parents never worried about
345713 in the past six months i started freaking out about the bpa stuff and plastic toys
345714 in target ill ask other moms shopping in the same aisles what they think about a toy
345715 its really hard as a mom to know what to do
345716 as consumers were buying whats out there and you just trust the companies especially when it comes to things designed especially for babies that theyre safe
345717 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
345718 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
345719 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
345720 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
345721 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
345722 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
345723 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
345724 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
345725 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
345726 i would think an area the size of massachusetts where you cant catch any fish or shrimp thats significant
345727 for the same amount of nitrogen going in one year youll get more hypoxia the next year
345728 the longer you wait to reduce the nitrogen the harder it is to reverse course its like going into debt you have compound interest laws and you have to back out of that its not good
345729 we have asked the shopkeepers to keep a vigil on the buyers and verify their identity before selling them the bicycle

345731 this software rocks i record a station overseas at night then sync it to my blackberry so i have it ready in the morning when i go to work
345732 this is like the good old days when i used to record fm radio with reel to reel tapes but so much better
345733 this is the only program that i felt compelled to pay for and gladly have as this program does everything that i have been searching for
345734 i want to watch the silly man on the motorcycle
345735 you are allowed three wishes but i must warn you anything you get all the blondes in the world get twice as much
345736 you now have one nice house and all the blondes in the world have two
345737 you now have one gorgeous man while all the blondes have two
345738 serveraday rocks i want fridays side deal 1 or 2
345739 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
345740 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan we need to identify these people and weed them out
345741 to harness an organization as powerful as the isi would take very careful planning and coordination and that has not happened
345742 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
345743 internet explorer cant open the page address of page operation cancelled
345744 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
345745 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
345746 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
345747 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
345748 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
345749 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
345750 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations
345751 now i cant pay my mortgage i cant pay anything lights gas food
345752 ive just been crying and trying to find a way to make it work so far i havent found one
345753 it would have a detrimental impact on the quality of the herd the quality of deer and the hunting experience
345754 at this point it is only an idea generated by the wildlife commissioners
345755 essentially some thought that it would help hunter retention and recruitment bring more opportunity to hunt
345756 im a property rights individual obviously the bowhunters they want bowhunting to themselves but if you have 500 acres in north carolina who am i to tell you you have to wait until the last few weeks of the season to hunt it with a gun
345757 you want to recruit more people its going to run people off
345758 you take a kid out there and sit him in the woods and he doesnt see a deer all day how long do you think hes going to hunt
345759 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it

345761 aviation has always bailed me out of anything in my mind that is blue
345762 i can look through an airline schedule and brochure and cheer up
345763 if i can look out the bedroom and see the planes i am happy
345764 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
345765 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
345766 part of our hope is to treat them with dignity and respect
345767 in fact the arabic term that describes our team means to be a servant to all and to humble yourself and lower yourself in order to raise other people up thats what were going to try to do
345768 i hate to leave atkins because one you run into some of the neatest teachers because they have a heart for people that are less fortunate and you run into some of the neatest students because they are some of them coming from really rough situations but they find a way to overcome it and you learn stories about community and the richness of it
345769 our theory is that just as jesus came and shed his heavenly home and gave up whatever he had we would do the same try to give up most possessions in order to help others
345770 i am very happy to have the time with my family my husband and my children because you know were busy here but there were going to be kind of more focused on the people that were going to be around and each other
345771 were doing this not to be superstars but because we feel like this is what god is calling us to do
345772 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
345773 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
345774 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
345775 on the range i felt the best i have in a year and a half two years
345776 all of a sudden my neck started locking up on this left side and i really couldnt hit through the ball
345777 introduced a lot of confusion and uncertainty into the linux market which could dampen some of the future growth
345778 the sco lawsuit raises thorny intellectual property issues and analysts say poses the potential for more court battles as other companies assert rights to some of the communal code
345779 the president would bring it up publicly he looks like a liar right now because of the whole issue
345780 and ignorant pundits who refuse to admit president bush was wrong
345781 itu ciuman biasa dibilang iseng nggak juga sih bercanda canda aja

345783 ini pertama kali kami ke jakarta ini pertama kali kami ke indonesia dan ini pertama kali kami ke asia menyenangkan di sini sungguh hangat
345784 im going to have to deal with it one way or another
345785 they told me andys going to play so theres nothing much i can do about that ill just keep myself ready and be ready to go whenever they put me in the lineup
345786 if theres a reason for my demotion i dont have one they really didnt give me one
345787 were going to see what laroche can do at third
345788 hes our third baseman we want to give him every opportunity to play and get comfortable with our system joses going to move around
345789 its always been a dream of mine to be out there with him and here it is
345790 if theres one team youd want to go to what would it be
345791 ive played a few years there and put up decent numbers so im just glad i have the chance
345792 itll be better than playing every three or four days or pinch hitting
345793 id love nothing more than to be able to take the field with andy
345794 not on mine i was here first having different numbers is good enough
345795 i dont know what thats all about with him i think he carries his golf swing into the season
345796 to lose the guys we lost then come out here with fresh faces and beat the first place team man thats pretty refreshing
345797 obviously things were a little down before even this morning but these new guys walk in here you start asking questions where theyre from how theyre doing and you say hey welcome to the pirates then get to work
345798 wow just imagine if wed come out here and gotten killed
345799 yeah we knew what had just happened and to be honest we might have been trying to do a little too much
345800 we heard it was pretty emotional for some guys especially for someone like jack whos been here for so long
345801 you dont want to take that pressure with you to the mound but you do know theyre counting on you
345802 he kept them off balance pretty much the whole afternoon
345803 i dont want to have four walks i do a lot better when im just attacking guys but sure its nice to win
345804 we didnt have much footage and from what we saw he definitely looked better than on the video
345805 theres 54 games to go i dont think thats an excuse
345806 they pitched a good ballgame they played well and they beat us
345807 it felt good to be out there in that situation
345808 i know ive just got to get a couple guys out so i let her fly
345809 weve lost some power in the middle of the lineup and the whole idea was getting guys on base for those guys its not as conducive now until we see what we have
345810 we dont expect these guys to just walk in here and hit 800 right away
345811 i understand that other teams wanted jason and this was neals move to pull in guys
345812 i see what hes doing a little bit but i dont think the fans do yet hes going back to basics like this is a new organization square one stack the heck out of the farm system so that weve got prospects every way you turn unfortunately the major league teams got to take a hit while that happens
345813 look at our lineup now i mean lets be honest we had one of the best lineups in baseball and we just dismantled it but we had to take some steps back to go forward i guess
345814 you cant replace what those players brought and it was awfully sad to see them go
345815 but if you look at it jack wilsons been here a while freddys been here a little while youve got doumit mclouth its turning into their team now now weve got new guys coming in and were looking forward to it going in a good direction

345819 half of the 1000 respondents citing other priorities say they have no plans to purchase one a further 23 are likely to buy but not until sometime in 2009

345822 this came as a big surprise there was uncertainty from bocog
345823 football manager 1984 which is a rather amusing and slightly racist in a part look at what fm would be like if a 1984 version was released
345824 now first up tom this is peter from bbc sport why has benitez been remove from his managerial position
345825 well peter we have recieved an outstanding application for a job as manager from an outside party and i can annoucne that it will be the premierships first ever female manager benitez has done a grand job here at liveprool fc he has won trophies with us and most notably the european champions league we would like to make it public that we appreciate the work of rafa and we are honoured to have worked with him for a short time
345826 my a woman i dont mean to be sexist but theres no history of women managers and isnt it a big risk adam leventhal from sky sports by the way
345827 well adam i guess were just risky people eh jokes no the manager we have appointed will take the reighns come thursday morning however we cna not annoucne who yet it will be a risk but her outstanding application and the fact she has amazing contacts from abroad in the transfer market means we couldnt say no im afraid
345828 so with benitez out are you anticipating any of your players from leaving
345829 no were trying extremely hard to keep hold of our players and keep them loyal to the club we realise this will be hard due to the bond they ahd with rafa but it will be ultimately be up to the new manager to decide on the playing staff come the time when she is appointed
345830 now unfortunatly guys weve got to go were very bsy in securing the new manager
345831 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
345832 doesnt riding in a fighter jet and getting shot down prove mccain has experience
345833 riding in a fighter jet and getting shot down is not a requirement to be president
345834 at that point it was a political trip for sen obama
345835 i think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the mccain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in europe paid for by political funds not the taxpayers to go essentially then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign
345836 i am not going to start wwiii for you general
345837 both obama and clark had the courage to oppose the iraq war from the start
345838 i cant testify to the navs high speed handling in the twisties because im not an idiot

345845 it was just nice to get back on the rubber and actually get back to pitching with all these distractions
345846 i was rusty a little bit the rust of not pitching in 20 days i mainly lose a little bit of the touch for the pitches and the location once you let it go there is no way to pull it back
345847 he was better than the last time i faced him
345848 his breaking pitch was sharp if he pitches like he did tonight hes going to be tough
345849 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball
345850 i wasnt able to execute on a couple of pitches and ended up giving up homers
345851 it was an amazing thing why not doubles all homers
345852 we were trying to get 75 pitches in and i was able to go a little deeper
345853 the feeling of the game let me know i could go a little deeper or at least try i dont regret it i hope the next time out im able to do that and do even better

345915 semoga banyak yang dapat mengambil ilmu di dalamnya semua kebenaran datang dari allah
345916 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster
345917 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
345918 i mean to go two breaks down a set and two breaks down would have been tough to come back from
345919 but you know it happens sometimes in tennis when youre feeling confident and you know your opponent hasnt maybe played as well as he can throughout the year
345920 beramallah maka allah rasul dan orang orang beriman akan melihat amalanmu itu
345921 wahai orang orang yang beriman bersiap siaplah secara waspada kamu dan majulah ke medan pertempuran berkelompok kelompok dan majulah bersama sama
345922 dan sesungguhnya di antara kamu ada orang yang berlambat lambat ke medan pertempuran maka jika kamu ditimpa musibah ia berkata sesungguhnya tuhan telah menganugerahkan nikmat kepada saya kerena saya tidak ikut berperang bersama mereka
345923 initially failed to notify the new york attorney generals office about the destruction of the tapes even though citigroup learned in mid june that recordings of its auction rate desk had been destroyed
345924 citi has acted in good faith and in the best interests of our clients both before and since auctions began to fail and there is simply no basis for claims to the contrary
345925 suspended all recycling of tapes and preserved all existing tapes
345926 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
345927 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
345928 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
345929 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
345930 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
345931 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
345932 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
345933 then i hit my first tee shot on 10 and walking off the tee my neck locked up
345934 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
345935 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
345936 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
345937 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
345938 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
345939 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the
345940 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen
345941 seien auf einem berg der region freigelassen worden und dort etwa eine halbe stunde sp ter von sicherheitskr ften gefunden worden
345942 it was just nice to get back on the rubber and actually get back to pitching with all these distractions
345943 i was rusty a little bit the rust of not pitching in 20 days i mainly lose a little bit of the touch for the pitches and the location once you let it go there is no way to pull it back
345944 he was better than the last time i faced him
345945 his breaking pitch was sharp if he pitches like he did tonight hes going to be tough
345946 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball
345947 i wasnt able to execute on a couple of pitches and ended up giving up homers
345948 it was an amazing thing why not doubles all homers
345949 we were trying to get 75 pitches in and i was able to go a little deeper
345950 the feeling of the game let me know i could go a little deeper or at least try i dont regret it i hope the next time out im able to do that and do even better
345951 we have no idea whether one of them is more important than another one at this time
345952 these gentlemen were valued for their camaraderie as well as their professional expertise the loss of their friendship and that of karen sandland of tishman construction will be keenly felt by all of us here
345953 as a child that was his dream to be a pilot
345954 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
345955 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
345956 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
345957 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
345958 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
345959 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
345960 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
345961 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
345962 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
345963 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
345964 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
345965 guitar hero is a really funny craze kind of like the hula hoop
345966 it also is one big reason why so many really young kids are showing up at heart concerts these days
345967 we usually shoot for the same vibe and pick players and vocalists that will work with the song
345968 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
345969 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case
345970 what they did was file for a preliminary injunction over the thanksgiving holiday trying to disrupt sales of guitar hero on a theory that just doesnt hold water
345971 ya rasulullah kami melihat seolah olah engkau menanggung penderitaan yang amat berat sedang sakitkah dirimu ya rasul
345972 ya rasulullah mengapa setiap kali engkau menggerakkan tubuh kami mendengar seolah olah sendi sendi tulang tulangmu bergeretapan
345973 ya rasulullah adakah bila engkau memberitahu kami bahwa engkau lapar dan tidak punya makanan kami tidak akan memberikan makanan kami kepadamu
345974 tidak para sahabatku aku tahu apa pun akan engkau korbankan demi rasulmu tetapi apakah yang akan aku jawab nanti di hadapan allah bila aku sebagai pemimpin menjadi beban kepada umatnya
345975 biarlah kelaparan ini sebagai hadiah allah buatku agar umatku kelak tidak ada yang kelaparan di dunia ini lebih lebih lagi tiada yang kelaparan di akhirat kelak
345976 its an important decision and it speaks to the basic inconsistencies of severed mineral rights
345977 the court is saying that a mineral rights owners deed cannot be read to deprive the surface owner of their rights
345978 were pleased and believe the court of appeals laid down good guidelines for the trial court to use in further consideration of this case
345979 theres no question we have miles and miles to go
345980 it was kind of boring there wasnt a lot of execution on either side until the end
345981 rogers could have played but why scrimmage this gives us a chance to look at some of the younger and more inexperienced kids it tailback is not even a contest and never has been
345982 we want to spread the ball out and tyler clark at quarterback is a key to a lot of what we want to do
345983 all of them did some good things but philip looked really good at quarterback
345984 philip looked like he belonged just about every decision he made was the right one i doubt well settle on one quarterback after this scrimmage but juhlin took a step in that direction today
345985 no matter who you are or where you are on lifes journey youre welcome here
345986 we think its very important for our youth to see their church outside the local setting
345987 because this group is very diverse racially and culturally and geographically this is an opportunity to worship among thousands of their peers and to recognize each other as church family
345988 spiritually its been indescribable to be able to have such an impact on my peers has been really moving
345989 yesterday while standing behind the screen in the arena we had a hallelujah moment just seeing the excitement we knew we did it
345990 prior to columbine everybody thought children were safe in school
345991 up until recently everybody thought folks were safe in church people think it cant happen here or it wont happen here but it can happen anywhere
345992 i honestly dont think that has come up in discussions
345993 we seem to think of the risk as being on weekdays we have a preschool here so we try to keep them protected we dont leave the doors open for example but we dont think of anyone coming in and causing a problem on sunday
345994 we also have a special team of volunteers who walk a circuit inside theyre not in uniform and theyre discreet its a balancing act because we want people to feel welcome here but part of what makes people feel welcome is being in a safe place
345995 at some point the church leadership should sit down and think about a number of scenarios such as emergency drills or plans for fire or severe weather that kind of thing
345996 those are things that need to be decided before the time of crisis arrives its up to the church to find the right balance
345997 we encourage them to watch the parking lots anyway because of vehicle break ins and catalytic converter thefts
345998 as far as hiring armed security churches probably need to run that by their insurance companies
345999 are you going to go to the point of establishing metal detectors out front
346000 thats probably more than most people want to go to the bottom line is that you cant predict the behavior of people who are mentally ill
346001 revisit everything from front door to back to make sure we are covered
346002 weve pretty much lived with these concerns in knoxville for the 23 years that weve been here
346003 i dont think theres ever been a safe place thats one of the risks of an open society there are only safer places
346004 our time together in worship is sacred holy and precious and nothing is going to keep us away from gathering in a community of faith
346005 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
346006 when i first found out what a show runner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
346007 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
346008 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
346009 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
346010 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
346011 there was nothing that had that beautiful romantic woody allen version of new york
346012 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
346013 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes
346014 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved
346015 do i wish we got better broadcast ratings yes i wish they gave us more money to make the show
346016 i dont make it to church every week so its just kind of my way of keeping in touch with my faith
346017 we all have our traditions but the bottom line is were christians i see the rosary not as something to in any way replace our sunday worship together but rather as a way to bring prayer into other areas of our lives where we may typically not pray such as while driving or exercising
346018 its not like preaching to you or anything like that i dont think anybody would feel uncomfortable if they werent catholic listening to it
346019 the mix with contemporary music is rather unique and i think its an attraction to the style of prayer for a number of people
346020 weve used them in the church during reconciliation services for children the response has been good
346021 i was selfishly thinking of how it would look in our industry as being religious fanatics
346022 i thought he was out of his mind i wanted no part of it
346023 from that moment on ive felt drawn to do this
346024 when you say the rosary at church its kind of dry

346130 hillary clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
346131 that is a question that i think is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention with respect to my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
346132 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
346133 because i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go its as old as greek drama there is a catharsis everybody comes they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good

346142 lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink or a stranger and show you hospitality or naked and give you clothing when did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you
346143 i tell you the truth when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you were doing it to me
346144 away with you you cursed ones into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons for i was hungry and you didnt feed me i was thirsty and you didnt give me a drink i was a stranger and you didnt invite me into your home i was naked and you didnt give me clothing i was sick and in prison and you didnt visit me

346146 i tell you the truth when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters you were refusing to help me
346147 i worked with him in 2006 at the pne and last summer at the pne

346154 there is evidence that consumers are becoming more and more interested in growing their own vegetables a national survey conducted last month indicated that many consumers were dissatisfied with the quality of fresh vegetables available in supermarkets and locally the gardening magazine great gardens has sold out at the village news stand three months in a row thus we at green thumb gardening center can increase our profits by greatly expanding the variety of vegetable seeds we stock for gardeners this coming spring

346156 although the multimineral zorba pill was designed as a simple dietary supplement a study of first time ulcer patients who took zorba suggests that zorba actually helps prevent ulcers the study showed that only 25 percent of those ulcer patients who took zorba under a doctors direction developed new ulcers compared to a 75 percent recurrence rate among ulcer patients who did not take zorba clearly then zorba will be highly effective in preventing recurrent ulcers and if health experts inform the general public of this fact many first time ulcers can be prevented as well

346161 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
346162 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
346163 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
346164 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
346165 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
346166 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
346167 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
346168 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
346169 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
346170 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
346171 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
346172 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
346173 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
346174 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
346175 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
346176 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
346177 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
346178 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
346179 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
346180 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
346181 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
346182 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
346183 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
346184 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
346185 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
346186 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
346187 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
346188 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
346189 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
346190 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
346191 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
346192 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
346193 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
346194 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
346195 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
346196 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
346197 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
346198 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
346199 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
346200 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
346201 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
346202 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
346203 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
346204 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
346205 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
346206 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
346207 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
346208 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
346209 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
346210 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
346211 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
346212 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
346213 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
346214 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
346215 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
346216 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
346217 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
346218 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
346219 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
346220 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
346221 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
346222 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
346223 who are open to doing something on the production side
346224 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
346225 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
346226 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
346227 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
346228 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
346229 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
346230 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
346231 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
346232 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
346233 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
346234 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
346235 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
346236 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
346237 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
346238 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
346239 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
346240 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
346241 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
346242 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
346243 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
346244 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
346245 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
346246 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
346247 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
346248 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
346249 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
346250 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
346251 indiana elizabeth jones shared her story with the ireport community and we spoke with her mother jennifer jones the port deposit maryland resident says indiana got her name simply because her husbands family is from that state
346252 as for dow joseph jones there was serious talk of naming him jack ryan jones to keep the harrison ford theme jack ryan is the character ford played in a series of action movies instead her husband named their son dow on a dare while jennifer was asleep in the hospital bed after giving birth
346253 cnn com asked users to share their unusual names after a 9 year old new zealand girl named talula does the hula from hawaii won the right to change her name
346254 open is an unusual name but its not necessarily a name that one might expect to cause regular difficulties weaver banks however says that she often has problems with it
346255 even celebrities arent immune to the use of unusual names take boxer george foremans children all named george or actor jason lees son pilot inspektor or comedian penn jillettes daughter moxie crimefighter these are just plain bizarre names like that of ireporter holden holden
346256 even celebrities arent immune to being stupid unusual take boxer george foremans children which in a huge statement to his narcissism are all named george or actor jason lees permanently damaged son pilot inspektor really you couldnt even spell inspector right or commedian penn jillettes daughter moxie crimefighter on which he took out a lifetime worth of frustration for his own first name of ballpoint i mean penn these are just plain bizarre names like that of some poor sap right of a bad j d sallinger related acid drop holden holden
346257 as for dow jones mother she didnt go through with changing his name

346526 en la totalidad el fallo no tiene nada que ver con la privatizaci n de playas ni con invadir terrenos que est n en la zona mar timo terrestre eso se seguir respetando como hasta ahora
346527 me sospecho que los terrenos donde est el centro de convenciones y otros lugares de puerta de tierra son terrenos ganados al mar por la corona espa ola que ahora el gobierno podr a disponer de ellos
346528 los derechos adquiridos bajo una legislaci n anterior tienen que ser respetados
346529 no declara de dominio privado ning n otro terreno que no est en las mismas situaciones de paseo caribe
346530 falla porque fue muy liberal al entender que esos bienes los terrenos de paseo caribe perdieron esa caracter stica y que por ende el estado pod a comprar y vender como lo hizo
346531 el tribunal se muestra m s sensitivo a que se puedan privatizar ciertos bienes que a las implicaciones de la decisi n en t rminos del inter s p blico
346532 esto tiene consecuencias negativas serias porque tiene que ver con una tendencia del tribunal supremo a interpretar la normativa respecto al dominio p blico a favor de la privatizaci n eso es terrible
346533 nosotros estamos evaluando todas las alternativas no hemos tomado una decisi n todav a si vamos o no vamos a pedir una reconsideraci n
346534 nosotros est bamos y estamos convencidos de que nuestro criterio es el correcto que es el mismo criterio de todos los expertos que han analizado este caso y que es la opini n de los estudiosos de esta rama de derecho que han analizado este asunto objetivamente
346535 nada de lo que el tribunal expresa nos mueve a cambiar nuestra apreciaci n del derecho

346545 they were issued after two additional victims came forward stating they purchased vehicles from fields
346546 obviously we dont want to do something that would affect the structural integrity of the mortar
346547 the police dont have experience in dealing with historic brick structures and we dont want to go out with a pressure washer and blow a hole in it
346548 remove every piece of graffiti that these vandals place in our community

346555 the bill doesnt have any measures to protect anyone from the bad consequences of racial profiling to me it was fraught with opportunities for passions to get out of control and thats not a good thing for our community
346556 i think this is another stumbling block to small businesses im for the legislation but small businesses need some time to get themselves acclimated
346557 to me its more profiling before the law is even implemented
346558 these folks work very hard and long hours everybody knows this whats the big concern

346586 the money we generated got the attention of management and we are now responsible for over 50 of the sites things change when your group starts making money though they are throwing everything they can at us to try and get revenues up

346594 one person cant slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it the slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collapses and has no use
346595 as every one else has said this pool is tiny maybe good for 1 or 2 toddlers picture on the front is not accurate a 6 year old cant go down the slide with his legs out because they hit the wall my 3 year old hardly fit buy a sprinkler for 5 00 my kids had more fun with that

346600 a group of american advisers led by a small state department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the iraqi government and five major western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in iraq
346601 exercise united states control over the oil infrastructure or oil resources of iraq
346602 we did not finalize any agreement because they refused to offer consultancy based on fees as they wanted a share of the oil
346603 no bid contracts whose terms were dictated by the oil companies themselves
346604 the tendering of these fields is a big policy change as producing fields were supposed to be developed by the iraq national oil company inoc with only new fields allocated to foreign oil companies
346605 where the national oil company gets around 80 which is much more normal for fields of this size

346622 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking startups to grow their customer base and reach profitability
346623 if everyone were just filling their tires and getting regular tuneups you could actually save just as much
346624 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
346625 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
346626 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
346627 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

346640 its a very difficult climate right now on capitol hill
346641 you certainly cant say that there hasnt been an effort to move this thing

346649 am i being neurotic or is it really not safe
346650 it just gets compounded because everything is plastic and made in china you end up worrying about lead paint plastics all these things our parents never worried about
346651 in the past six months i started freaking out about the bpa stuff and plastic toys
346652 in target ill ask other moms shopping in the same aisles what they think about a toy
346653 its really hard as a mom to know what to do

346659 of course as the current administration has made abundantly clear in so many arenas talk is cheap
346660 sanctions havent worked because gas is the lifeline of the regime before yadana went online burmas regime was facing severe shortages of currency its really yadana and gas projects that kept the military regime afloat to buy arms and ammunition and pay its soldiers

346665 collins was a great gaa man he played hurling and was a leading administrator in england indeed hes probably regarded internationally as our greatest patriot
346666 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
346667 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
346668 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
346669 he had no access to dry powdered anthrax according to fort detrick spokespersons who said that only liquid anthrax was used at the fort detrick facility in animal aerosolization experiments
346670 if he had been making dry anthrax it would have been detectable
346671 these verbal and physical attacks are the work of a small but dangerous group of provisional movement hangers on who seem intent on creating a civil war mentality between the provisionals and members of the republican movement we ask the provisionals to keep their members in check before the situation gets out of control and we would ask whose agenda this is and whose it serves
346672 republican separatism is on the rise in derry and across the nation and we would urge our members not to react to what appears to be the last kicks of a wounded animal
346673 the republican project will not be dragged into the gutter by these people and we will stand firm behind the republican position

346684 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the frontbench
346685 but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time
346686 it does look like they have support of the shareholders again but at the end of the day they have to focus on the company goals and execute
346687 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
346688 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
346689 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

346711 was actually part of a team that helped the government investigate the anthrax attacks after sept
346712 so even if ivins was involved how would a high government official know that a rogue bioweapons scientist was going to go postal with anthrax if that high government official was not himself involved

346720 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion

346726 hablar del calendario de la liga siempre es muy relativo porque al final debemos enfrentarnos todos contra todos adem s creo que el calendario ser bueno o malo en funci n del estado de forma de los equipos en cada momento de la competici n y eso a estas alturas antes de empezar la competici n es simplemente imposible de predecir por destacar algo quiz el descanso obligado nos hubiese venido mejor en la jornada 2 que en la 3 al caer el encuentro entre semana aunque es una cosa de simple matiz y de escasa relevancia
346727 estuve jugando aqu en el foje con la selecci n espa ola y se nota mucho la diferencia el hielo es mucho mejor
346728 la pista es una preciosidad y el hielo es perfecto creo que tenemos que trabajar muy duro para poder estar a la altura de esta pista tanto en hockey como en art stico esto requiere un nivel muy alto de patinadores y de calidad
346729 ya era hora de que la abrieran porque hemos esperado mucho llevamos tiempo sin patinar y ahora tenemos que recuperar el tiempo perdido

346743 todo el pavimento y las redes de servicios del centro hist rico quedar n renovados
346744 que gobernaron con tr nsfugas con dudas respecto a su gesti n y poca tica pol tica
346745 es una propuesta que no tienen ni pies ni cabeza
346746 la propuesta es al conjunto de los alcaldes porque todos ellos son los impulsores de la transformaci n de la ciudad
346747 no somos qui n para juzgar los que juzgan son los electores
346748 este se or ya fue juzgado pol ticamente y no tuvo ning n encausamiento judicial fue juzgado por las urnas y no tenemos nada que decir es un alcalde que est en la historia de la ciudad
346749 su figura pol tica ser discutida pero hizo obras que est n ah todos los alcaldes tienen sus claros y sus oscuros pero hicieron sus esfuerzos y nos parece correcto y apropiado que tengan un reconocimiento
346750 hemos mostrado reticencias con aquellos que ten an procesos abiertos pero no se da el caso no lo acogemos con entusiasmo pero no tenemos inconveniente
346751 hay que recordar las cosas para que no se reproduzcan
346752 en el momento en el que las parroquias del arag n oriental pidan la devoluci n de las piezas
346753 siempre y cuando se cumplan una serie de medidas para garantizar la unidad y la integridad de la colecci n
346754 no existe un contrato de compraventa ni tampoco una donaci n
346755 no se puede deducir de aquellos actos que no sean de indudable significado puesto que la donaci n como productora de la p rdida de un derecho o de un bien sin compensaci n o contraprestaci n requiere una amplia demostraci n
346756 s en cambio prosigue se ha de atribuir a la entrega realizada una transferencia f sica del bien que a nuestro juicio solo comporta una situaci n por la que el museo el diocesano y comarcal de l rida o la di cesis se sirven de la posesi n puesto que es costumbre frecuente que en el museo se exhiban obras propias y de otros por benevolencia tolerancia o concesi n a tal fin de sus leg timos propietarios
346757 si los interesados hubieran querido desprenderse de facto de la propiedad o atribuir la cualidad de due o a otros lo habr an dicho con claridad
346758 unos y otros a ade entregaron y recibieron los bienes para satisfacer los objetivos propios de un museo no para provocar el cambio de due o
346759 en estos casos no exist a una posesi n por usucapi n por el mero hecho de poseer un bien durante un cierto periodo de tiempo tal y como alegan los amics del museu en la demanda civil presentada en mayo ya que es necesario que la posesi n se ostente no por acuerdo o concesi n del due o sino contra l
346760 la constituci n del consorcio y la consiguiente adscripci n de los bienes del museo diocesano no tienen ninguna incidencia en t rminos de derecho civil
346761 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows
346762 creo que si gano ma ana madrugada del s bado ser n mero uno si no gano lo ser en dos semanas as que no importa si caigo en la primera ronda de los juegos y roger gana no el partido de ma ana cuartos de final ser muy importante
346763 s que estoy en una buena posici n y no solo porque roger tenga que ganar todo a partir de aqu los juegos ol mpicos y el us open
346764 we are reaching out in this way in an attempt to bring 21st century communication techniques to bear and to help motivate any possible witnesses to speak now
346765 companies currently gain substantial b2b and b2c benefits by using social networking sites to uplift sales and promote their products and services yet as phishers target facebook users secure access to these sites is a must have on the security front
346766 more than anything it highlights the need for enterprises to use a secure web 2 0 access solution to prevent their staff partners and customers from falling victim to this type of fraud
346767 when you come to the border hold your card up to your window and on the border patrol screen up will pop your name your picture the fact that you are a u s citizen and the number of your card theyll peek in to see if youre the same person and speed you on your way
346768 if you live in a border community and you regularly go back and forth across the border whether its many times a week or many times a month or several times a year the passport card makes sense
346769 the first farmer counted three worms in his soil the second had four we dug mine and counted 179 worms both of them called me a liar to my face they said this is b s you put the worms in there we went out and dug another hole where they wanted in my field they counted 180 worms
346770 we will see the day when the death rate from our food system will make the bubonic plague look like a head cold
346771 dont eat fast food dont buy at the supermarket go to your own backyard or to an organic farm
346772 this year has been terrible for me the rain and cold made it impossible to grow
346773 i want all the bugs i can get i want pollinators for the flowers
346774 bugs also eat sick plants i put out toad houses and the toads come out at night and eat mosquitoes and other bugs that i dont like
346775 i had mozzarella cheese from a water buffalo once and it was the best thing i ever put in my mouth i asked what it would cost to have two water buffaloes and they said 60 000 i said id keep the goats
346776 pepperoni on the hoof every part of a pig is used by human beings except one the squeal i ask the school kids does anybody eat pig toenails they all say no way then i ask them if they like jell o thats made from gelatin which comes from animal hooves
346777 this wedge is ground beef and we have a little bull in there cows eat grass and hay the only reason midwest farmers feed grain to a cow is to get rid of their excess corn which we wont have this year corn creates white marbling in the meat which removes all fatty acids which prevent cancer
346778 these are silkies a french bird i wanted them because they are good mother hens we dont use these chickens ive got meat birds on another farm
346779 we have eight or nine grains ill grow chick peas in here best pizza dough ive ever made in my life
346780 we have seven kinds of sweet peppers i do not grow hot peppers in my garden i had a third grader break a hot pepper and get it in his eyes i had two hours of hell out here
346781 we have 24 varieties but we just put them in the ground saturday june 21 thats the latest ive ever planted tomatoes in my life well have wonderful tomatoes in september and october
346782 we normally have 90 herbs but the herb garden this year has been especially pathetic because of the spring
346783 if you eat organic food youll eat half as much because its got twice the nutrients in it
346784 thats why the pizza farm exists to teach people about food
346785 but there are a lot of hoops to jump through because i dont have a work related disability
346786 including cancer survivors and others who dont know tom have been so supportive the department is like a family what im doing is small compared to what others have done
346787 we were taken aback flabbergasted by what hes going to be doing for me and my family
346788 to have the endurance to accomplish such a feat is tremendous
346789 a good mix of a tight twisty single track through the woods some faster double track trails some wide open dirt roads and a number of extremely technical rock garden sections that are difficult to walk let alone ride a mountain bike through
346790 i have a lot of challenges but im living life to its fullest and creating memories for my children
346791 that talk about liberals as if we are bad people
346792 in our prayers we should remember that were not alone that there are people who share our beliefs that we are part of a larger body
346793 theyre not hiding theyre actually reaching out and opening up
346794 we include the teaching of jesus and we appreciate the wisdom of the bible but we dont limit our sources of inspiration to the christian faith
346795 the driving belief behind it is that there is wisdom in many places
346796 unitarians response to an event like this is coming together and affirming the religious values that we care about
346797 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
346798 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
346799 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
346800 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
346801 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
346802 because i might gain temporary market advantage but id devalue the whole category sooner or later people would stop buying soap
346803 john mccain thinks this election is about me i think its about you and in all the respects that matter im one of you
346804 granite staters want a candidate who will look them in the eye and tell them the truth
346805 a lot of people do not want to make the tough decisions
346806 theyre for education or transportation but they do not want to vote for the funding i wont be a phony if i vote for a budget ill vote for the financing
346807 today is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
346808 the fans really cared for manny so now were both depressed and relieved
346809 were depressed that hes gone but relieved for the team he wanted to leave and joe torre seems to love him were gonna be down for awhile but on the same token this had to happen
346810 became a major distraction for the team and it was time for him to go
346811 dominicans shouldnt say anything bad about manny because hes dominican
346812 when our kids leave they leave but they still stay our kids
346813 almost every year this was a pattern he started out as if he wanted to be in boston but come july and august he wanted to leave fans are 50 50 on the issue they realized the impact hes had on boston baseball but because of the actions hes taken lately especially in the last month or so it was time for somewhat of an amicable divorce
346814 hid behind his friends not having apparently the courage enough
346815 the day you killed my boy a part of me died along with him
346816 loved life and brought so much happiness to all those who have known him
346817 i do know that you are a coward and a murderer and you deserve everything thats coming to you
346818 i wanted him to see my son when he was alive
346819 i just wanted him to see what he looked like
346820 my credit will be destroyed i cant short sale i want to buy a house again some day
346821 i will have to pay taxes on the difference between what i owed and what the bank gets
346822 damn you indians are smart how the hell did you know there were buffaloes coming
346823 ive been seeing this girl for a while and shes really hot
346824 you never told me that you were such a religious person
346825 you never told me that your father is a pharmacist
346826 our intent is to yield individualized blacklists that not only produce significantly higher hit rates but that also incorporate source addresses that pose the greatest potential threat
346827 in reality those lists have a fairly low probability of success they wont provide you with proactive protection in practice
346828 we want a system that can recognize attackers before they can saturate the internet we want to give you the ability to incorporate bad actors even if youve never seen them before
346829 we call networks that share significant attacker overlap correlated victims
346830 we have demonstrated that we can exploit the relationships between networks that have been attacked by similar internet sources as a means for predicting which attack sources are likely to attack which networks in the future
346831 some people say water on mars means intelligent life more likely
346832 fundamentally this shows a lack of responsibility on a number of peoples part including chamber personnel and management at the exchange
346833 i will have to reevaluate a post chamber bowl celebration next year
346834 one of the things people in the office do is complain about bills
346835 the brain is wider than the sky for put them side by side the one the other will include with ease and you beside
346836 we will pursue peace as if there is no terrorism and fight terrorism as if there is no peace
346837 i have thought it my duty to exhibit things as they are not as they ought to be
346838 the stakes are too high for government to be a spectator sport
346839 under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule and both commonly succeed and are right
346840 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
346841 i have had my solutions for a long time but i do not yet know how i am to arrive at them
346842 whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to extensive empire the power of rome was attended with some beneficial consequences to mankind and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices diffused likewise the improvements of social life
346843 augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom
346844 there exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times
346845 our youth now loves luxuries they have bad manners contempt for authority they show disrespect for elders and they love to chatter instead of exercise children are now tyrants not the servants of their households they no longer rise when elders enter the room they contradict their parents chatter before company gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers
346846 before impugning an opponents motives even when they legitimately may be impugned answer his arguments
346847 idealism alas does not protect one from ignorance dogmatism and foolishness
346848 let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that i am persecuted whenever i am contradicted
346849 we take and must continue to take morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization we must exercise our power but we ought neither to believe that a nation is capable of perfect disinterestedness in its exercise nor become complacent about particular degrees of interest and passion which corrupt the justice by which the exercise of power is legitimized
346850 faced with the choice of all the land without a jewish state or a jewish state without all the land we chose a jewish state without all the land
346851 the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis
346852 he too serves a certain purpose who only stands and cheers
346853 the law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to beg in the streets steal bread or sleep under a bridge
346854 when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle
346855 education does not mean that we have become certified experts in business or mining or botany or journalism or epistemology it means that through the absorption of the moral intellectual and esthetic inheritance of the race we have come to understand and control ourselves as well as the external world that we have chosen the best as our associates both in spirit and the flesh that we have learned to add courtesy to culture wisdom to knowledge and forgiveness to understanding
346856 glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
346857 the most important political office is that of the private citizen
346858 if we desire respect for the law we must first make the law respectable
346859 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both
346860 it is an error to suppose that books have no influence it is a slow influence like flowing water carving out a canyon but it tells more and more with every year and no one can pass an hour a day in the society of sages and heroes without being lifted up a notch or two by the company he has kept
346861 when you write youre trying to transpose what youre thinking into something that is less like an annoying drone and more like a piece of music
346862 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
346863 the sum of our religion is peace and unanimity but these can scarcely stand unless we define as little as possible and in many things leave one free to follow his own judgment because there is great obscurity in many matters and man suffers from this almost congenital disease that he will not give in when once a controversy is started and after he is heated he regards as absolutely true that which he began to sponsor quite casually
346864 are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy and who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched is a priest to be our inquisitor or shall a layman simple as ourselves set up his reason as the rule of what we are to read and what we must disbelieve
346865 we are told that it is only peoples objective actions that matter and their subjective feelings are of no importance thus pacifists by obstructing the war effort are objectively aiding the nazis and therefore the fact that they may be personally hostile to fascism is irrelevant i have been guilty of saying this myself more than once the same argument is applied to trotskyism trotskyists are often credited at any rate by communists with being active and conscious agents of hitler but when you point out the many and obvious reasons why this is unlikely to be true the objectively line of talk is brought forward again to criticize the soviet union helps hitler therefore trotskyism is fascism and when this has been established the accusation of conscious treachery is usually repeated this is not only dishonest it also carries a severe penalty with it if you disregard peoples motives it becomes much harder to foresee their actions
346866 wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turn on
346867 the great thing about human language is that it prevents us from sticking to the matter at hand
346868 to be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a child for what is mans lifetime unless the memory of past events is woven with those of earlier times
346869 reputation is what other people know about you honor is what you know about yourself
346870 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
346871 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
346872 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
346873 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
346874 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
346875 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
346876 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still quite constrained there are no clear signs its improving
346877 governments could back themselves into a corner if they create political pressure to cut variable rates
346878 if funding costs have not declined the rational response from a bank would be to cut back on lending which would mean a further contractionary effect for the economy

346880 as a sheriff yes i do i feel they should in the state of arkansas theyre considered misdemeanors but the animal cruelty that weve seen in madison county newton county and some other counties that have had this problem this year were disturbing enough to be a felony charge in my opinion
346881 very glad the fcc is getting involved and hopes they can resolve the issue for the long term as well as the short term
346882 it hurts me that this man continues to prey on some of the most helpless people in our society
346883 my advice to senator obama is to run as a man and leader and the american people will evaluate you as such not as a victim
346884 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
346885 to suggest he is a discredit to congress is wrong
346886 ill tell you why i am 86 some of our veterans might be about 89 right now so the next parade to go over there and say hello to all the boys that died and say thank you and gob bless and i hope you are in heaven will be in 2014
346887 we will all be in the 90s bracket maybe 95 98 in some cases or at least 93 94 something like that therefore there is not going to be too many of us and i am trying to tell the minister and i am telling him in no uncertain terms this is about our last parade this is it
346888 i dont know what percentage you would take off from that because a lot of them are sick a lot of them are not well
346889 went right through belgium holland and germany from the first battle to the last he said
346890 no one should ever forget the 46 000 canadians that died for you and me
346891 we canadians had nothing but water and rocks and the german bunkers that were still there the bunkers that killed so many canadians on d day in the first wave in the water in the water i was there i know

346895 as we grow up we learn that even the one person who wasnt suppose to ever let you down probably will you will have your heart broken probably more than once and its harder time you break hearts 2 so remember how it felt when yours was broken youll fight with your best friend youll blame a new love for things an old 1 did youll cry because time is passing too fast and youll eventually lose someone you love so take many pix laugh too much and love like youve never been hurt because every 60 seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you cant get back
346896 sometimes we put too much passion on the biggest dreams and priorities in life that we fail to love d smallest pleasures from simple things we search so much for the right choices for the right paths to walk through for the right time and for the right reason but life isnt about searching for the things that can be found it is about letting the unexpected and finding things u never searched for
346897 we have two eyes and just one tongue which means we need to look twice and talk once we have two ears and just one mouth so we need to listen more then we talk we have two hands and one stomach so we need to work twice as much as we eat we have two brains left and right and one heart so we can think twice but love only one

346907 if youre out of shape and most of us are and you want to change you have to do some exercise the way we re programme muscle in adults is by training
346908 almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise
346909 for this group of people if there was a way to mimic exercise it would make the quality of exercise that they do much more efficient

346926 while the economy is beyond our control we made excellent progress in areas within our control
346927 results like this are only achieved with focus extreme dedication and relentless hard work
346928 the majority position on how to set the budget is contrary to my position
346929 over the last several years the budget committee and the school board have consistently reduced budget growth
346930 my comment to zero based budgeting is you cant slam the brakes on without slamming into the windshield you need to slow the bus down at a reasonable rate
346931 as a rule and general philosophy the approach i like to take is the essence of zero based budgeting
346932 you look at significant drivers in the budget asking what is driving the cost
346933 what are the facts what do they mean what do we do about it
346934 forrest and i felt that it would be most efficient for the committee to have a change in leadership at this time
346935 i felt the school board was very aggressive in addressing the outliers areas of expense that warranted study and review to lower them
346936 i dont think its the most effective way to bring about change
346937 i have only one objective to find a way for the school board and budget committee to cooperatively work together
346938 i curl up in bed and the wind is howling and i see him freezing cold in his underpants trying to run away i imagine his terror i imagine him escaping and then being shot in his right eye i hear him crying for me
346939 my biggest fear is that this person will be getting out of jail and some other child will be hurt
346940 had there been a death penalty we would have asked for it
346941 killed in a brutal cold blooded fashion after he had been marched by his assailant approximately six tenths of a mile unattired in the dark in below freezing weather
346942 at one point attempted to implicate his father as the assailant
346943 he attempted to perpetrate unnatural sexual acts on a 15 year old boy at exactly the same location on the premises of the lone pine hunters club on aug 23 1968
346944 threatened the boy with a firearm chased him through the forest and placed a rock on his head and threatened to smash his skull in
346945 ill never forget that ride it was a cold cold night
346946 were this crime committed today guay would never have the opportunity to be paroled
346947 if hes served his time he is allowed to go free
346948 without evidence of a direct threat i dont think the victims mother can do anything
346949 the punishment did not fit the crime i was very disturbed he was allowed a second degree murder charge its not fair 25 years for killing a person as a father and a grandfather i want to keep these predators at arms length the sentence was light he was a convicted felon and he could not afford to let lindovski get away
346950 it just seems so unjust so unfair that he could murder my little boy and just walk out i pray that before i leave this earth he has justice i know how important it is to forgive but this little guy never had a chance
346951 i want people to be up in arms my biggest fear is this person will get out and harm other children
346952 and the laws have substantially changed over the past 25 years
346953 based on the information you the cabinet have given me registration is not required not because it was so long ago but because of the charge he was convicted of
346954 the general court further finds that the prognosis for rehabilitating sexually violent predators in a prison setting is poor the treatment needs of this population are very long term
346955 we informed him that if he submits an alternative plan we will review it

346964 the british open was the turning point where i played really well and putted really badly and decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter ive decided that im going to putt with the belly if you see me with a short one that means that something is wrong with me
346965 when i hit the ball it just didnt go straight today
346966 and i also had been hitting a lot of good putts and i made a bunch today i made some good ones to see balls rolling in now im starting to gain a little bit more confidence a little bit more momentum
346967 i remember when i won the masters in 06 i had a great week the week before
346968 the defective blade happened to be on the aircraft we bought
346969 were sorry for the loss of life and the injuries to the people there wasnt anything our mechanics could have done it cracked from the inside out
346970 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
346971 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
346972 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
346973 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
346974 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
346975 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
346976 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
346977 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
346978 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
346979 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
346980 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
346981 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
346982 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
346983 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
346984 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
346985 he may not like it public speaking so much but he is really good at it
346986 he has good things to say and people want to hear what he has to say
346987 all i can say is that i am glad to be here and its really a privilege
346988 one of the rare qualities you seen in a coach is to be able to relate to players as they see things their way
346989 emmitt could get to their level he was very good communicating with them
346990 he was one of the few players i had who once in a while would point out things i was doing wrong
346991 first of all i was surprised coach gibbs came back and after saturday im going to do the same
346992 if a coach can come back and coach i should be able to come back and play
346993 he kraft has never gotten a chance to enshrine someone in canton and i think it may not be too long before he gets a chance to come to canton and be inducted as a contributor
346994 i thought it would be good for him to come here
346995 its kind of like a wedding where youre engaged before the wedding and then as the wedding day approaches you realize its a reality
346996 im more nervous today because of the magnitude although my wedding was great let me just make that clear
346997 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go

347043 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
347044 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
347045 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
347046 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
347047 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
347048 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
347049 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
347050 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
347051 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
347052 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
347053 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
347054 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him
347055 for jason we want what we want for the rest of the players to have an atmosphere where good players want to do the right thing
347056 were not asking him to fill ramirezs shoes were asking him to be a contributing member of a winning baseball team emphasis on the last word
347057 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
347058 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
347059 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
347060 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
347061 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
347062 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
347063 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
347064 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
347065 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
347066 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
347067 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong mccarthy said
347068 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are
347069 the so called operational plan is merely a conclusory statement that the police department intends to conduct the sobriety checkpoint in a reasonable manner
347070 the plan provides no basis by which the court can determine that the checkpoint will be operated in accordance with the requirements of state v koppel 127 n h 286 and the new hampshire constitution furthermore the petition fails to provide sufficient information to show that such sobriety checkpoints in new hampshire will produce sufficient benefit to outweigh their intrusion on individual rights
347071 we do this every year and nothing really has changed
347072 as a result in the increasing incidents of drinking and driving the nashua police department applied for and was granted a superior court petition to conduct a sobriety checkpoint
347073 the sobriety checkpoint is the most effective method of detecting and apprehending the impaired operator
347074 the location shall be at or near the area of main street in the city of nashua in which prior experience shows a particular concern with alcohol
347075 the court finds that the operational plan is completely devoid of specifics concerning locales the procedures the press and public notification the pattern of stopping vehicles and other issues
347076 certainly we will re submit it and if we need to make some changes we will do that
347077 am i tough enough to stay and can i bear the isolation
347078 im so fucking cold and sick of mutton and miss home ive never smelled so bad and by the way does anyone really love me
347079 quality of life is one of those things thats virtually impossible to rank
347080 its so subjective and very individualistic thats the problem no place is for everybody
347081 in our national public relations efforts were trying to target people who already believe this is the quality of life they want
347082 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
347083 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
347084 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
347085 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
347086 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
347087 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
347088 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
347089 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
347090 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning

347112 i got to go against andre one on one a lot of times
347113 we played in an era when coaches believed we should hit in practice there were no shorts and shells on wednesday and thursday even in practice going against andre got you nervous there was that competitive spirit of not wanting him to beat you it made me a better player
347114 ive been in the league a long time so i have my own identity
347115 i dont really worry about what everyone expects me to be i try to be the corner i am thats all i can be i cant be asante i cant be ty law i cant be champ bailey i cant be anybody other than fernando i try to refine what i do and fit in the scheme
347116 asante is asante im sure you all said the same thing to asante when ty law left here
347117 asante is a great corner i have the biggest respect for him over the last couple years he had a lot of picks but the bottom line is this i am who i am this season well find out who that is
347118 he is very professional i think we all know that he is a very experienced guy and good in the passing game he has done a lot of different things offensively in his career i dont think we are doing anything that he hasnt done before it is just a question of adapting to different terminology and a little bit of refinement here and there
347119 he is a guy that has played a lot of football so we need to manage him a little bit like we manage other players at that age but it is nothing abnormal just the balance of getting him the reps and experience in our system that he needs vs not overdoing it or wearing him down for a guy who has played as much football as he has
347120 to me thats like if you got a call from the president of the united states
347121 he is a guy that picks up things quickly quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him he has been a very dependable player for us
347122 his versatility during training camp and the regular season really helps us work other players and let them get the most benefit out of what they are doing
347123 he is a guy that can bounce around a little bit and balance things out on different plays so we can maximize what some of the other players can do he is really a key guy for us and was like that last year

347140 heres the news the ontario premier said helpfully after a speech late last month ontarians are coming together to more effectively assert themselves in the face of an unfairness caused by the financial arrangements between us and ottawa
347141 the premier is always careful to say that he is a proud canadian and that he understands his province has been blessed by geography and circumstances that give it a responsibility to share its wealth
347142 mr mcguinty has earned some concessions in the past three years but the broad ranging reform of fiscal relations he is seeking eludes him his efforts seem to resonate with voters who find the notion of a 20 billion gap easy to comprehend one opinion poll earlier this year gave him two to one support over federal finance minister jim flaherty in their war of words over ontarios economic strategy

347164 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
347165 evil dies not exist sir or at least is does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of good it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
347166 it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it

347177 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
347178 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
347179 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
347180 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
347181 the long term implications are really cause for concern for every branded manufacturer
347182 its not just price its all about product performance its about the trust that consumers have in your brands

347246 the court finds the memorial at mount soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily nonreligious messages of military service death and sacrifice

347268 i walked out onto the porch and thought oh my god
347269 we live on the porch all summer long and into the fall
347270 we have meals relax entertain and sit during rainstorms it reminds me of a summer camp

347288 this is the first case within the church in which a bishop receives a dispensation

347319 ketika kau merasa paling lemah di antara yang lemah tidakkah kau merasakan cinta ku
347320 apakah engkau syekh baghdadi yang memberikan petunjuk spiritual pada orang orang
347321 aku mengucapkan bismillaah dengan nama allah aku makan yang ada di hadapanku aku menggigitnya sedikit meletakkannya di sisi kanan dalam mulutku dan perlahan mengunyahnya aku tidak menatap suapan berikutnya aku mengingat allah sambil makan apa pun yang aku makan aku ucapkan alhamdulillaah segala puji bagi allah aku cuci tanganku sebelum dan sesudah makan
347322 kau ingin menjadi guru spiritual di dunia tetapi kau bahkan tidak tahu bagaimana cara makan
347323 ia adalah orang gila yang cerdas dan bijak dengarkan kebenaran darinya
347324 engkau tak tahu bagaimana cara makan tetapi tahukah engkau bagaimana cara berbicara
347325 aku berbicara tidak kurang tidak lebih dan apa adanya aku tidak terlalu banyak bicara aku berbicara agar pendengar dapat mengerti aku mengajak orang orang kepada allah dan rasulullah aku tidak berbicara terlalu banyak agar orang tidak menjadi bosan aku memberikan perhatian atas kedalaman pengetahuan lahir dan batin
347326 lupakan tentang makan karena kau pun tak tahu bagaimana cara berbicara
347327 wahai syekh anda lihat ia adalah orang gila apa yang kau harapkan dari orang gila
347328 ada sesuatu yang aku butuhkan darinya kalian tidak tahu itu
347329 apa yang kau inginkan dariku kau yang tidak tahu bagaimana cara makan dan berbicara apakah kau tahu bagaimana cara tidur
347330 ketika aku selesai salat isya dan membaca doa aku mengenakan pakaian tidurku
347331 wahai bahlul aku tidak tahu karenanya demi allah ajari aku
347332 sebelumnya engkau mengklaim bahwa dirimu berpengetahuan dan berkata bahwa engkau tahu maka aku menghindarimu sekarang setelah engkau mengakui bahwa dirimu kurang berpengetahuan aku akan mengajarkan padamu ketahuilah apa pun yang telah kau gambarkan itu adalah permasalahan sekunder kebenaran yang ada di belakang memakan makanan adalah bahwa kau memakan makanan halal jika engkau memakan makanan haram dengan cara seperti yang engkau gambarkan dengan seratus sikap pun maka itu tak bermanfaat bagimu melainkan akan menyebabkan hatimu hitam
347333 hati harus bersih dan mengandung niat baik sebelum kau mulai berbicara dan percakapanmu haruslah menyenangkan allah jika itu untuk duniawi dan pekerjaan yang sia sia maka apa pun yang kau nyatakan akan menjadi malapetaka bagimu itulah mengapa diam adalah yang terbaik dan apa pun yang kau katakan tentang tidur itu juga bernilai sekunder kebenaran darinya adalah hatimu harus terbebas dari permusuhan kecemburuan dan kebencian hatimu tidak boleh tamak akan dunia atau kekayaan di dalamnya dan ingatlah allah ketika akan tidur
347334 aku dengar bahwa engkau mempunyai karunia pengetahuan berikan atau juallah padaku
347335 aku tidak dapat menjualnya padamu karena engkau tidak mempunyai harganya aku tidak memberikan padamu karena yang akan kau miliki terlalu murah engkau harus membenamkan diri ke dalam air seperti aku supaya memperoleh mutiara
347336 engkau maju sebagai pedagang sekarang menjadi darwis jangan jadi apa pun selain mengemis
347337 bagi ummat manusia kau sekarang ini bukan apa apa biarkan mereka bukan apa apa bagimu dulu engkau adalah gubernur kembalilah sekarang ke propinsi itu dan cari setiap orang yang dulu kau tindas mintalah maaf pada mereka
347338 aku mengabdi kepada tuhan tidak untuk mendapatkan pahala apa pun jangan takut pada neraka jangan pula mendambakan surga aku akan menjadi abdi yang tidak baik jika pengabdianku untuk mendapatkan keuntungan materi aku berkewajiban mengabdi nya hanya untuk kasih sayang nya saja ya allah jika aku menyembah mu karena takut kepada neraka bakarlah aku di dalamnya jika aku menyembah mu karena mengharap surga campakkanlah aku darinya tetapi jika aku menyembah mu demi engkau semata janganlah engkau enggan memperlihatkan keindahan wajah mu yang abadi kepadaku
347339 aku mencintai mu dengan dua cinta cinta karena diriku dan cinta karena diri mu cinta karena diriku adalah keadaanku yang senantiasa mengingat mu cinta karena diri mu adalah keadaan mu yang mengungkapkan tabir sehingga engkau kulihat baik untuk ini maupun untuk itu pujianku bukanlah bagiku bagi mu lah pujian untuk semuanya buah hatiku hanya engkaulah yang kukasihi beri ampunlah pembuat dosa yang datang ke hadirat mu engkaulah harapanku kebahagiaanku dan kesenanganku hatiku enggan mencintai selain engkau
347340 harta yang sesungguhnya itu hanya didapat setelah menanggalkan segala yang bersifat duniawi ini dan aku melihat anda hanya mencarinya di dunia saja
347341 engkau tahu ya allah aku tak pernah meminta harta dunia dari mu sekalipun kau lah pencipta dunia ini lantas bagaimana aku menerima uang dari seseorang sedangkan uang itu sesungguhnya bukan kepunyaannya
347342 aku dengan segala ragaku mengabdi kepada allah swt aku berhubungan erat dengan nya aku disibukkan nya dengan hal hal lain daripada hal hal yang pada umumnya kalian rasakan
347343 sukma tenanglah kembalilah kepada tuhanmu legakan hatimu pada nya ini akan memberikan kepuasan kepada nya
347344 sebaik baik harta yang saleh adalah manakala harta itu ada di tangan seorang yang saleh
347345 tak ada kebaikan dalam dunia kecuali bagi orang yang begini dan begitu
347346 aku tidak butuh ilmunya para ulama sementara anda menyangka diri anda berilmu lalu bagaimana anda mengamalkan ilmu
347347 jikalau kalian tak pernah berbuat dosa niscaya yang paling saya takutkan pada kalian adalah yang lebih dahsyat lagi yaitu ujub kagum pada diri sendiri
347348 kalau begitu maksiat saja siapa tahu kita malah naik derajat
347349 dan carilah pada apa yang telah dianugerahkan allah kepadamu kebahagiaan negeri akhirat dan janganlah engkau lupakan bagianmu dari kenikmatan duniawi dan berbuat baiklah kepada orang lain sebagaimana allah telah berbuat baik kepadamu dan janganlah engkau berbuat kerusakan di bumk sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berbuat kerusakan
347350 ini merupakan hasil yang saya dapatkan ketika berdiskusi dengan al junayd bila saya pertanyaan ini diajukan kepada saya sebelum itu niscaya saya tidak akan dapat menjawabnya
347351 saya belajar hukurn pada ulama yang dikenal luas ilmunya tentang hadis seperti abu ubayd dan abu tsaur kemudian saya belajar pada ai muhasibi dan sari ibn mughallas itulah kunci keberhasilanku lantaran ilmu yang kita miliki harus terus dikontrol dan disesuaikan dengan al ouran dan sunnah oleh sebab itu siapa saja yang tidak menguasi ilmu al quran tidak secara formal belajar hadis dan tidak mendalami hukum sebelum menekuni tasawuf tidaklah berhak mengajarkan tasawuf
347352 sebelum ini kami belum pernah menemukan seorang syekh yang mampu menggabungkan ilmu pengetahuan dengan pengalaman sufistiknya banyak syekh memang memiliki ilmu yang luas tapi biasanya tidak mempunyai pengalaman mistik yang mendalam di sisi lain ada yang mempunyai pengalaman sufistik yang mendalam tapi hanya menguasai ilmu pengetahuan ala kadarnya al junayd memiliki keduanya pengalamannya mendalam di bidang sufisme dan ilmu pengetahuannya sangat luas bahkan ilmu pengetahuannya nyaris melebihi pengalaman mistiknya
347353 biarlah sekarang saya justru menjadi bebas dan tidak perlu lagi mengurus barang barang tersebut
347354 seorang sufi tidak seharusnya hanya berdiam diri di masjid dan berzikir saja tanpa bekerja untuk nafkahnya sehingga untuk menunjang kehidupannya orang tersebut menggantungkan diri hanya pada pemberian orang lain sifat sifat seperti itu sangatlah tercela karena sekali pun ia sufi ia harus tetap bekerja keras untuk menopang kehidupannya sehari hari dimana jika sudah mendapal nafkah diharapkan mau membelanjakannya di jatan allah
347355 aku takut kalau kalau rumah ini akan mengikat hatiku sehingga aku terganggu melaksanakan amal untuk akhirat
347356 pandanglah dunia ini sebagai sesuatu yang hina dan tak berharga itu adalah lebih baik bagimu
347357 demi allah aku tidak merasa sakit lantaran surga telah ditampakan bagiku sedangkan aku merindukannya dalam hati dan aku merasa bahwa tuhanku cemburu kepadaku lantas mencelaku
347358 wahai tuhanku tenggelamkanlah aku dalam mencintai mu sehingga tidak membimbangkan aku dari pada mu ya tuhan bintang di langit telah gemerlapan mata telah bertiduran pintu pintu istana telah dikunci dan tiap pencinta telah menyendiri dengan yang dicintainya dan inilah aku berada di hadirat mu tuhanku malam telah berlalu dan siang segera datang aku gelisah apakah amalanku engkau terima hingga aku merasa bahagia apakah engkau tolak sehingga aku merasa sedih demi kemahakuasaan mu inilah yang aku lakukan sehingga engkau beri hayat hidup sekiranya engkau usir aku dari hadapan mu aku tidak akan pergi karena cinta pada mu telah memenuhi hatiku
347359 buah hatiku hanya engkaulah yang aku kasihi beri ampunlah pembuat dosa yang datang kehadirat mu engkau harapanku kabahagian dan kesenanganku hatiku telah enggan mencintai selain dari engkau
347360 aku mencintai mu dengan dua cinta cinta karena diriku dan cinta karena diri mu cinta karena diriku ialah keadaanku senantiasa mengingat mu cinta karena diri mu adalah keadaan mu mengungkapkan tabir hingga engkau ku lihat baik untuk ini dan untuk itu pujian bukanlah bagiku dan bagi mu lah pujian untuk semuanya
347361 tuhanku jika kupuji engkau karena takut neraka mu bakarlah aku di dalamnya dan jika ku puji engkau karena mengharap surga mu jauhkanlah aku dari padanya tetapi bila ku puji engkau karena semata mata karena engkau maka jangan lah sembunyikan kecantikan mu yang kekal itu dari ku
347362 aku tidak tahu apa apa tentang pertanyaanmu itu masalah itu hanya diketahui oleh allah swt
347363 jika engkau seorang yang cerdas maka engkau jangan ke luar dengan tangan kosong
347364 sayang sekali berwuduklah dengan air kendi ini lalu masuklah ke kamar ini dan lakukan lah shalat dua rakaat maka engkau akan keluar membawa sesuatu
347365 aku mengetahui tuhan dengan tuhan dan sekiranya tidak karena tuhan aku tidak akan tahu tuhan

347386 the grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid no government program can alter that fact someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma tvs the price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them one way or another rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset based consumption dependent economy will be finally discredited

347427 a new report by the conservative rand corporation calls the so called war on terrorism fundamentally flawed doomed to failure the study pulls the rug from under john mccain who had promised not just more of the same old horse dung but perhaps another one hundred another 10 000 years of war against iraq saying that the us should re think the so called war on terrorism the report claims that bush failed to meet his own stated objectives it was the report concludes the wrong approach to begin with rand stopped short of repeating my charge the war on terror was just a cover for bushs assumption of dictatorial powers which he accomplished with the patriot act and numerous signing statements in effect his de facto rule by decree
347428 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
347429 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks

347433 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
347434 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
347435 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
347436 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
347437 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
347438 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
347439 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
347440 this shift was abrupt and took most manufacturers and dealers by surprise
347441 unknowing consumers most all of whom will also invest at a loss
347442 they will always have reputation management issues no matter what the brand is
347443 other authors have pockets of fans online but nothing to this extent

347445 die mehrheit der gro en lebensmittelhersteller hat in den vergangenen jahren deutliche fortschritte gemacht was die entwicklung von ges nderen produkten und die bewerbung einer ausgeglicheneren ern hrungsweise betrifft
347446 die marketingpraxis in diesem bereich l st bei mir einen stechenden schmerz in der magengegend aus
347447 aktuelle zahlen aus der kiggs studie belegen dass bergewicht und fettleibigkeit bei kindern und jugendlichen auch in deutschland zunehmend zu einem problem wird demnach waren im jahr 2006 rund 15 prozent der deutschen drei bis 17 j hrigen bergewichtig beziehungsweise adip s
347448 die entwicklungstendenz ist eindeutig die zahl der betroffenen kinder hat sich in den vergangenen zehn bis 20 jahren fast verdoppelt
347449 ein entsprechendes werbeverbot das die vermarktung von s en und stark fetthaltigen produkten an kinder und jugendliche untersagt gibt es in deutschland nicht man setzt in diesem zusammenhang auf die freiwillige selbstkontrolle der wirtschaft
347450 das modell der honorarberatung ist am transparentesten wenn es keine konkurrierenden interessen gibt ziehen kunde und berater am selben strang und gewinnen dabei beide denn geht es dem kunden gut geht es auch der bank gut
347451 diesen effekt sieht man h ufig bei neuen innovativen ideen weil man noch keine erfahrung damit hat die kosten einer f lschlichen ablehnung einer innovation sind geringer als jene einer f lschlichen annahme
347452 bei diesem modell ist die beste steuerbarkeit und transparenz gegeben

347454 es gibt zwei herbergen auf alten schiffen die im zentrum stockholms vor anker liegen und nun kommt noch der umgebaute jumbojet dazu
347455 wir haben uns das technikmuseum in speyer angesehen und uns beim dort ausgestellten lufthansa jumbo ein paar inspirationen f r unser hostel geholt
347456 das hostel soll mehr sein als nur eine blo e unterkunft daher werden wir auch ein kleines museum ber die geschichte der boeing 747 einrichten
347457 unser anliegen ist es die musikvideos die sonst von sehr viel glamour und blendwerk berh uft sind wieder so zu reduzieren dass der k nstler mit seiner musik brig bleibt
347458 man bekommt zu jedem k nstler auch ein st ck wien mit

347460 we did our research on the best way to enjoy the many choices at walt disney world
347461 but our basic rule is that wherever the kids want to go we go were on vacation so well take it easy and never rush
347462 keeping up with the kids is a bit challenging because they run faster than grandma
347463 with the big crowds and potential for headaches down time is really important
347464 take a long lunch a nap or a swim at noon but break up the day into manageable pieces
347465 our challenge is to stay together as a group and stay sane
347466 our plan is to stick together one day and split up the next so we can all have a breather
347467 its been hard to balance out what everyone wants to do
347468 by selling selected stations in these markets we can focus on the larger market stations many of which are showing growth
347469 we could potentially be in play as a cluster or station for sale
347470 but we dont know that we dont have a specific list
347471 credit is hard for everybody and there are a lot of radio stations out there for sale
347472 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
347473 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
347474 i was like why would he want to talk to me but the whole time he talked to me he talked about my son
347475 he was just talking to me a little bit about john calipari and the program and then he was telling me about the fedex forum and how he goes to a lot of games and sits on the floor
347476 i think in this case he was talking to an employee who is a longtime employee
347477 i dont think he did it with any intention of anything except to say hey im excited about you and your son there was no intention of anything else from what dave said to me so i think it was an innocent thing if you want to take a shot at me or our program you make a huge deal out of it but in reality youre talking about an innocent call from a boss to an employee
347478 i immediately knew it was a mistake because it was a check for 60 000
347479 but after a few phone calls i realized that there was no mistake
347480 you would think england and america would work well together
347481 were a very focused company in terms of our business one of the ways we try to find books is to establish what kinds of books would identify with the reader
347482 the role of women in the brazilian culture or economy has evolved
347483 if you think of the u s 20 years ago i think this is happening now in brazil in this case women rethink their role
347484 you have done well my son but look at the holes in the fence the fence will never be the same when you say things in anger they leave a scar just like this one you can put a knife in a man and draw it out it wont matter how many times you say im sorry the wound is still there
347485 espero que se reconsideren algunas partes de este fallo espero que haya una visi n m s ajustada a los hechos y que correspondan a las responsabilidades reales
347486 esto el fallo de la corte no fue bien recibido por la poblaci n por el pa s en general y menos por el gobierno
347487 espero que haya una reconsideraci n de algunos puntos de este fallo
347488 well there is no comparison the mummy 1999 kicks the mummy 1932 in the ass
347489 yeah but thats only because it had tons of special effects tons of action a lot of jokes and rachael weisz
347490 yeah but um the mummy 1932 had zita johan wearing almost nothing and boris karloff
347491 im sorry if my staring at you has made you feel uncomfortable its just that you look just like my son who just died recently
347492 as im leaving can you say goodbye mother it would make me feel much better
347493 at a time when weve got bigger challenges than any time in our history and youre running ads with hillary and er with britney and ah paris in it i mean come on the american people deserve better
347494 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
347495 polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their on increasingly overpacked airplanes
347496 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
347497 competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people
347498 the scalamobil is a portable stair climbing and power unit that
347499 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
347500 man is not born to solve the problems of the universe but to find out what he has to do
347501 and theyre going to get opportunities and well see so far it has been looking great
347502 this offense as long as i can remember has been real heavy throwing to the backs
347503 the acquired intellectual property facilities and product lines are complementary to enablences current operations in its optical components and subsystems division this acquisition will provide an immediate revenue stream and an opportunity to cross sell these dupont photonics products to our worldwide customer base
347504 enablence was the best fit for the technology developed at dupont photonics given that enablence is emerging as a leader in the plc space the acquisition will permit dupont photonics customers to be serviced by a company that has a proven track record of delivering advanced photonic components in access metro and long haul communication markets
347505 i have a plethora of books on shelves i do believe i will now be referencing karen goellers fitness programs more than any other im inspired
347506 thats a possibility but it would certainly need a lot of consultation with those local governments and also the local business groups and also the people who work in those areas
347507 its just a matter of prioritising and trying to work through all of the different traffic agendas that were trying to deal with but this is clearly something that has to be done as soon as possible
347508 pulling a larger line first is always better than pulling a small line that cant extinguish the fire
347509 i asked my son which cereal he wanted lucky charms or meerkat poop he says i want the poop one and thats why im totally mother of the year
347510 has accomplished a great deal for the program during his 14 seasons and continues to have my support as an outstanding leader
347511 we had a good discussion of the issues surrounding a small percentage of african americans playing in all of college baseball and our baseball program i continue to have great admiration for him as a quality young man
347512 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally
347513 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability
347514 however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
347515 we look forward to working with government to discuss the transitional rebate arrangements until the gross feed in tariff policy is in place
347516 the new lifepics solution is a wonderful addition to our products and services offering
347517 the transition to lifepics has been seamless and lifepics expanded offering of fun and creative photo products is certain to appeal to our customers
347518 shoprite is one of the most reputable grocery businesses in the country and we are thrilled to partner with them in their online imaging service
347519 our solution facilitates order volume growth by establishing a personal connection between shoprite stores and consumers providing a wide range of products and offering convenient order fulfillment options shoprite is dedicated to excellent customer service and product value and with the lifepics online imaging solution in place they are poised to become one of the leading photofinishers on the east coast
347520 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
347521 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
347522 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
347523 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
347524 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
347525 some industry sources believe mr garrett will soon announce the government will increase the means test on the solar panel rebate program from 100 000 to 150 000
347526 but this would still be a bad result for australias solar industry and for home owners wanting to install solar panels
347527 it still makes it harder for many people who want to install solar in their homes it would still treat the rebate as welfare not a positive incentive to boost the renewable sector in australia
347528 lol i suspected that people would have a problem with the segmenmt apperntly spending thousands on technology is no problem but spending a few hundreds on fashion is a huge problem gt
347529 i think aots is now trying to appeal to the nu geek a pretty
347530 i didnt even watch e3 on g4 but at least i do know about ff vii
347531 its more about the r amp r than the gambling
347532 i only drink beer on days that end in y
347533 when you look back at las vegas people said the same thing
347534 were going to play another song for you now because were not qualified to do anything else
347535 thank you for not making this a blockbuster night thanks for tearing yourself away from the computer
347536 coming out and standing around with other human beings thats what its all about
347537 we are expecting this year to be another great art in the park
347538 we have over 75 new and returning artists scheduled to spend the day at preservation plaza the public will once again experience a wide variety of art at this years event with local and regional artists specializing in ceramics jewelry painting metalwork glass and photography just to name a few
347539 we had a great response from the artists and the public last year when art in the park was held during the okoboji blues festival and we were fortunate enough to schedule it again with this musical event
347540 i loved the combination it gave preservation plaza a festive atmosphere there will also be performances throughout the afternoon by mission theatre company there should be something for everyone at this years event
347541 i think audiences will really enjoy it because of the way its being put together
347542 the way the actors are working on it allows it to be understandable a lot of times people are afraid of the shakespeare language this production is meant to be an opportunity an introduction to shakespeare because people are intimidated by it and they dont need to be
347543 hey how about when goku used that blue beam to counter vegetas purple beam
347544 groundhog day is coming lets put out a coupon for that the more shadow the higher the discount
347545 she just goes and you have to really hold onto her
347546 you can be paying attention to one kid who needs to go potty or tie their shoe anything and the other one can go so fast
347547 the girls think its a fun new thing theyre putting on
347548 if they find your child who is lost they simply call the number thats on the temporary on your childs arm
347549 our goal is that no one ever has to actually use the phone number on the childs arm but its for me such a great peace of mind knowing if something happens thats right there
347550 we have secured or are in the process of closing over 34 million in financing to help fund our effort to provide broadband and voice services to underserved rural markets in the united states
347551 we tested and compared voxs voip services against the competition and concluded that vox is the best wholesale voip provider in the industry in terms of voice quality provisioning and overall value
347552 we are proud to have charles street partners as one of our wholesale customers they are an excellent testimonial of how our superior voip services are able to cover the largest markets in the united states as well as the underserved rural areas our unique voip technology coupled with high profile service providers like csp enables us to strengthen our presence in the larger metropolitan markets while simultaneously enabling us to gain first mover advantage in some of the most underserved rural markets in the country
347553 im trying to contact the district police officer about the registration of the criminal case
347554 they have not yet registered the case it is the duty of the dpo to register the case but hes failing to perform his duty so im trying to contact him or else ill take it to the high court
347555 being weaker and belonging to the christian community the girls were kidnapped
347556 the kidnapping of my daughters has made me feel insecure in the country
347557 my muslim countrymen think we christians are not human beings they think we do not have dignity
347558 christianity came to west papua more than 100 years ago and most papuans eagerly adopted it to the point that christianity reinforces and now underlines their identity
347559 where papuan culture appears to be in the process of being eroded christianity serves to maintain local values and provide papuans with a strong sense of who they are
347560 the report forecasts that if muslim versus christian clashes do erupt they will remain localized
347561 i do not agree with that assessment the jihadist groups the pro indonesian militias and in particular the indonesian military are looking for an excuse to unleash violent repression and ethnic religious cleansing any clash therefore has incendiary potential
347562 papua is part of indonesia and christians need to live alongside muslims in a harmonious society the alternative is horrific and the malukus bear witness to this
347563 please do not worry because the paying guest accommodation was our target and no student was harmed
347564 we are committed to the safety of any student in the hills it is our partys responsibility and no danger will come to them
347565 the students were not specific targets but the mob had targetted deepak gurungs gnlf leader house and the students were allowed to come out peacefully
347566 wed like to say that the safety of bhutanese students will be given utmost importance
347567 there is an increase in deaths of mexicans on the northern border
347568 every minute a mexican abandons his community and every minute a family disintegrates
347569 japanese consumption was already a threat to bluefin tuna in the mediterranean the european craze for sushi bars has added to that
347570 if the chinese market continues to grow that will be the end of the stock
347571 around 80 to 85 percent of bluefin tuna caught in the mediterranean is exported to japan
347572 this stock has now collapsed thanks to over fishing and the japanese turned their attention to the atlantic bluefin tuna
347573 the bluefin tuna industry is in the process of fishing itself to death
347574 we want a clear definition of the budget because there is no definition in the constitution
347575 by the current look of things we may land up in court which will then have to interpret the budget clauses for us
347576 one major problem here however is the lack of any supreme court which is the final interpreter of the constitution but still the high court is an option
347577 i am no more the chairman of the drafting committee so i cannot be there in the assembly under the separation of powers to give my opinion and i can give it only to his majesty if asked under article 21 section 8
347578 theres nothing in the constitution or the nc act that makes the recommendations of nc binding on the budget passed by na
347579 there is a very clear intent of weakening the national council i think that the national assembly feels it would be better off without the house of review
347580 even if the budget is called a bill it makes no difference because the budget has a separate clause for it apart from ordinary bills
347581 we shall be forever grateful to them and we now translate that gratitude into a scholarship program for the spouse and the children they left behind
347582 through the program we hope to repay the heroism of bureaucracys unsung heroes by helping provide for their families particularly schooling for a better future
347583 if the slain public servant has no family the program can be availed of by his or her siblings
347584 over the next week several hundred athletes from almost a dozen countries will fly the a380 to beijing to compete in the games
347585 sen clinton has long been a supporter of emilys list and encouraging women to run for congress
347586 this is going to be a great year from women we have a fantastic class of women running for congress senate and the governors office including in your great state of colorado
347587 in buddhism we believe that all animals were our parents or children in one life or the other
347588 going into my senior year i knew that holding would come into big play
347589 it would definitely help my chances at the next level
347590 derrick is in the middle of the pack in punting in this league
347591 hes not a bad punter and hes not one of the elite guys i think he can do better he had an off year he would admit that as well hes had slumps in the past that hes come out of this particular year he didnt really come out of it that generated this competition
347592 its been hard to just kind of relax and let things unfold
347593 i dont feel right now that im hitting the ball as well as i should be but ive had plenty of bad weeks of practice and plenty of good games following it so im not real concerned
347594 i dont think of it as pressure but i think of it as showing them that i definitely have the ability
347595 theyre expecting a lot out of me its a great motivator for me
347596 were going to lay it on the table and match those numbers up
347597 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
347598 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
347599 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
347600 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
347601 he may not like it public speaking so much but he is really good at it
347602 he has good things to say and people want to hear what he has to say
347603 all i can say is that i am glad to be here and its really a privilege
347604 one of the rare qualities you seen in a coach is to be able to relate to players as they see things their way
347605 emmitt could get to their level he was very good communicating with them
347606 he was one of the few players i had who once in a while would point out things i was doing wrong
347607 first of all i was surprised coach gibbs came back and after saturday im going to do the same
347608 if a coach can come back and coach i should be able to come back and play
347609 he kraft has never gotten a chance to enshrine someone in canton and i think it may not be too long before he gets a chance to come to canton and be inducted as a contributor
347610 i thought it would be good for him to come here and do some work
347611 he is not a retard why do you say that
347612 that doesnt make him a retard you are a little brat
347613 ya i will keep walking but you should teach your kid some manners
347614 well if those are manners he has a lot to learn
347615 he has nothing to learn you just cant handle the truth
347616 2008 twenty years later with some young guns listening and perhaps having them imagine the way i once did when i was in my twenties and if that happens i dont know will i cry or will i laugh
347617 all this happened because of loose credit in the market
347618 monetary tools will have little impact because we import our consumption goods from india
347619 when things become expensive businessmen simply increase their prices and the salaried somehow muddle through
347620 it is us the farmers who suffer the most from rising prices fertilizers and essentials become dearer and our source of income farming is the same as before
347621 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
347622 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by two tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
347623 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
347624 the cause of concern is that he former druk air managing director sangay tenzin is the pms maro sister in laws husband but if he was appointed in the best interests of the nation then so be it
347625 i was very concerned and went through the position classification system pcs and bhutan civil service rules bcsr the principles of equity and justice equal opportunities and merit were violated
347626 anybody with qualifications or experience should be given the opportunity to serve the country
347627 firstly robbie coming in and the new coaching staff there was a time of getting to understand each other
347628 now we know exactly what we are trying to achieve we have been improving
347629 the mindset is to bring everything you can to the performance and thats what everyone has been doing whether they have been playing for 50 test matches or their first few test matches
347630 guys have been bringing whatever they can to the performance of the team thats the mindset if you do that hopefully that will contribute to a positive result
347631 and whats been really good about this group is we are pretty tight weve been spending a lot of time with each other
347632 that was a real grind and i suspect this weekend could be that it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
347633 whats in the future who knows a week is a long time in this game but weve got a great opportunity this weekend
347634 it will be good to see this group thrive weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it will be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
347635 pdp was in a desperate situation and needed the fund more than dpt
347636 the general secretary of dpt had been calling the pdp secretary saying that he is under considerable pressure from the prime minister to submit the joint proposal to the government to help the two parties with financial assistance
347637 the secretary general and the finance officer did visit the dpt office but it was only to sign the letter which was drafted by dpt
347638 i told lam that id talk to lyonchhen on how the parties could be helped financially
347639 after speaking with lyonchhen he suggested that we submit a joint proposal to the cabinet and i conveyed the message to the pdp general secretary
347640 we also had a meeting before that and on june 4 the dpt office faxed a draft of the joint proposal and asked me to give my comments by 10 00 am the following day
347641 yes i admit that the prime minister was right i did change my stand based on my interpretation of the constitution
347642 their response was unequivocal in that the proposal of state funding was unconstitutional no matter how open for interpretation the clause in the constitution is i cant interpret it in my favour
347643 it doesnt matter who prepared it actually the bottom line is that both the parties felt necessary to approach the government
347644 to be accused of initiating was wrong and lets agree that it was both the parties
347645 were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far
347646 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
347647 polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their on increasingly overpacked airplanes
347648 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
347649 while you might think gamers purchase fewer movie discs that others we didnt see any significant evidence of that in our results
347650 ps3 console shipments will go a long way to help bring down manufacturing costs and drive down blu ray player prices
347651 you know where you are going and i wish i knew where i were going and i wish you would stop and tell me if this is right
347652 im going that way follow me and when i turn right at the light you turn left
347653 originally they had nicknames i cant remember them but they had nicknames
347654 the one who was supposed to be the last one we called red after a stoplight
347655 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
347656 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
347657 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
347658 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
347659 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
347660 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
347661 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
347662 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
347663 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
347664 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered

347670 i worked with him in 2006 at the pne and last summer at the pne
347671 i didnt know who it was i was disgusted to hear that and then this morning to know that it was somebody that i worked with and it was somebody that i was close with i was really sick to my stomach
347672 he was always smiling he loved little kids and he would always get the attention from of course all the girls
347673 if i was in a bad mood and didnt get much sleep because we worked long hours he would just walk up and brighten the mood every day
347674 to take away that life youre taking away a little bit of everybodys life
347675 i finally won the year long battle with the ea registration process
347676 all members of parliament are not of the same opinion about accountability with the transitional federal government
347677 there are many members of parliament who oppose accountability so the government can manage as it likes
347678 said the decision to secede was taken at a meeting held in yenagoa bayelsa state on july 2 2006
347679 because such action would spell dire consequences both for the soldiers and the government
347680 now that the secretary general of the united nations mr
347681 that our peaceful social economic historical and ancestral ties with the rest of the people of the niger delta leave us not only with no other frontier but with no other option than to join forces with the valiant and heroic freedom fighters of the niger delta
347682 that bamosd by this declaration is subsuming all its activities on the bakassi peninsula into the larger war of liberation of the nigeria delta under the joint leadership of the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend and other joints commands for the protection defence and security of its people and resources
347683 as major stakeholders in the area we have a joint responsibility to ensure that we take a leading role in the establishment of structures and a force to safeguard our people and resources towards a collective security of the gulf of guinea
347684 we must work closely together at the mixed commission on agreements that need to be signed and implemented in the aftermath of the august 14 handover
347685 this day gathered that the militants are planning another invasion of key areas of the peninsula and are already on the high seas with 11 boats in preparation for the attack
347686 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly

347688 you have to take in a substantial amount of faeces about one gram to be able to get hepatitis e
347689 i dont think anyone intends to eat faeces but because of poor hygiene they end up consuming food with faeces
347690 the main thrust of the accelerated response will be to break the transmission chain at individual and household levels where the problem originates
347691 the accelerated response will also reinforce case management through provision of medicines and supplies and increase the number of qualified health workers in some health facilities
347692 the ministry of health should send film vans to carry out sensitisation because much as we are blaming the local leaders for not doing enough to sensitise the people the people at the centre have also not done much
347693 we need these technical people to tell us what interventions they have put in place
347694 we are committed to supporting the government to prevent and control this outbreak in this regard we are supporting training of village health teams
347695 the deadline passed and i thought wow all that and nothing
347696 and then a half hour after the deadline passed i get called into the managers office and they say youve been traded if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to than boston i dont think
347697 its tough to all of a sudden have it click that youve been submersed in the middle of a pennant race and you have a chance to win a ring i dont think its going to resonate that quick i think that i might need a day or two to let it sink in but i fully intend to let it sink in
347698 i just thought of it as they need a left fielder regardless of what happened before i got here im going to play left field here and i cant wait
347699 hes going to hit for a pretty good average and hes going to play great defence for you hes going to be a fun player to watch
347700 if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats
347701 if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got
347702 i saw him be banged up in 06 thinking no way is he playing tonight he played every night he never talked about anything if his knee was bothering him he just went out there and played and never made an excuse for anything thats the bottom line this guy is a gamer
347703 not only would going fully metric cost a fortune to implement in britain it would also not go down well with a majority of the motoring public
347704 it does seem odd that we buy our fuel in litres but think about fuel efficiency in miles per gallon we appear to be an imperial metric nation
347705 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk this is something the military understands but the british public does not
347706 interstate 70 and u s 22 could play a vital role if we would need to evacuate people in the ohio valley
347707 right now with the tunnel closed this really hits home
347708 there are many things we need to be cognizant of such as if there is maintenance or construction happening on a highway what do we do then
347709 should there be any type of disaster in the eastern united states interstate 70 u s 22 as well u s route 30 would become the primary evacuation routes for our major cities including new york and washington d c therefore i believe it is imperative that public safety officials from surrounding states be provided an opportunity to see and understand all the strengths and challenges the panhandle offers and i want to ensure that the northern panhandle is included in the strategic planning
347710 weve learned from disasters like hurricane katrina that if you are better organized you can better help people
347711 if you have to get off and everybody goes into downtown wheeling it can be a problem
347712 there could be shortages in places to stay and food all the things that happened after katrina

347721 bei einer kieferfehlstellung wird die knorpelscheibe zwischen den gelenkknochen zusammengedr ckt oder sogar perforiert im schlimmsten fall reibt dann knochen auf knochen
347722 die patientinnen sind h ufig schon lange in rztlicher behandlung und nehmen psychopharmaka als dauermedikation ein
347723 jedoch vermutet fast niemand dass die ursache im kiefergelenk liegen k nnte

347728 wir haben uns das technikmuseum in speyer angesehen und uns beim dort ausgestellten lufthansa jumbo ein paar inspirationen f r unser hostel geholt
347729 das hostel soll mehr sein als nur eine blo e unterkunft daher werden wir auch ein kleines museum ber die geschichte der boeing 747 einrichten
347730 die mehrheit der gro en lebensmittelhersteller hat in den vergangenen jahren deutliche fortschritte gemacht was die entwicklung von ges nderen produkten und die bewerbung einer ausgeglicheneren ern hrungsweise betrifft
347731 die marketingpraxis in diesem bereich l st bei mir einen stechenden schmerz in der magengegend aus
347732 aktuelle zahlen aus der kiggs studie belegen dass bergewicht und fettleibigkeit bei kindern und jugendlichen auch in deutschland zunehmend zu einem problem wird demnach waren im jahr 2006 rund 15 prozent der deutschen drei bis 17 j hrigen bergewichtig beziehungsweise adip s
347733 die entwicklungstendenz ist eindeutig die zahl der betroffenen kinder hat sich in den vergangenen zehn bis 20 jahren fast verdoppelt
347734 ein entsprechendes werbeverbot das die vermarktung von s en und stark fetthaltigen produkten an kinder und jugendliche untersagt gibt es in deutschland nicht man setzt in diesem zusammenhang auf die freiwillige selbstkontrolle der wirtschaft
347735 das modell der honorarberatung ist am transparentesten wenn es keine konkurrierenden interessen gibt ziehen kunde und berater am selben strang und gewinnen dabei beide denn geht es dem kunden gut geht es auch der bank gut

347748 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
347749 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
347750 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
347751 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
347752 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
347753 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
347754 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
347755 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
347756 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
347757 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
347758 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
347759 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
347760 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
347761 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
347762 he really showed up in practice and was consistently making plays on us
347763 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
347764 i target a handful of players that are in very competitive situations to make the roster
347765 in fairness you have to let those guys show and the scrimmage is actually the best place because the coaches arent there its like a game and we see how theyve processed what weve done so far without help
347766 but it was a great growing experience because going through adversity is either kind of a make or break situation it makes you stronger it makes you tougher it forces you to adapt and adjust and survive
347767 that is what i needed to do last year to get used to it
347768 we know that theres a couple spots there and were just trying to do the best we can to show the coaches hey you can rely on us to play
347769 were excited about the opportunity to go out there and make plays
347770 im just feeling a lot more confident in myself and i believe in myself a lot more and i know so much more about the game
347771 so compared to last year its like wow look how much ive improved
347772 when we decide whos going to play and how many snaps and all that stuff its never quite fair
347773 but we try to pinpoint certain areas certain players that we need to have more information on
347774 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
347775 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
347776 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
347777 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
347778 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
347779 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
347780 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
347781 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
347782 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
347783 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
347784 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
347785 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
347786 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
347787 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
347788 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
347789 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
347790 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
347791 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
347792 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
347793 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
347794 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
347795 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
347796 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
347797 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
347798 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
347799 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
347800 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
347801 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
347802 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
347803 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
347804 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
347805 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
347806 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
347807 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
347808 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
347809 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
347810 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
347811 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
347812 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
347813 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
347814 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
347815 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
347816 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
347817 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
347818 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
347819 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
347820 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
347821 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
347822 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
347823 he was so excited and so was john linden about going out to oshkosh he spent months getting ready to go and he bought this plane about a year and a half ago in oregon
347824 im just so very puzzled as to what could have happened because they were such good pilots
347825 these guys honestly were the nicest two men you could ever meet and they were the most careful men you could ever meet
347826 there was no failure of the aircraft all pieces were there it was nothing more than a stall spin which happens in landing situations when the pilots attention is diverted
347827 this gentleman ended up letting the plane get too slow
347828 what happened here is a classic example of individuals who come to oshkosh
347829 theyre so interested in getting here that they have no experience in going into a high traffic volume area theres a natural amount of apprehension and fear
347830 it was always his dream to fly my husband was a good pilot in fact he has a plane of his own which is still housed at the hangar
347831 roger was an excellent pilot very conscientious particular about keeping his airplane up to spec
347832 one builder told me its my butt 3 000 feet above the ground doing 150 miles an hour
347833 my husband was a perfectionist about everything he did and the only thing i can say is that at least he passed away doing something he loved
347834 in fighting or threatening or in violent or tumultuous behavior
347835 this is just a preliminary motion early in the case
347836 every available defense is still available to us the case is just starting
347837 the interchange with the missing ramps created a unique situation
347838 people from new york going to the airport can drive the entire distance on interstates but when they get here they have to drive through a business district
347839 friend of mine came in and threw a cd on my desk
347840 and it must of sat there for a month and a half and finally one day i just happened to throw it in and soon as i hit play i was just kind of blown away i heard this guys voice and the songs and i said ive got to meet this guy some day
347841 i got a phone message saying that scott weiland from
347842 and they were looking for somebody to fill in for him that night
347843 we both had a break from our tours had ten days off
347844 so i said why dont you come up here its beautiful its summertime do some jet skiing and some hiking play some music and have some fun so here we are
347845 im just hoping some of this can be cleaned up
347846 motorists should allow extra time when traveling on the inbound parkway north
347847 on that ridge theres a huge concern with wildlife bears coyotes snakes and an occasional aggravated deer
347848 il faut faire payer les pauvres ils sont beaucoup plus nombreux
347849 quelle assurance dans vos propos quelle aisance pour critiquer votre propore bilan
347850 the grossmont union high school district went on record yesterday supporting a november initiative that would ban same sex marriage in california the board voted 4 0 to pass a resolution endorsing proposition 8 which would amend the state constitution to recognize marriage only between a man and a woman
347851 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
347852 how can rivera be so unhittable in save situations but inconsistent in non save situations
347853 the truth is i cannot simply walk away and leave william to be destroyed by this man
347854 we know he is a charlatan and my son has been taken in
347855 if i could talk to william i believe i could get him back but we are never allowed to be alone with him
347856 we have seen our son change from a bright enthusiastic confident young man devoted to his family to a hostile closed down brainwashed zombie
347857 whenever i phone william on his mobile edo answers and says hes busy we are not allowed to visit
347858 occasionally i get through to william but he often says how did you get this number dont call here again
347859 its just unbelievable but weve consulted a cult expert and much of it is a recognised form of brainwashing
347860 it was a difficult but i hoped it would bring him some comfort
347861 i wrote always remember i am your mum and that my love for you is unlimited and unconditional
347862 he was captain of the school football team he swam for the local swimming team he was a soloist in the choir academically he was great he got four a levels and a place at durham university we were thrilled for him and so proud
347863 he was going to this place called plum village to think about his life we didnt think it that unusual as he was always a curious young man who had an appetite to try new things
347864 i wonder now if he was just ripe for the picking
347865 he was brought up catholic we werent an overly religious family but he was spiritually curious and i think he was looking for something when he met edo
347866 we all felt sorry for edo because he told us he had cancer
347867 hed had a terrible life he said too that hed lost his parents wife and children in a car accident
347868 at first he seemed everything youd expect from a buddhist monk he wore long brown robes and constantly stroked beads around his neck
347869 he said that he would politely accept whatever food was put in front of him
347870 but he smoked quite heavily too and was very fond of gin wine and guinness this struck me as odd for someone so supposedly spiritual
347871 odder still was that he managed to eat with such gusto when he supposedly had throat cancer
347872 another weird thing was his accent he spoke with this odd foreign accent even though he is scottish i guess it made him more authentic
347873 he got this caravan for a few hundred pounds but it wasnt good enough for edo so the next thing we knew william was paying for a bedsit for him
347874 we were a bit worried but william is very generous so we didnt make a big deal about it
347875 he kept talking about what an amazingly good person edo was how money didnt matter to him how sound his values were he claimed he had become enlightened by him but when i asked what he meant he couldnt tell me
347876 once he even said edo could make himself disappear he was already under edos spell
347877 he claimed to be a surgeon and a psychiatrist and to have worked extensively in war torn countries for medicines sans frontieres but when i asked him about his time in iran where i have been twice he clearly had never been there
347878 he said he had studied at yale and cambridge and had written 32 books but it didnt stand up to the mildest scrutiny he couldnt tell us what the books were or what college he was at at cambridge
347879 by then we were convinced edo was just after williams money and told him so
347880 he wouldnt hear of it every time we tried to talk to him he would just sit down and leave us or go into some sort of weird trance it was scary
347881 by this time he had lost loads of weight about two stone and he was always too busy to sleep
347882 bill and i started to look on cult awareness websites and were horrified to find out that food and sleep deprivation are known tactics for recruitment into cults
347883 it weakens them and makes them more susceptible to brainwashing with every day that passed came more evidence that something sinister was going on
347884 william started saying things like im so enlightened that even the flowers smile at me
347885 we wondered if he was on drugs but i think its more likely that he was just hypnotised by this man
347886 helen had a breakdown she was devastated she couldnt convince him that edo was anything other than genuine
347887 the next thing we knew edo had moved in with william from there it all went downhill
347888 the court asked if william had capacity issues in other words is he all there
347889 i said no he has been brainwashed i even tried to get him sectioned under the mental health act but our gp said william would have to agree to be examined which he wouldnt
347890 one of his ex wives said that penny was evil and that the mere mention of his name made her shudder with fear
347891 we also spoke to his sister suzanne richardson who hadnt seen edo for more than 20 years she said her mother was still alive so the car crash he talked about was clearly a lie
347892 it was rubbish of course but it shows what sort of a man we are dealing with
347893 he will do anything to turn our son against us
347894 we went out for lunch edo insisted on coming too
347895 as the day wore on i felt william was becoming more like his old self more chatty less weird and distracted but edo was visibly furious
347896 just as i started to talk to william about his future
347897 edo became ill and asked william to go to the loo with him when they came back he was different blank like a robot
347898 he used to have such a wicked sense of humour but now he is so serious he looks so unhappy he has just cut himself off
347899 none of his siblings or friends can get through to him either my daughter missed him terribly at her wedding this year she broke down at the altar because of it
347900 this woman described william my clever son as being lovely but a bit simple like someone with learning difficulties
347901 she said he shuffled rather than walked and that she thought there was something seriously wrong with him
347902 i worry that edo keeps him so exhausted with tasks that he cant even think for himself
347903 it beggars belief we have seen our intelligent young son suspend all reasoning and end up a brainwashed zombie
347904 surely he cant be given the chance to wreck other young lives too
347905 the last time i saw william before the court case he tried to hypnotise me he kept saying look into my eyes i snapped back as i used to do when he was three and being naughty just stop that william and he did
347906 that gives me hope he is still my boy i can still get through to him on some level now i just have to get through on a deeper level and stop him throwing his life away
347907 as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion
347908 to cause at a distance instant death of us officials
347909 statements from people at the boat ramp said there had not been anyone else at the ramp for hours
347910 dropped his head down and said he had made a big mistake
347911 ever take a trip down memory lane and stay just a little too long
347912 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
347913 we need to identify these people and weed them out
347914 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
347915 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
347916 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
347917 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
347918 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
347919 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action
347920 when they get a policy directive they have certain room for manoeuvre keeping the interests of the state in view
347921 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
347922 the clients have their own agenda and room for manoeuvre its a very very murky relationship and the attacks in pakistan show that many operators have gone rogue
347923 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organization on pakistani soil
347924 but the general assumption in washington is that a mixed and unreliable ally is better than no ally at all

347930 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not

347933 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
347934 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
347935 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
347936 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
347937 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
347938 the scientific community is really going to run with this
347939 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
347940 it seems we all agree that if the action was taken to facilitate the surface mine it would be covered
347941 but the statute is broader it says if the activity on the land is in connection with a surface coal mine
347942 obviously if youre going to take the mountainside off you have to take off whats on the mountainside
347943 the removal of material overlying a coal seam prior to the excavation of the coal seam is surface mining activity
347944 it is prohibited under the general fundamental principle of the surface mining act which is that no one conduct any mining activity without a valid permit
347945 the inspectors are on mine sites every day 300 days out of the year
347946 thats the appropriate place for this determination to be made
347947 the factual investigation did not find this to be surface coal mining activity
347948 its of very grave concern to have this kind of activity above a home thats inhabited its frightening
347949 the coal mining act was passed by congress only for coal mining not for all environmental ills
347950 i think its very clear to people in wise county
347951 when we see massive clear cutting we know that strip mining is going to follow
347952 theres the possibility that could make it a permanent stop which leads us into the permit itself
347953 rush hour how states can reduce traffic congestion through performance based transportation programs

347956 we feel like its an opportunity to showcase our skills and show all the uk fans and the basketball fans out there that we can have a basketball team here in the uk and that were pretty good
347957 the mps will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
347958 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and have been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign and commonwealth office
347959 the government said that by 2006 most people would have been educated in the metric system and the sea change would come from there but this shows it hasnt happened
347960 not only would going fully metric cost a fortune to implement in britain it would also not go down well with a majority of the motoring public
347961 as a result of keeping an eye on increasing prices motorists now seem to understand the fuel price in litres
347962 it does seem odd that we buy our fuel in litres and think about fuel efficiency in miles per gallon we appear to be an imperia metric nation
347963 on going ito for two months at tina target natin 50 000 na pirma dito at sa mga kababayan natin sa abroad this will go on for two months and were targeting 50 000 signatures locally and from our countrymen abroad
347964 the government directly benefits from the remittances of ofws through taxes such as the 0 15 documentary stamp tax collected in every transaction for every billion dollars remitted monthly the government earns 1 5m or p62m this is aside from other fees charged to the ofws before leaving the country
347965 banks and private business also rake in gargantuan profits for every 200 remittance sent monthly 15 22 is charged as service fee for 10 million ofws sending remittances banks earn a staggering 1b every month
347966 thousands of ofws experience oppressive working conditions and human rights abuses abroad thousands are stranded in different countries and many are in death row while proclaiming them as bagong bayanis new heroes the arroyo government continues to neglect the plight of ofws
347967 in fact they have to tighten their belts abroad so that they do not need to lessen the 200 they send to their families at home but due to skyrocketing prices in the philippines this amount is simply not enough
347968 to remove the documentary stamp tax from remittances of ofws to give them greater purchasing power amid this time of skyrocketing prices of food and transport
347969 at present for every remittance an ofw makes a dst of 0 15 is collected by the government to some the imposition may be minuscule and insignificant but to ofws and their families such imposition becomes another financial burden
347970 increased significantly with chicken already at p120 per kilo beef brisket at p180 per kilo pork liempo at p170 per kilo and bangus and tilapia at p80 p90 per kilo all of which have increased by an average of p10 compared to the prices in 2007
347971 every peso saved can make a big difference for the average filipino family removing the dst from ofw remittances can enable the families of overseas workers to buy additional food or save this amount for other purposes
347972 ironically a weaker dollar has also led to less purchasing power of ofws money when their earnings are spent locally
347973 as if high prices of oil and rice were not enough even the currency that our ofws earn in has diminished in value we need to give these new heroes the support that they need and deserve understanding their great contribution to our economy

348089 sepertinya aku telah kehilangan kemampuan dan kekuatanku bagaimana aku dapat mempertanggungjawab kan hasil kerjaku kepada majikan
348090 mengasah kapak saya tidak punya waktu untuk itu saya sangat sibuk setiap hari menebang pohon dari pagi hingga sore dengan sekuat tenaga
348091 nah disinilah masalahnya ingat hari pertama kamu kerja dengan kapak baru dan terasah maka kamu bisa menebang pohon dengan hasil luar biasa hari hari berikutnya dengan tenaga yang sama menggunakan kapak yang sama tetapi tidak diasah kamu tahu sendiri hasilnya semakin menurun maka sesibuk apapun kamu harus meluangkan waktu untuk mengasah kapakmu agar setiap hari bekerja dengan tenaga yang sama dan hasil yang maksimal sekarang mulailah mengasah kapakmu dan segera kembali bekerja

348099 well my birthday is coming up and not sure what im going to do
348100 welcome to wordpress com this is your first post edit or delete it and start blogging
348101 i am sooooo tired my husband didnt get home until five this morning he was called over to harold and ernestines at midnight
348102 well my husband had to go to the jail this afternoon
348103 i want you to meet barb shes the one who wrote the letter to us
348104 the kids up at the vassar schools have a parade on halloween
348105 ummm youve got it all wrong do it this way
348106 i believe working with the primaries is the best way i can use the gifts god has given me my husband and i have talked this over and he agrees
348107 well make her step down and have your wife take her place and well say that the pastors wife should be able to have whatever ministry she wants
348108 the reason we did that was not to have an annual ball but having said that when we actually had the ball we realized people were very taken by the idea of having a veterans ball
348109 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it
348110 a lot of people enjoyed it and the board decided to make it an annual event
348111 were hoping to make the event a bit bigger this year
348112 they all benefit from what the foundation can give to us
348113 the nadir of the night was the next act ben heresey which were three guys who ran onstage chanting
348114 the communication effectiveness of system models using the uml versus structured techniques a field experiment
348115 sit next to a pretty girl for a minute put your hand in boiling water for a minute thats relativity
348116 the ecuadorian people do not want foreign troops on our soil and the government has to follow the mandate of its people
348117 we have spent more than 150 million on troops to monitor the border with colombia and will continue to support anti narcotics operations in our country
348118 the operations there are critical to our overall counternarcotics strategy but ecuador has promised continued close cooperation to confront the threat of drug smuggling
348119 we note however that the closure will leave a serious gap in efforts by the united states and our partners to confront illegal drug trafficking throughout the region
348120 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
348121 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
348122 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
348123 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
348124 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
348125 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
348126 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
348127 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
348128 there is a real possibility of some additional drawdowns as we look forward
348129 relieves the burden on our forces and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
348130 thats something that would not have been possible just a few months ago
348131 we now have brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge the last of these surge brigades return home this month
348132 recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
348133 al qaeda is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
348134 i need to make a confession before i die i slept with your brother your best friend and your father
348135 im a dog chasing cars i wouldnt know what id do if i caught it
348136 what do you have planned for the rest of the day

348138 i was going to give this to you anyway i still think you should have it
348139 i wrote it while i was in the bathroom call me and well finish up that haircut
348140 well have to finish it at my house though i dont think youre allowed in the salon anymore
348141 it is my belief that anyone whether in a leadership position or not has a responsibility to display some personal restraint when addressing the public
348142 these words contribute nothing to the struggle of those who work toward harmonious race relations on a daily basis
348143 i think they the republicans did this to stir the pot because democrats have a black man sen barack obama d ill running for president
348144 i was beginning to wonder if there was a devils night killer
348145 i was hired to find him to take him out but he was always a step ahead of me like he was connected to the law or something like he had a radio and some backup or something or a team like yall are a team right i mean he had these plasticuffs like police issue and gas bombs like the fucking joker
348146 everything i saw pointed towards someone well connected a pro at ass kicking whole stash houses and meth labs wiped out like they were nothing thats paramility shit right there so i ask voltron about it get him tied up right where you are you know voltron right nigga with speed lines comin off his head dcons were his boys before the devils bought him out he was a tough mothafucka too held out for a minute thats raw son
348147 and voltron before his little heart gives out he tells me about this cop he met with a swastika tattoo on the back of his head like hes a nigger hater cop is that you cop
348148 maybe its the big stupid one whats his name mcbride or maybe its you
348149 you can see it just fine by parting the hair
348150 a skinhead put that on me while i was unconscious
348151 voltron said when he met you you were with a bunch of skinheads
348152 what does this have to do with the devils night killer
348153 i guess you could say ive given up on finding him your boy deeds wasnt any help i had to let him go hes in the potomac by now if you want to go find him
348154 youre going down fucker maybe not by our hands but by someones i swear to you on that
348155 so i guess the point is the devils are gonna pay me one way or another for the bounty on your ass so i dont even care if you did it mister nazi this is where we say goodbye

348157 my best friend just died in front of my eyes motherfucker do it
348158 im sorry about your friend i never wanted to hurt any cops i had nothing to do with deeds neither that was all street
348159 if deeds hadnt had dirt on him it would never had led street to the strike team i wasnt looking to frame up anyone i was just going to finish it and go to some lily white college town
348160 that explains the military angle the gas grenades the tactics the knifework wait you hired the scrips to hit your own guys no tipped them off on where to hit them right
348161 a military style serrated spork one of the scrips was carrying with a compass inside saw you using one i bet got it as a present or something
348162 wipe out the devils night crew from the inside out isnt that what you were trying to do from the outside in
348163 i told street to stay away from the cops i told them all dont fuck with the cops i even tried to warn you off remember the parking garage i tried to warn you off
348164 i had you chasing the ghost of marta wesson so youd let me finish what i started
348165 and i did it those ten punks out there theyre all thats left of devils night
348166 i just wanted you two cocksuckers to know that before we fucked you up
348167 he was only trying to get a confession out of me one the rest of your crew could hear
348168 then he did suspect me because he only gave blender the other end of that phone call
348169 theres ten of them and theyre not waiting and youve got a fractured wrist
348170 got one left might knock out forty percent of them if were lucky
348171 theyll come in the back mostly so you cover the front
348172 five in front five in back the other one didnt make it inside
348173 yarboroughs on the other side im bringing him in you with me
348174 give this back to street put it all on him then your boys get justice smitty and deeds
348175 that means i have a reason to spare your life nigga the devils night crew is just you and me now and im out which leaves it to you you in or you out
348176 you and smitty took these men out jack ballistics will support you and you even got an eyewitness its over you hear
348177 i cant promise that you and me are finished though
348178 you feel particularly inclined to go after his scary ass
348179 in that case i be right back massa what should i tell them
348180 just tell them where to find me and you might want to approach them with your hands up
348181 this is the place jack this is the site of the first dcon stash house back when voltron first started it all and this was taken over by the devils night crew
348182 my name is darius andre washington the last of the dcons and now the last of the devils night crew i have pulled the trigger on the arresting officer and showed showed respect to the memories of of the dead
348183 my crew is gone but theyve been revenged and i am darius andre washington the last of the mohitos
348184 coming from a school psychology background think of all the children who have been hurt by name calling
348185 people think its funny using racial slurs but its not
348186 and his young republicans follow along and say the same thing
348187 members of a particular culture or race may use derogatory terms among themselves and it may be ok but there is a danger of other people becoming accustomed to the vocabulary
348188 i see what art gallagher was trying to do i understand what he was trying to do but he could have just as easy called dangler up on the phone to start a conversation
348189 the naacp should be more concerned that jesse jackson is using the word rather than what art gallagher is doing
348190 whats so funny the men are all lost in the forest
348191 go and marry a girl who is a prostitute so that some of her children will be born to you from other men this will illustrate the way my people have been untrue to me committing open adultery against me by worshipping other gods
348192 name the child jezreel for in the valley of jezreel i am about to punish king jehus dynasty to avenge the murders he committed in fact i will put an end to israel as an independent kingdom breaking the power of the nation in the valley of jezreel

348195 me interezas tanto k kiero llamar tu atencion aun k eso me cueate mi dignidad
348196 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
348197 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
348198 road should not be closed for two days kills business in our town
348199 i think that as a representation of the kba board airing your dirty laundry that has a negative impact on pedestrians walking the town should be frowned upon
348200 i felt it should be their the kbas duty to have the sign taken down
348201 the issue is that as a council person im always representing keyport as a public official
348202 in his burlews capacity as a board member he has that responsibility
348203 she ought to mind her own business rather than worry about ed burlew
348204 gotham is in need of a hero they can believe in
348205 do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication
348206 wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly
348207 do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals
348208 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
348209 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
348210 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
348211 received information that suggests the other driver may have been travelling upwards of 50 miles an hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
348212 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
348213 its ok its kind of like a game you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
348214 the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin were looking for evidence against jesus so that they could put him to death but they did not find any

348245 we are stronger than before and when hizbollah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war we dont seek war but we must be ready
348246 israel didnt achieve any of its goals the known goal of israel is death to hizbollah hizbollah is still here

348250 the nato summit conference briefing materials were not adequately safeguarded
348251 genuinely had no idea what documents she was referring to
348252 since investigators were not able to interview ms couillard the investigation could not determine the circumstances by which she came into possession of the classified documents
348253 the incident itself was injurious to the national interest by tarnishing canadas good reputation within nato circles for safeguarding classified information
348254 what they are seemingly trying to do here is to put the blame almost entirely on mme couillard

348418 conclusion transwomen are just evil rapists in waiting who go through one hell of a lot of shit just to be able to sneak into the ladies loos
348419 but im a feminist who wants to end the gender binary so doesnt my thesis logically conclude that transpeople are wrong because if gender is a construct then a person cannot actually identify as a gender that is not actually real right so transpeople are a deluded because there is no gender and b betraying the cause by buying in to the concept of gender zomg transfolk are the enemy

348428 the spot on your chest wall is another melanoma site
348429 it is the serbs and the orthodox who are not respected thanks to milosevic and his apartheid and ethnic cleansing regime
348430 giving us maps of iliria which included kosovo half of macedonia a good portion of montenegro and of course albania
348431 yugoslav tanks and troops took up positions today in a province in the south to put down anti government riots by albanian separatists the separatists want to unite with albania the small and selfisolated communist country on the adriatic
348432 the nationalists have a two point platform first to establish what they call an ethnically clean albanian republic and then the merger with albania to form a greater albania
348433 there is no religious state or religious majority the local troubles are ethnic not religious catholics are very deeply respected
348434 the end of the national question in kosovo is the beginning of the religious one as new challenges to the social and clerical order arise from radical islam
348435 catholic albanians and evangelical groups have faced continued intimidation and harassment
348436 a common feature of many attacks was the underlying intention to force minorities to leave and or to ensure their silence through fear this strategy was effective
348437 such suspicion was fuelled by the fact that catholic albanian villages suffered relatively little damage during the conflict
348438 i felt ashamed after what happened in 2004 we were under some pressure as well
348439 because he was so excited about his new dog a rottweiler like so many in america have when the kla came in with nato he was killed just for not being a good albanian
348440 especially the atheist groups are gradually getting inclined towards islam because of extensive propaganda and activities of the islamist ngos
348441 kosovo has finally declared its independence after a long and determined struggle by its people as we rejoice in this happy result we declare our solidarity with and support to our brothers and sisters there
348442 the islamic umma nation wishes them success in the new battle awaiting them which is the building of a strong and prosperous state capable of satisfying its people there is no doubt that the independence of kosovo will be an asset to the muslim world and further enhance joint islamic action
348443 happily claiming that a vastly majority muslim state has been carved out of serbia a european christian country
348444 and we think it is a very positive step that this muslim state muslim majority state has been created today

348645 identified over the next week a formidable iraqi force that included 300 of saddam husseins most modern t 72 tanks an elite republican guard division and about 35 000 iraqi troops poised in a coil formation on kuwaits northern border even more ominous a long line of fuel trucks had joined the tail of the coil indicating the force was prepared to move an extended distance
348646 virtually impossible to close for an extended period even with advanced weapons and large numbers of aircraft

348660 as long as it is not over the part we are in that is absolutely no problem so we will let the helicopters fly that is a very important point and i want to make it sure that its recorded that military helicopters can fly over iraq

348668 came over here to play second base every day and lead off
348669 its just the swelling i have to work as fast as we can to get that out once thats gone hopefully i can just go back in there
348670 we cant erase all the losses that we had but thats the way im approaching it
348671 it was a july to forget august started good it was only a day but i already feel better than july
348672 it was a nice atmosphere and it had nothing to do with the guys who left
348673 but the guys who came in brought some energy theyre young guys with a lot of desire and full of life they went out there and gave us a great effort for our first game
348674 those two kids it was a great move by the team
348675 bonifacio might be one of the fastest runners in baseball it was good
348676 hi i am fishy97 on club penguin you can find me on mammoth
348677 confessed but is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
348678 i am sorry i did not know what i was doing
348679 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
348680 my intention was always to go to the convention to support hillary clinton
348681 i still believe in her i believe in her campaign and i would like to maintain my status as a supporter of hillary clinton
348682 im looking at this thing and im like what the hell is this
348683 ive never had an experience like this with this campaign or others
348684 i thought they crossed the line if you have a problem with a story i write call me first im a big boy i can handle it but they never called they attacked me like im a political opponent
348685 you cant stop whats bout to happen we bout to make history the first black president is destined and its meant to be the threats aint fazing us the nooses or the jokes so get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote
348686 p aint the white house black im sure thats got em terrified
348687 if you think ludacris language is foul read some of the comments posted from foul mouthed obama supporters
348688 obama has a problem among women over 40 and a big problem among women over 50 these groups normally the staunchest of democratic supporters are showing a propensity to back mccain
348689 the x rays were good its a little swollen but other than that it feels better now than it did when i came out
348690 its been a crazy year for us i think it seems like anything that can go wrong has and anything that can go right hasnt
348691 create permanent for sale housing for artists performers art educators and others affiliated with the arts and design worlds
348692 time to dig in and try to make things better
348693 so what are we to do to make things better
348694 one of those is the need for leadership and that doesnt mean just on the political front it needs to come from you me and the person next door
348695 that can be as simple as knowing what your children are doing or by being a good neighbor
348696 or it can involve participation in one of the many church or civic groups that are trying to tackle these tough issues
348697 those of us who live here know that lima is really a good community
348698 like all communities weve had our hard times but weve been resilient over the years and have worked our way through the problems
348699 its time to dig in and try to make things better
348700 well i mean our veteran players obviously theres not much of a market
348701 was our marketable guy that we traded the other ones theres not much of a market for obviously look were a last place team and a lot of them are underachieving so thats not surprising
348702 wed be open to a prospect for prospect kind of deal sure
348703 if we can fill a void that we need if we can find a deal that makes us better sure were open to that weve had a lot of discussions with a lot of clubs about a lot of players in our farm system thats taken most of our time
348704 you can never get enough pitching dont get me wrong
348705 so i never look to trade pitching that being said if there was a three four hole future hitter or a shortstop up the middle long term were always looking for that
348706 really good news knowing that hes not going to be added to that list of guys that are going to miss an extended period of time
348707 that being said its still gonna take a few days to get him back on the field
348708 with a strain im learning that its one of those things that you overdo it you just set yourself back and i dont want to do that
348709 hi im mr g im the bomb image is everything
348710 i hope i dont mess things up were a different team with zim on it
348711 like i explained to him he only has to go out there when he feels good and good enough to where he feels like he can give us a chance to win with him being out there
348712 but if he doesnt feel like his body is going to allow that on a particular day all he has got to do is go to ozzie guillen
348713 i think he wanted me to know in case i didnt know not to expect what we were used to seeing out there
348714 thats the reason i said you only play when you feel great when you dont feel great or dont feel healthy thats ok because we have plenty of options we only want his presence when hes right
348715 i told him that its not as if hes replacing the prototypical guy that was already out there
348716 listen im not trying to kid anybody about having all the answers on this
348717 if this works great home run if it doesnt its still a double well find a way to make it work and still have what he can give us offensively
348718 the atmosphere and environment of incommunicado interrogation as it exists today is inherently intimidating and works to undermine the privilege against self incrimination
348719 these searches are not voluntary because people feel compelled to assent
348720 that is the product of official intimidation or harassment is not consent at all
348721 an articulable suspicion that the search will yield evidence of illegal activity
348722 were going to get younger for the last two months and were going to continue to develop young players we want players here that are going to hustle and play the game hard and play the game right we just feel at this point we need to give younger players an opportunity and were going to do that
348723 but i understand the business and everything they just signed a couple young guys that deserve a chance just like i did when i went up i dont have nothing bad to say i wish those guys the best
348724 anna you need to do my blush no one does my blush like you do
348725 like if i got hurt i just want to keep playing keep playing keep playing
348726 when it get to that point you can do nothing
348727 it keeps bothering it gets to that point you have to stop thats what happened with this i cant even swing anymore
348728 you have to always hold him back i think the day after he was operated on he wanted to go take left field in the big leagues its hard to control him because hes such a competitor and he always wants to be on the field
348729 today we scored some runs and then the pitching wasnt there
348730 i walked a 45 year old pitcher thats completely inexcusable
348731 and you all saw what happened after that base hit base hit home run end of the ballgame for me
348732 redding basically dug his own grave by not getting the eighth hitter and then walking the pitcher
348733 i didnt execute the pitches i needed to execute in the fifth inning especially and we lose 8 5 without those five runs we might win the game
348734 right now were just trying to deal with the diabetes
348735 as i said its a two pronged mission you cant do the second prong until you do the first prong
348736 the doctors said i can take the sling off when im sitting around laying around
348737 just because everybody who sees you here is gonna come up and shake your hand and you really cant do that
348738 ill be able to go shoulder high in a couple weeks
348739 he never gave us any signs of a problem until spring training when his velocity was down
348740 no team in baseball would give him 6 2 million after labrum surgery
348741 i told him chad we want to have you back
348742 my dad always said youre going to play in the big leagues some day
348743 i pooh poohed that i would be like aw dad please dont say that and sure enough here i am
348744 really i just cant believe that a kid from colorado just a big fan of the game its totally overwhelming being elected to the hall and to have had the career that i had
348745 that ball was bouncing all over the place he just beat us he just flat out beat us he had it tonight
348746 it kind of gets on your mind a little bit that we can play better than how were playing right now but we dont let anything linger you know its on to the next day we have a game every day i say it repeatedly this year about our struggles we play every day and every day weve got to strap it on
348747 i thought it was a great decision on my part and i went for it
348748 you know we want to be aggressive on the base paths
348749 i really hate not doing well at something im really just not a good hitter i choked up really high
348750 i thought there was no chance in hell id hit a ball square im just not that good a hitter
348751 proven time and time again that he is part of our future here
348752 i had him the whole game that breaking ball was up
348753 well with kent up there i went 2 0 and i was overthrowing a lot randy came out and settled me down
348754 he told me just to back off a little bit just hit my spots that whole inning i was all over the place i was trying to throw too hard and just got away from what i was doing the whole game
348755 he had very good command of his pitches early in the game
348756 whenever he got in trouble he made the pitch to get the double play or the outs they hit him but not that hard im proud of the young man he continues to go out there nothing bothers him about our lack of scoring runs for him
348757 well im not an overpowering pitcher ive got to go out there and hit my spots thats what ive been doing all year so i cant just go out there and do too much i learned that when i went back out there in the seventh i didnt do too much got a couple ground balls and got the team back in the dugout
348758 hes been our most dominant guy out of our bullpen and has the best numbers so hell get the crack at it
348759 how about children who have passed out and have not had earth life experience
348760 if we had left the earth life we would know nothing
348761 how about children who have passed out and have not had earth life experience
348762 if we had left the earth life we would know nothing
348763 internet explorer cannot open the internet site whatever one it is
348764 if 3g has to succeed in india then operators will have to take the affordability plank we have seen this in voice services where the uptake was low as long as the tariffs were high in other countries 3g may be a premium service but here it could be a different story
348765 a foreign player will have to commit a minimum investment of 1 billion for 3g in india that will make sure that only a few serious players will come in
348766 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
348767 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you who doesnt want to be there
348768 its obvious from anything you see or hear he doesnt want to be here leaving him here would have been a problem because you dont know what youre going to get
348769 but he thought about it and talked to his family its a good opportunity for him they pursued him and went after him
348770 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
348771 i think you have overpayed in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
348772 id like to see timesheets posted on the internet for the work of the directors as well as the executives of the company
348773 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
348774 no one can do anything about the hitting all we have to do is is every single time no matter if you have a 10 run offense and score 10 runs a game you have to try to go six innings two runs or less than that
348775 it was one of my better performances of the year
348776 i just keep getting stronger and stronger as the years go on im learning so much and just trying to put it into every start i feel a little bit more comfortable now if every start we could do that the hittings going to be there
348777 he pounded the zone with the three pitches he has
348778 that will help when you have the good stuff like he does
348779 i wondered how long it would take you to notice me
348780 i really do need to get that insect book from the library
348781 jeez i must have landed pretty hard to jar the door open that way
348782 is expected to open in 2012 and there will be years of testing before its techniques could have widespread application
348783 typically you expect to see steady growth or scores holding steady
348784 we observed changes that are outside of what you would expect to see
348785 despite the problems ive had faith in the testing system until this year
348786 i dont think this problem will be worked out until two to three years from now and by then we will have moved on to another assessment
348787 this is yet another example of why critics warn against the overuse of standardized tests for high stakes decisions like student retention school ratings and teacher firings
348788 these exams are not the absolute accurate measure politicians say they are
348789 we want to work with the state to arrive at a solution but we are very concerned about these results
348790 last year ctv sales were good because we had cricket world cup during the period and air conditioners did not perform as well as it did last year may be because of intermittent showers during the period this year
348791 we could register a growth of around 30 per cent in the first six months of the year linked with the samsung sales infrastructure and channel expansion and our marketing activities
348792 theres been more races in chicagoland this year and even last year than there ever have been
348793 im traveling less because there are more options and opportunities here
348794 riders can be going 30 miles per hour plus on a course
348795 its looked at in the cycling world to be more serious
348796 its amazing to have three races like that within a month let alone in one area
348797 i am a special one and i am a champion of europe
348798 are the disclosure guidelines just for blogs no these guidelines are useful any place where your employees are commenting or participating in a conversation they are useful for all social media and in particular any time there is a question of personal vs corporate voice role
348799 what happened to that eddie murphy movie that was supposed to win him an oscar
348800 childrens hunger alliance is a statewide nonprofit organization looking to break the cycle of hunger through leadership advocacy and education
348801 its just fun getting to come out here and play with the kids and to see them have fun
348802 its lots of fun i like the hockey thing a lot where you have to shoot the ball in the holes
348803 is an opportunity for kids to come together and play together and meet some other kids in their neighborhoods
348804 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
348805 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
348806 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
348807 es como una m quina del tiempo para la web
348808 kami ingin mendapatkan perlakuan hukum yang benar karena pengobatan kami di rscm atas rujukan dari rumah sakit daerah tetapi di sini kami malah ditelantarkan
348809 we will probably go home and count our blessings how lucky we are that none of our family was killed or actually on the bridge
348810 they feel really strongly that they need to support everyone
348811 and they are just willing to give the gift of sound to help we are just thinking about the hausmann family and every other family that lost someone or anyone who was affected by this at all
348812 turn your head to the new 35w bridge for the unfurling of the american flag in honor of the victims their families and all those changed by this tragedy
348813 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help
348814 this is a choice between action and doing more of the same a choice between moving forward and the status quo
348815 it was the earnest effort of the last three administrations to get this gas line moving forward
348816 but the market is going to move this line forward my concern is this license is going to tie alaskas hands
348817 we work with oil and gas firms every day to get their gas to market
348818 the three largest leaseholders on the north slope are some of our largest customers in fact bp is our largest gas customer today on our north america pipeline system
348819 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
348820 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
348821 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
348822 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
348823 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
348824 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
348825 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
348826 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
348827 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
348828 the intention is clearly to bring up this sexual desire and i dont think thats beneficial for our society
348829 they are being exposed to sex and to talk about sex before theyre even old enough to even think about having sex
348830 television is going downhill fast and the programmers sometimes seem to me to be racing each other to see how they can push the envelope in terms of negative sexual content
348831 when i lost my job over it my wife was so upset and distraught and distressed that she had a major heart attack
348832 sex is the most primal urge in every single one of us
348833 a bad boy is a guy whos unapologetically male loves being naughty and loves seducing women
348834 these guys are not sorry for what they did theyre sorry for only one thing and that is getting caught
348835 you cant be in a monogamous relationship if you feel like youre settling or youre missing out
348836 everything inside of us all of the blood running through our veins is going look look look we cannot look at a womans chest we have to physically try not to
348837 we want the swedish girl the hispanic girl the black girl the redhead girl the brainiac
348838 thats where the whole thing started was a friendship between nancy and i
348839 its gonna sound weird but phil just kind of came into the package of the friendship
348840 to deal with this people upside is they will not be obliged to please some politicians with some agenda downside is we will see some violations of human rights and some corruption
348841 they stand for non violence and their protest is against violence of all kinds in their case they do the far more important job of raising their voice against state run terrorism and terrorists in uniform and in the assemblies
348842 they do the far more important job of raising their voice
348843 they stand for non violence and their protest is against violence of all kinds in their case they do the far more important job of raising their voice against state run terrorism and terrorists in uniform and in the assemblies
348844 they do the far more important job of raising their voice
348845 shows professionalism in following district and ohsaa guidelines policies and procedures
348846 manage his staff to ensure they do not engage in conduct that could be interpreted as recruiting
348847 like any other case the ohsaa has no authority to request or even a desire to see a school representatives personnel file and in this particular instance the school did not offer to share the file
348848 the ohsaas responsibility would be to focus on the violations at hand a scenario that could have impacted the outcome would have been if he would have had other ohsaa violations that appeared in our files but personal items in his school file would more than likely not have a bearing
348849 efforts that might be misconstrued as improper recruitment of student athletes
348850 qui n va a ver algo de tan poca calidad
348851 i promise you i ill come back to you one day
348852 hes a big boy its just a matter of quickness for him
348853 gerald ford was president when i became a head coach and i noted his passing recently
348854 weve got three or four kids that are supposed to go somewhere
348855 ive gotten to work with a lot of great people
348856 little house on the prairie is a brand that people want and its our responsibility to make sure it lives up to its name
348857 the shows got to be correct it is very much a work in progress and we hope we get it right at the guthrie
348858 when you cast a show you often talk about who you wish you could get
348859 i pick up the phone i reach for the stars and in this particular case i got her
348860 we his producing group have taken a giant step back while the guthrie produces this show
348861 we are there to help but it is the guthries production
348862 whether its midsummer or little house on the prairie our structure is such that we dont make money to put on a musical in a less than 700 seat house is not something that someone would do in a commercial venture were not sitting on a cash cow
348863 as a kid i read the books and then when my children were growing up we watched the tv show
348864 i think its obviously a huge thing for young girls who have read these books
348865 ive never been to a show here where ive seen so many young women who have read these books and who have a real connection to it thats going to be a huge selling factor
348866 externalities in the classroom how children exposed to domestic violence affect everyones kids
348867 it doesnt matter if youre michael jordan you go through the same thing when you start losing your hair
348868 we like to think of ourselves as the anti hair club for men
348869 i look at the guys that try the comb over or hang on to the last little bit of hair and i just want to give them a hug and say hey man let it go
348870 my favorite is comparing benjamin franklin who had the guts to go natural with george washington who was bald you know
348871 he was out there dodging bullets on the battlefield but straightening his wig
348872 because i do have terminal cancer im looking for things that make me laugh and that just cracked me up to think there are people out there who are willing to accept me into their group
348873 people are concerned when they see a child with no hair but if theyre wearing the t shirt it says i do know im bald but you dont have to worry
348874 this is the people of st pauls gift to the men and women whove chosen to serve
348875 they feel very much for their colleagues and friends and for those who are left back in the philippines who are now mourning
348876 the people who died were well known locally we feel for the loss of these fishermen everyone here is devastated
348877 cps energy wants to make the move right across the street about 1 500 feet from the current location just because it would be the least expensive move
348878 i dont think anyone would want to be living with that substation in your backyard or having your children play near it
348879 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
348880 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
348881 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
348882 i do not choose to run for president in 1928
348883 a man who does not lose his reason over certain things has none to lose
348884 the officers never stepped on the gas to try and pursue
348885 hmm how do i get her to put those thick luscious lips around my cock
348886 some are a little more happy go lucky than others accepting the fact that it happened and theyre going on with their lives
348887 there was a design flaw and no redundancy system so the bridge went down in a matter of moments but we suggest today that our relationships are the redundancy system that catches and carries us and is built into our faith our traditions and our community
348888 but more should be made of the bridges that were built that bonded together this community of one time strangers
348889 it would be a mistake for us to think our role as a beloved community of faith is over our challenge now is to sustain our compassion over many years to make sure that we heal wounds
348890 bims is shaping up to be a hallmark event for the kingdom of bahrain with its unique exhibits of production classic concept and performance cars across different brands and its timely significance its inaugural launch in october coincides with the celebration of eid al fitr enabling thousands of car enthusiasts and families to visit the show at the bahrain international exhibition amp convention center biec

348893 not only did he use the n word he called him a gdn goddamn niger if you catch my drift
348894 he has used the n word before bill would make snide remarks about blacks behind their backs
348895 probably six eight ten times she would be upset with someone in the black community and she would use the n word like you heard theyve got the presidents brother on tape using the n word
348896 some junior high niggr kicked steves as s while he was trying to help his brothers out junior high or sophomore in high school whatever it was steve had the niggr down however it was it was steves fault he had the niggr down he let him up the niggr blindsided him

348898 hey that was not supposed to be released to the public
348899 that was just another dirty trick by his ex wife
348900 come on he was just drunk i dont trust that b tch hes married too
348901 to punish a crime which goes to the destruction of the executive power of the government he meant that description of crime which arises from an interference of individual citizens in the negotiations of our executive with foreign governments
348902 the people of the united states have given to the executive department the power to negotiate with foreign governments and to carry on all foreign relations and that it is therefore an usurpation of that power for an individual to undertake to correspond with any foreign power on any dispute between the two governments or for any state government or any other department of the general government to do it
348903 it would be extremely improper for a member of this house to enter into any correspondence with the french republic as we are not at war with france an offence of this kind would not be high treason yet it would be as criminal an act as if we were at war
348904 being entrusted to the executive the decision of the executive is conclusive
348905 into the field of negotiation the senate cannot intrude and congress itself is powerless to invade it
348906 we came in friendship hope and determined that the road to damascus is a road to peace
348907 no no no i believe this fvcking moron knew exactly what he was doing
348908 when the right lane is closed and a construction flashing sign says merge left
348909 stop and wait for them to finish building the fvcking interstate
348910 im sure that motherfvcker gets a cut of the action
348911 last fall paul mccartney headlined a concert to benefit victims of september 11th some politicians appeared including senator hillary clinton
348912 and people in the audience booed her booed and heckled
348913 not only did he use the n word he called him a gdn
348914 he has used the n word before bill would make snide remarks about blacks behind their backs
348915 probably six eight ten times she would be upset with someone in the black community and she would use the n word like you heard theyve got the presidents brother on tape using the n word
348916 washington was beaten with shovels and bricks he was castrated and his ears were cut off a tree supported the iron chain that lifted him above the fire wailing the boy attempted to climb up the skillet hot chain for this the men cut off his fingers

348919 what happened to these two children could happen to other children
348920 one thing that people and teens who are contemplating suicide will do is give away personal items
348921 like hell give you his class ring but he just graduated
348922 ask the question a lot of times children will feel relieved
348923 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states but it agreement satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
348924 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
348925 fbi involved currently under investigation and will be charged with five capital murders
348926 dr david irwin his psychiatrist called him homicidal sociopathic with clear intentions
348927 this isnt a religious accommodation this is a contractual agreement
348928 the commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the negative effects of global warming and climate change any longer
348929 sea temperatures continue to rise storm intensity is predicted to heighten and our economy the publics health and our precious ecosystem are in jeopardy
348930 if global warming and climate change continue to remain unchecked in the commonwealth the cost of inaction will be in the billions
348931 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
348932 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
348933 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers
348934 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
348935 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
348936 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
348937 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
348938 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
348939 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
348940 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
348941 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
348942 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
348943 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
348944 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
348945 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
348946 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
348947 they can only make a small difference at the margins
348948 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
348949 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
348950 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
348951 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
348952 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
348953 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
348954 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
348955 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
348956 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
348957 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
348958 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
348959 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
348960 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
348961 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
348962 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
348963 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
348964 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
348965 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
348966 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
348967 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
348968 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
348969 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
348970 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
348971 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
348972 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
348973 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
348974 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
348975 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
348976 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
348977 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
348978 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
348979 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
348980 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
348981 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
348982 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
348983 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
348984 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
348985 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
348986 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
348987 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
348988 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
348989 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
348990 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
348991 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
348992 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
348993 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
348994 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
348995 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
348996 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
348997 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
348998 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
348999 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
349000 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
349001 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
349002 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
349003 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
349004 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
349005 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
349006 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
349007 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
349008 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
349009 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
349010 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
349011 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
349012 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
349013 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
349014 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
349015 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
349016 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
349017 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
349018 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
349019 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
349020 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
349021 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
349022 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
349023 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
349024 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
349025 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
349026 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
349027 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
349028 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
349029 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
349030 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
349031 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
349032 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
349033 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
349034 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
349035 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
349036 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
349037 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
349038 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
349039 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
349040 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
349041 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
349042 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
349043 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
349044 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
349045 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
349046 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
349047 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
349048 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
349049 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
349050 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
349051 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
349052 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
349053 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
349054 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
349055 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
349056 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
349057 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
349058 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
349059 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
349060 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
349061 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
349062 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
349063 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
349064 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
349065 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
349066 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
349067 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
349068 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
349069 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
349070 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
349071 are you better off now than you were four years ago
349072 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
349073 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
349074 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
349075 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
349076 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
349077 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
349078 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
349079 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
349080 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
349081 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
349082 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
349083 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
349084 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
349085 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
349086 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
349087 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
349088 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
349089 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
349090 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
349091 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
349092 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
349093 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
349094 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
349095 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
349096 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
349097 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
349098 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
349099 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
349100 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
349101 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
349102 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
349103 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
349104 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
349105 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
349106 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
349107 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
349108 immune support energy and stamina stress support focus and clarity

349114 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
349115 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
349116 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
349117 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
349118 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
349119 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
349120 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
349121 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
349122 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
349123 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
349124 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
349125 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
349126 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
349127 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
349128 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
349129 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
349130 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
349131 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
349132 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
349133 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
349134 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
349135 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
349136 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
349137 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
349138 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
349139 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
349140 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
349141 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
349142 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
349143 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
349144 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
349145 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
349146 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
349147 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
349148 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
349149 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
349150 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
349151 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
349152 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
349153 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
349154 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
349155 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
349156 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
349157 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
349158 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
349159 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
349160 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
349161 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
349162 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
349163 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
349164 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
349165 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
349166 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
349167 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
349168 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
349169 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
349170 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
349171 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
349172 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
349173 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
349174 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
349175 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
349176 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
349177 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
349178 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
349179 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
349180 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
349181 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
349182 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
349183 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
349184 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
349185 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
349186 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
349187 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
349188 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
349189 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
349190 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
349191 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
349192 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
349193 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
349194 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
349195 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
349196 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
349197 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
349198 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
349199 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
349200 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
349201 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
349202 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
349203 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
349204 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
349205 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
349206 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
349207 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
349208 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
349209 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
349210 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
349211 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
349212 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
349213 blank frank is the messenger of your doom and your destruction
349214 ohhh microtonality that just produces a lot of good theory and a lot of bad music
349215 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
349216 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
349217 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
349218 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
349219 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
349220 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
349221 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
349222 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
349223 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
349224 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
349225 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
349226 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
349227 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
349228 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
349229 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
349230 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
349231 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
349232 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
349233 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
349234 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
349235 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
349236 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
349237 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
349238 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
349239 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
349240 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
349241 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
349242 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
349243 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
349244 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
349245 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
349246 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
349247 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
349248 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
349249 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
349250 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
349251 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
349252 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
349253 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
349254 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
349255 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
349256 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
349257 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
349258 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
349259 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
349260 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
349261 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
349262 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
349263 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
349264 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
349265 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
349266 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
349267 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
349268 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
349269 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
349270 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
349271 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
349272 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
349273 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
349274 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
349275 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
349276 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
349277 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
349278 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
349279 it was a blast and probably the first time in my life when i felt i had enough sex for my appetite
349280 however just a few hours after the show when i woke up in the morning i found myself masturbating and i ended having webcam again i wasnt sore at all nor dry and since then lingering thoughts about the gangbang have left me craving for more
349281 she is as smart as she is sexy and she clearly enjoyed the action from start to finish we look forward to carring more of her live shows on onecams com
349282 you know its not about you its about your country
349283 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
349284 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
349285 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
349286 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
349287 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
349288 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
349289 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
349290 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
349291 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
349292 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
349293 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
349294 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
349295 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
349296 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
349297 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
349298 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
349299 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
349300 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
349301 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
349302 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
349303 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
349304 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
349305 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
349306 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
349307 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
349308 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
349309 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
349310 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
349311 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
349312 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
349313 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
349314 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
349315 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
349316 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
349317 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
349318 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
349319 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
349320 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
349321 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
349322 i had a game plan this year and i wrote it down and pretty much stuck to that plan
349323 i didnt make any birdies all day and just kept hitting the greens so im happy to be tied with the lead
349324 that was a key putt because i didnt want to make a bogey
349325 i did what i had to do so it was nice to be able to do that
349326 i had an eagle or birdie putt on every hole
349327 but really i didnt putt that well and most of my birdies were short putts
349328 there are a lot of good players coming out now so i hope im at least near the lead when the day is done
349329 i just wanted to come out here and have fun
349330 you shouldnt take golf so seriously and thats what i tried to do i work out here so i know the course pretty well
349331 ive been playing really good this summer and thats confidence
349332 the thing is i trust my driver and its one of my best clubs in the bag
349333 all i want to do is have fun and not take it too seriously
349334 if i didnt think i could win i would have gone to the beach
349335 fortunately it appears the doctors were able to diagnose things early and they expect me to enjoy a complete recovery
349336 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea

349338 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
349339 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
349340 so its my responsibility to bring it to him this is what i do i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him

349343 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
349344 were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far
349345 given that people are interested in trying to cut travel videoconferencing is an area thats going to grow
349346 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
349347 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year

349352 the canadian federal system is a very decentralized system by choice
349353 it is not an accident of history that we have a decentralized federal system it is one of the conditions that permitted the creation of the country
349354 the power of voice managerial affective states and future firm performance
349355 consider a manager who believes she is competent and in control of the firm information about firm performance would reflect her actions taken while running the firm if the manager has private information that is inconsistent with her beliefs regarding her competence an uncomfortable emotional state will arise
349356 you lose enough hats and glasses in the river youll eventually learn

349358 state law contractually guarantees that state employes ultimately will receive their full salary for work performed during a budget impasse
349359 does not authorize the controller to disburse state funds to the employes until an applicable appropriation has been enacted
349360 i dont want to subject the state of california to legal liability
349361 under the fair labor standards act if we do not pay full wage we may be subject to treble damages that would only exacerbate an already difficult financial situation
349362 would we want to test it when there is very little upside and significant downside at risk
349363 thank you god for the beautiful flowers thank you for all the beautiful creation around us
349364 thats how i see you thats how i see all my people i look and see my people as beautiful flowers that i created and love

349404 weve been happy with the way hes come up this prep
349405 he trials like he ran just then so we thought we might as well save it for the race track
349406 hes a big horse and hes held his condition well and it was probably a good choice in not going to a trial where he wins by 4 or 5 lengths to take on a race of 1100 metres
349407 we might just press on and stay around this level until he earns his stripes a bit more
349408 weve just had a couple of foot issues with him so well just have to monitor that
349409 we elected to go forward but i was happy when she got back because i think its best from back there
349410 i think she is as good as her half brother gunfire messiah
349411 if she can stand up i think she can win some races
349412 shes got two fetlock joints that are a problem to her
349413 maybe a little stakes race nothing too major for her though
349414 she actually went to werribee for them to check out her wind
349415 so they dropped her off at my place on the way home to canberra and i said id have a look at her
349416 i thought she wasnt too good in the joints so i gave her six months off and then gave her a go

349419 carlin was born on may 12 1937 in new york he dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and joined the air force where his misfit ways continued he received three courts martial and several punishments after leaving the military he spent a few years in radio where he met jack burns in 1960 the pair left to pursue a comedy career in los angeles carlin went solo in 1962 for most of the decade he was a conservative looking presence clean shaven attired in jacket and tie making his amused observations to audiences on the tonight show and the ed sullivan show but as the times changed so did carlin he let his hair down grew a beard and dressed in jeans and tie dyed t shirts it was this carlin who became a hit with college audiences in the early 70s

349426 i tell the players every day not to believe what people are writing and saying about them
349427 you cant let that kind of thing go to their heads i learned a long time ago that you dont live in the past and you dont live in the future
349428 on the question of authority classical protestants and roman catholics agree that the whims and views of private spirits are not to be considered the ground of any authority whatever
349429 these various reasons include the formal rejection of private judgment by rome
349430 relying on his own skill shall in matters of faith and of morals pertaining to the edifications of christian doctrine wresting the sacred scripture to his own senses presume to interpret the said sacred scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother church whose it is to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the holy scriptures
349431 vatican i agrees with this rejecting the heretics that trent rejected those heretics who
349432 but the task of authentically interpreting the word of god whether written or handed on has been entrusted exclusively to the living teaching office of the church
349433 as you are considering a return to rome i want to urge you to remember all the different ways in which private judgment will necessarily still be exercised by you
349434 assume for a moment that we agree that we sinners all have need of an infallible interpreter how do you know that you have picked the right infallible interpreter
349435 third lets assume that you do the normal average thing and simply begin attending the local parish church
349436 fourth private judgment has to engage in a strenuous effort to submit to the magisterium and
349437 for just one particular example the catechism of the catholic church says that muslims as muslims can be saved
349438 the plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the creator in the first place amongst whom are the muslims these profess to hold the faith of abraham and together with us they adore the one merciful god mankinds judge on the last day
349439 fifth assume that a roman catholic has a written document from the church which is beyond dispute part of this magisterium
349440 christs resurrection is the fulfillment of the promises both of the old testament and of jesus himself during his earthly life
349441 therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the holy spirit we must acknowledge that the books of scripture firmly faithfully and without error teach that truth which god for the sake of our salvation wished to see confined to the sacred scriptures
349442 seventh private judgment needs to frame the question before it rightly
349443 with all this said i would like to spend just a little time pointing to relevant scriptures
349444 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few
349445 paul commands the galatians to exercise private judgment if apostles or angels show up teaching anything contrary to the true depositum fidei
349446 i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say
349447 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
349448 the apostle john also expects believers to have their wits about them and to use them
349449 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
349450 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed
349451 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
349452 when dealing with gnostics and jws it seems that our duties are clear
349453 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you
349454 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
349455 every humble piece of wood in the building must reject false carpenters
349456 cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge
349457 i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy precepts
349458 private judgment has led to the chaos of the modern divided church
349459 finally at the final day of judgment god does not count by twos or tens each individual will stand before him to give an account and if that individual sat under the ministry of lies then that individual will be judged accordingly and all in full accordance with the scriptures
349460 now the irony is that all faiths provided they last more than one generation are organic faiths de facto despite what they may say in their creeds
349461 hail mary the five solas or great is diana of the ephesians
349462 the faithful and scriptural ideal is to have the organic life and the truth taught about that life from the word line up
349463 and as i see it the approach you are contemplating undermines the organic connection of the covenantal history of the church prior to the coming of the lord
349464 were not evaluating 1500 years of church history but examining the new teaching of the gospel in the light of the revelation of the law and the prophets
349465 related to this you say that john the baptist did not start a rival temple
349466 but how can the bereans examine this way without placing themselves in the position of final authority
349467 it seemed to us that in the realm of christianity private judgment inevitably requires an authoritative church to avoid becoming individual judgment
349468 and this is where i believe you back away from your organic commitment to authority significantly
349469 idea of the magisterium is that of a living body of authoritative interpreters of the deposit of revelation the primary part of which is inscripturated in the bible it is quite misleading to consider it merely as the collection of writings left by the magisteria of the past although these too are part of the magisterial gift to the church at large
349470 i am not saying these things because i need more precise propositions in order to make all my syllogisms happy
349471 what if i slowed down and just put on some gravitas in my voice
349472 within minutes of seeing you do your job which you have been doing for years he is at least 50 i can tell you are annoying people
349473 you follow what i say do you understand i know what is best for you
349474 what if i slowed down and just put on some gravitas in my voice
349475 within minutes of seeing you do your job which you have been doing for years he is at least 50 i can tell you are annoying people
349476 you follow what i say do you understand i know what is best for you
349477 i would never ever compare myself to her she insists
349478 shes like you know its elle macpherson its definitely a compliment but no shes a very savvy businesswoman
349479 heavy royalty component suggesting hawkins has backed herself to sell plenty of bikinis
349480 when i first met her she was this person who could not believe what had just happened to her now you are dealing with a person who very much knows what has happened to her and is not only very aware of whats gone on but is very aware of what is going to happen in the future
349481 shes got a lot of options shes one of the busiest people i know and once shes doing something shes committed to it
349482 certainly with make me a supermodel she has attacked this with gusto its not just a case of turning up and reading lines she has been absolutely passionate about the project and passionate about making it work and passionate about making sure that the show is as good as it can be
349483 theres nothing of the airhead starlet about jennifer hawkins ill tell you shes a driven young woman
349484 i have seen her grow over the last few years and she knows where she wants to get to and pretty much how she is going to get there
349485 shes like a professional hoover she knows what she doesnt know so when she wants to learn more about something shes quite insistent and thats to her credit
349486 weve yet to see her reach her full potential he said
349487 i think shes pretty savvy she has a clear vision she is seriously becoming a business now and the relationship she has with myer is indicative of that
349488 she sells and shes well liked holder says what i like about her is theres still an element there that shes pinching herself going wow how lucky am i
349489 shes very aware of her appeal and the essence of her appeal and she zealously guards that
349490 what weve done is made sure that weve partnered up brands that she genuinely believes in and genuinely likes he says
349491 weve needed to be really disciplined in terms of knocking back all the other opportunities
349492 when the time is right we will work towards a situation where she can explore some tv opportunities overseas he says
349493 i think in the last couple of years jennifer has really got a good handle on her career path and shes got a very good sense for the sort of things we should do to stay on track he says
349494 shes really good at worrying about the big stuff but letting the little stuff sort of got through to the keeper in this business its very easy to let what happens do your brain in
349495 its very easy to piss people off in this business but jen doesnt shes not rude to people she doesnt jostle people out of the camera she doesnt do anything to annoy anyone she just lives her life and she does her work and when shes not working shes at home shes just very grounded
349496 ive never had anyone say that her personality has changed

349623 im so proud of you ive missed you every day i love you
349624 its almost disappointing to see my girlfriend as were stuck in here
349625 we cant talk about what we really need to talk about she knows everything that i want to know
349626 there goes mike again always making me a better person
349627 even if they lose it doesnt matter its just the hype
349628 for him to come here i know hes got a goofy attitude like a lot of us do at work
349629 like i dont like this job anymore you guys are pressing me too hard ive left jobs too where i dont like working here anymore
349630 im excited for him to be here because hes going to have a new attitude and its going to give the dodgers an excellent chance down the stretch theres a big bat in the lineup it totally changes the complexion of the team
349631 i was thrilled because hell help the dodgers get to the world series
349632 im not a big fan of these rent a player things although he probably will help them so its kind of like mixed emotions
349633 i follow manny because hes one of those players that if youre walking by the tv and hes hitting youre going to stop and see what he does because hes always doing something unpredictable
349634 hopefully manny ramirez is the guy that were looking for hopefully he gets us over that hump and takes us to the promised land
349635 i found that i would select the cube when left clicking on it in object mode if the
349636 when you want the cursor back into the cube just select the camera with rmb put the cursor into the cube following the steps above and re select the cube with rmb
349637 ive discovered it helps a lot if you are in object mode and not in edit mode i wrote the following before discovering this
349638 i failed at this until i had zoomed in close enough to the cube when i was too far zoomed out i kept selecting the cube rather than creating an edit point
349639 i had the same problem and found it was because the cube was selected i made sure i was in object mode right clicked on the camera to select the camera instead of the cube and i could then position the edit point in the cube however doing this messed up the next part of the tutorial because you cannot switch into edit mode with the camera selected perhaps the suggestion of trying to put the 3d cursor in the cube should be dropped as it raises too many questions at this stage
349640 you can deselect all by pressing the akey or the select button in the 3d view
349641 use wireframe mode works better to get the cursor in
349642 to get it back in the cube 1 make sure youre in object mode 2 select the cube 3 object gt snap gt cursor to selection cursor refers to the 3d cursor here so it puts it right in the middle of the cube
349643 i think its an essential point to note that in order to place the cursor inside the cube the cube must not be selected akey was probably the best way to deselect the object
349644 ctrl z does undo but blender doesnt seem to store nearly so many previous actions i think its only one or two
349645 if i remember correctly undo history gets cleared when you switch between object and edit mode
349646 i wasted a lot of time here thank you to the reader who suggested on the 3d view header object gt snap gt cursor to selection it was the only thing that worked to get the cursor visible again and placed where clicked
349647 you can set the number of steps the undo command can do as mentioned in earlier pages
349648 so i can move the 3d cursor but what if i want to put it back in its original spot
349649 how do we work in a virtual 3d environment through a 2d screen
349650 i have talked with him and i dont believe the idea of a transfer has any part in his life
349651 he feels very good at ajax we will do our all to keep him at the club of course
349652 if we dont want it a transfer will be difficult anyway
349653 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
349654 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality
349655 we dont need money to buy someone but its not just to buy it has to be the right person that is at the moment very difficult
349656 its not a problem because we have enough young players who can step in
349657 but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it
349658 i believe we were very unlucky last season as a squad we have made a big improvement last year we lost the premier league by four points
349659 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title
349660 we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
349661 when i was on holiday there was a lot of speculation people were talking on my behalf which is not me
349662 anyone can put what they want in the newspaper you can do it somebody else can do it i never told anyone that i would be leaving this club
349663 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
349664 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
349665 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
349666 i am very happy being at this club being part of this family
349667 now the most important thing is to keep my head on my shoulders what i did last season is behind me already
349668 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league
349669 it is true we are young but we know that if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something
349670 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
349671 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request it should be the other way round
349672 the rules are quite clear if you want a player you call the club and ask how much they want for him are you ready to sell him
349673 if its no you dont need to speak to the player because no is no
349674 we play them tomorrow and im looking forward to a great game tomorrow we love playing in tournaments like these
349675 but i cant give you any answer about van der vaart how do you want me to give you the answer when i dont know anything about it
349676 well youll have to ask other people in the chain
349677 these are matters that arent concerning me im only involved with my team and the matches this weekend
349678 and at the moment it seems very fashionable to do those things
349679 its happening all the time in the world of football its almost as if anything goes
349680 but i dont know if you can stop it it would certainly be very difficult
349681 do i think real madrid do it no no i dont feel were guilty of it at all
349682 i like playing with the best and villa is one of those
349683 but if we dont sign anyone well the team is very very good anyway
349684 we are the champions of the spanish league were a good unit with players that are nice people as well as nice footballers
349685 we dont want to scream at them or push it down their throats
349686 we havent seen him so we dont know the extent of his injury but like every club with a structure like this like sao paulo we want to have everything in place and not miss the opportunity to add him to our squad
349687 this is not something thats going to give consumers short term relief and it is not a long term solution to our problems with fossil fuels generally and oil in particular
349688 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can
349689 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
349690 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock
349691 it would be the first oil free national park in europe and perhaps the first in the world
349692 it would also slash local emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that cause global warming
349693 if you are so unhappy with how you look why dont you do something about it
349694 whats another fucking seven years of bad luck who cares if it wasnt for bad luck id have no luck at all
349695 so men ought to love their wives as their own bodies
349696 god has given gifts to each of you from his great variety of spiritual gifts manage them well so that gods generousity can flow through you are you called to be a speaker then speak as though god himself were speaking through you are you called to help others do it with all the strength and energy that god supplies then god will be given glory in everything through jesus christ all glory and power belong to him forever and ever amen
349697 i think we put way to much emphasize on ayp and hitting the ayp target
349698 i would rather we all put our emphasis on growth on how much our kids on improving and on how much the schools we send our kids to are improving
349699 its the season im not going to sit in the house
349700 doc let me out of the hospital yesterday and i went up to see the guys on the fourth floor of kimsey center last night
349701 im real excited about the start of the season the kids have worked so hard through the spring they had an awesome summer the attitude is just different its so upbeat the kids are happy and theyre excited about getting going and i just feed off of that i feel good about where were going and what were trying to accomplish here i feel good about the players we have and getting started
349702 we had a good summer with training but nothing beats being on the field playing football we have the same energy level as last year but were more focused were a little more loose now were having fun wreaking havoc wherever we go were ready to put on pads running around and tagging thats all fun but defense isnt about tagging its about knocking someone out were waiting for that were waiting for when we can get pads on we still have a lot of work to do to get everyone to where they know their assignments cold but attitude right now were ready to hit somebody
349703 if the fuelwatch saga seems depressingly based on its ridiculous faith in government at least it is confined to only one industry we are only starting to come to terms with the big kahuna of inordinate faith in government the wonderfully renamed carbon pollution reduction scheme
349704 the signs were never good based on the foundations laid by garnaut
349705 occasionally the cost of a market failure will be less than the cost of government intervention with all of its political economy and other risks and costs but even in these cases regulatory or fiscal intervention by government may be required to ensure an optimal response
349706 twenty years ago governments finally recognised that even the best policies have unintended consequences those consequences undermine the certainty with which we can claim that interventions will make things better now however that recognition seems to have disappeared
349707 a good example surrounds the distortionary effects from various arbitrary thresholds built into the emissions trading scheme
349708 more than 99 per cent of all firms in australia will not need to be directly involved
349709 as we await the public release of yet more reports to the rudd government on grocery prices car assistance and innovation expect to hear even more about market failures wise intervention and government solutions to problems
349710 i really want to talk to you about energy i understand what it means to our families and our small businesses and people right here in this room to be paying high energy prices high gasoline prices like a tax ive worked hard to keep your taxes low our energy policy hasnt done a very good job of keeping your gasoline prices low and therefore its like paying a tax my whole philosophy of government by the way is yes weve obviously got some needs in washington d c the primary one is to make sure those who wear the uniform have the full support of the government of the united states of america
349711 with this legislation america is showing its tremendous regard for the dignity and worth of every human being this afternoon i want to speak directly to those around the world who have or think they may have hiv a positive diagnosis does not have to be a reason for shame so dont let shame keep you from getting tested or treated your life is treasured by the people who love you it is precious in the eyes of god it matters to the people of the united states
349712 we remain a nation at war al qaeda is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped forward to defend us they understand that we have no greater responsibility than to stop the terrorists before they launch another attack on our homeland and every day they make great sacrifices to keep the american people safe here at home we owe our thanks to all those who wear the uniform and their families who support them in their vital work and the best way to honor them is to support their mission and bring them home with victory
349713 i think there is a general lack of understanding that the eagle is a functioning operational unit
349714 there is a lack of awareness of the permanent crew which is here three hundred sixty five days a year during dry dock and freezing winters not just when were sailing the caribbean
349715 when we arent in the middle of a summer cruise we have more time to take care of our own damage control training and there is a tremendous amount of maintenance to be done
349716 during that six to nine month period the eagle is completely manned and maintained without the aid of the cadets
349717 unless theyre in the coast guard they really dont know about whats going on below decks
349718 we have the largest afloat dining facility in the coast guard when were underway
349719 for that dining facility you have to make water keep the lights on and when theres no wind youve got to make way somehow you cant just be left to the fates
349720 when we first got underway this summer we had to do a top end overhaul on the main diesel engine
349721 we got that and some problems with the valves behind us and its been running smooth ever since
349722 its a good feeling when youre teaching somebody something and you see them get what youre telling them it also helps me retain that knowledge because im using it everyday it makes everybody better
349723 in boot camp i was asked a few questions to ensure i was ready and certain i wanted to work in a teaching environment
349724 i arrived during the winter when there were no cadets aboard but was training them on watchstanding by summer i think its very beneficial for the cadets to interact with enlisted members throughout their training
349725 if youre in the coast guard and you want to train if you want to teach if you want to pass on what youve learned this is definitely the unit you want to come to
349726 youre pretty much bombarded with questions from the cadets as long as theyre willing to learn im willing to teach
349727 we have decided not to hold any talks with the governor over the amarnath land dispute as there is no blueprint to resolve the issue
349728 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit
349729 if we want to carry the saarcs economic and social agenda forward its essential that we manage to do this in an atmosphere free of violence
349730 oh how fun for the kids with lots of parental involvement

349735 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants indeed the committee itself has stated that the law is being used more liberally than parliament intended
349736 in my opinion the statistics and the committees comments over the years since the court of appeal made that observation do give rise to powerful misgivings about the lawfulness of many abortions they tend to confirm dr forsters view that new zealand essentially has abortion on request
349737 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants
349738 the approval rate for abortions seems remarkably high bearing in mind that under section 187a the consultants must form the good faith opinion that continuance of the pregnancy would result in serious danger to the mothers health
349739 it appears i have expressed a common feeling a shared view
349740 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
349741 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
349742 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
349743 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought

349805 kami merekomendasikan agar pemerintah tidak memberlakukan kebijakan eskalasi maupun penyesuaian volume atau nilai kontrak terhadap kontrak tahun tunggal tahun anggaran 2008 yang sumber dananya berasal dari apbn apbd
349806 tidak ada satu pun pasal yang mengatur eskalasi harga untuk kontrak tahun tunggal single years baik atas kenaikan harga bbm atau harga apa pun
349807 karena itu menurut penilaian kami dampak kenaikan harga bbm tanggal 23 mei lalu sama sekali belum mengakibatkan terjadinya kondisi kahar
349808 kan sudah diwacanakan 3 sampai 4 bulan sebelumnya jadi mereka harus bisa menyesuaikan
349809 padahal jelas di aturannya kita tidak bisa memberikan rekomendasi eskalasi pada proyek proyek tahun tunggal
349810 sedang secara sektoral mayoritas yang mengajukan eskalasi adalah yang bergerak di sektor konstruksi bangunan jalan raya dan energi
349811 of course we are happy that india is coming forward and offering some of its nuclear facilities for safeguards by the agency
349812 but at the same time we feel the nuclear non proliferation treaty is not being taken into account
349813 i know india is not happy at the fact that we are giving only half way support for this initiative
349814 but this is the case with most members of the iaea board
349815 at the end everyone will welcome india coming into the agencys arms as it were but most will be unhappy about the fact that it will now continue to remain outside the npt
349816 i think you will see at least 30 statements on friday
349817 it is true that that the iaea is not the place to talk about india and the npt but it provides the occasion so i have told the indian ambassador please dont be angry with me for saying india should follow the peaceful path and join the npt
349818 if the iaea wants to give such nuclear status to india we expect the same for pakistan
349819 and we are backing it because we see india as a unique case
349820 as this agreement gets implemented i think you will see plenty more indian facilities coming under safeguards and this is good for the non proliferation regime and good for pakistan
349821 if you ask me the one big thing which worries everyone is that this could be a precedent for other countries to come some day before the iaea and ask for a similar agreement including your neighbour
349822 i think pakistan will argue that the secretariat should include similar provisions in any safeguards agreement it negotiates with them
349823 india may argue that the conditions for placing an indigenous nuclear reactor under iaea inspections have never arrived and none of its own facilities may then come under safeguards for years
349824 india is offering its facilities for safeguards and the decision is its own
349825 i am not saying the indians are going back on that offer but then why have a safeguards agreement which is structured in such a way as to give them a way to back out should they so desire
349826 look when you want to block something you can always raise a procedural objection
349827 may be it would have been better to have had another 15 20 days but i think weve all had enough time
349828 some of the shades of the agreement are not so nice
349829 ever since i turned 35 the battle of the bulge has turned into a rout gut 1 patrick 0
349830 the syndrome is associated with eight degenerative diseases the first is overweight disorder then high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar then you have type two diabetes cardiovascular diseases heart attacks and strokes four kinds of cancer breast prostate colon endometrial osteoarthritis and finally gall bladder disease all this is basically because people eat too many carbohydrates thats partly because its the cheapest food and also because the food industry keeps throwing sugar into everything to make it taste good
349831 healthy cells contain proteins that span the entire charge spectrum from negatively charged proteins to positively charged protein health means that theres a balance between negatively charged proteins and positively charged proteins this is essential for core body health because the 25 000 proteins in the body are its worker bees
349832 the synthesis of negatively charged proteins continues but the synthesis of positively charged proteins is greatly diminished and this impairs cell function causing further disease all foods made in bulk in nature contain negatively charged proteins things like whey soy casein and egg white and when we get meat at the store its usually muscle which is also mainly negatively charged proteins
349833 unless of course you eat like your grandparents did tripe kidney or stomach you get much more of a protein balance from organ meat but people dont eat all that much of it anymore
349834 you could make up for a positively charged protein deficiency by eating protein with an overall negative charge
349835 eleven are nonessential meaning our body makes them and nine are essential meaning our body doesnt make them and we must get them from our diets as we age there are two things that prevent us from getting those essential amino acids we fall into poor eating habits taking in lots of carbohydrates and less protein rich food and also the aging process interferes with the digestive process leading to further deficiencies in amino acids and positively charged proteins i call this the food chain gap
349836 by the end of the first week you have more pep and energy
349837 reset the metabolic pathways and thats why you get more pep and energy plus it burns calories they can even improve mood three of those amino acids are direct precursors to neurotransmitters in the brain two of them are dopamine and serotonin which are related to pleasure this means they can also relieve stress anxiety mood swings and depression because they reach the brain within minutes the amino acids also signal the brains appetite centers that the body is well fed and that leads to feelings of comfort satisfaction and well being

349848 cerebral palsy may result in an inconvenience when it comes to raising a child but it is manageable
349849 due to shyloes unwillingness to care for a child with special needs destiny lost her life
349850 this whole field is highly contested because its mixed up with the issue of abortion this kind of case can bring out a lot of deep deep emotions so its hard to think through on a legal basis
349851 destiny suffered severe brain hemorrhaging and brain damage but she certainly was not brain dead by any definition she was able to move around

349867 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what are the repercussions for this event

349869 there is a huge market for family focused games particularly for girls in the 6 12 age range and we expect our hand picked titles to stand out in retail due to unique positioning and strong licensed endorsements

349886 carbon monoxide poisoning fatalities are at least two to three times greater than hospitalizations illustrating how severe exposure can be we need to do all we can to educate families about how to protect themselves and getting alarms into families hands is a great start
349887 i cant overemphasize the need to be specific concrete and clear this is the most commonly fallen into pothole in writing
349888 carbon monoxide poisoning isnt something that families often think about yet as firefighters we see firsthand how lethal it can be every year we respond to poisonings especially when the weather gets colder co awareness week is a great time for us to educate families about this silent killer

349890 ibiblio wasnt the big idea that would get featured in the ny times but it brings in everything and puts into practice
349891 what has been hardest about taking a new idea and turning it into a successful business
349892 to be a successful entrepreneur or anything for that matter it is all about learning
349893 how do you keep it up and what drives you
349894 your family is more important than your work you may have to work 16 hours a day but you have to communicate with them and let them know they are the priority

349901 a leader in demonstrating that awesome design can be applied to relatively inexpensive common items consider the sensor it redifined womens shaving and we thought we had seen the last word for men the mach3 turned out to be very special very different
349902 hey i dont get along with this person so im not going
349903 he was given that oil immediately but within an hour he became unconscious he was rushed to the hospital but nothing happened doctors said it was severe reaction of the medicine

349911 with immense sadness we inform that our commander in chief manuel marulanda v lez died march 26 of a heart attack in the arms of his companion and surrounded by his personal guard
349912 our struggle continues without rest until we reach the objective of a new colombia a great latin american fatherland and socialism
349913 the farc is going through a process of decomposition and defeat
349914 they will fracture you already see it in the command and control structures its option is to look for a way to bring the conflict to an end
349915 there has to be an allocation of land to those who need it and will work it
349916 i told them use your imagination be audacious and catch the enemy off guard
349917 i said be creative so we can land an out of the ordinary blow
349918 its a very hard blow against the guerrillas the latest of many delivered all this year
349919 there are too many things that have totally changed the reality of the situation here
349920 creating catastrophe inside the farc and that catastrophe is going to lead to defeat
349921 weve had dictatorships governments of ultra right and ultra left
349922 but there has never been a problem between the government and the media like with this administration
349923 we believe that justice requires that all those people who have defrauded their clients and the state answer with their assets
349924 for nine years the isa as family has had an enormous control over the politics the authorities over the judges
349925 and this has prevented us from acting until very recently
349926 hes combative hes impulsive and he didnt like the courts decision
349927 its him saying im going to show you how popular i am how loved i am thats the refuge for him the people
349928 generate constitutional or legal legitimacy reason by which the court orders this sentence to go to the constitutional court and the inspector general of the nation
349929 criminalization will only apply in cases where the possession of narcotics for personal consumption represents a danger for the public health of others
349930 this criterion fits in well with the laws of more civilized nations
349931 i believe that with this the sense of a broadening of freedom is respected
349932 absurdity that we would have more regulations for smokers of tobacco than for consumers of cocaine
349933 imagine how bad it could be if the state were to renounce even further its punitive power
349934 understand that now is not the hour to shed more blood its time to lay down those weapons and exchange them for roses
349935 there is repudiation of an organization that causes pain and suffering when theres no justified reason or cause
349936 the ideal would be for the farc to liberate the hostages unconditionally
349937 that would be logical but their thinking is counterintuitive i believe that they do not have the same logic as we do
349938 its easy with mccain hes clearly going to pursue without exceptions the bush administration line including the policy toward cuba
349939 the democrats are kind of a mystery theyll want to loosen things and they wont want to fight with everybody like bush did
349940 i am encouraged by our better relations and i will do everything i can to continue our path of cooperation and better relations with all nations in our hemisphere
349941 hes been to the amazon rain forest hes been to the galapagos islands so for him the relationship with our southern neighbors is not just a series of briefings by an outside policy adviser because he needed to have a policy position on latin america
349942 its very hard to argue youre going to pay more attention to a region youve never bothered to visit
349943 this is close to a miracle i was certain that some things will not happen in my lifetime
349944 a black president of the u s will mean that there will be more american tolerance for people around the world who are different
349945 the primaries showed that the u s is actually the nation we had believed it to be a place that is open minded enough to have a woman or an african american as its president
349946 obama is the exciting image of what we always hoped america was
349947 we have immensely enjoyed the ride and cant wait for the next phase
349948 although no one will admit it israeli leaders are worried about obama
349949 the feeling is that this is the time to be tough in foreign policy toward the middle east and hes going to be soft
349950 the farc wants combatants because they are qualified structured people who have major knowledge in explosives and technical know how about combat and urban work
349951 the farc has a great investment in the jails and the farc wants to reactivate 1 000 qualified combatants
349952 even if they have been convicted they can demonstrate their desire to demobilize
349953 we have to see how much they say how much they admit to how much they turn in
349954 a venezuelan whos highly humanistic with solidarity who knows his history who knows the venezuelan indian who knows all the resources the fatherland has who knows the history of oil about why were so dependent about why were underdeveloped
349955 the curriculum is more about ideology than about shaping citizens
349956 venezuelan society has been steadfast in opposing the educational reform and on the implantation of models that inject our children with ideology
349957 those who criticize shouldnt just criticize but provide ideas of course were moving ahead on this but were open to debate
349958 this is a question of conscience this is a company that has to have a socialist focus
349959 he said i have good news theyre selling a company
349960 i reviewed the characteristics of the company and i said lets not waste a day
349961 we are not going to give in we will fight
349962 the autonomy statute has as its center of gravity the attempt to exercise absolute control over the policy of landownership in the region
349963 it is an explicit move to try to create an independent state
349964 if my client is wondering if a pair of socks made in medellin will make it to the u s duty free this time next year they will just go to central america
349965 its part of the lies that are spread around every day against what we are doing
349966 what they show is that the level of cooperation was much more than what we had earlier estimated
349967 we knew there was a level of cooperation but not as intense not as close and not as effective as were now seeing
349968 this paper has been on the verge of closing several times and it has always found a way to get ahead and stay open history repeats itself
349969 thats what people say papers are closing and look what these crazy guys are doing
349970 its a reality and you cant block the sun with your hands
349971 dont tell us you are not terrorists show us that youre not terrorists let those other hostages come home
349972 the most perfect rescue that has ever been executed in the history of the world
349973 sustained me through the most difficult ordeal of my life
349974 i dont have a drivers license how am i going to get home
349975 almost 5 1 2 years ago we fell off the edge of the earth
349976 were doing well but we cannot forget those we left behind in captivity
349977 right now theyre being punished because we got rescued successfully
349978 we have been victims of their hate of their abuse and of their torture
349979 i have seen how even their own guerrillas commit suicide in a desperate attempt to escape the slavery that the farc has condemned them to
349980 president fujimori has no responsibility in the matters of this case
349981 fujimori and montesinos have already cut a deal he defended his old boss and obviously expects something in return
349982 nirvana paradise that must be very similar to what i feel at this moment
349983 some foreign military analysts said this operation could have only been done by the best of the best in the world
349984 god this is a miracle such a perfect operation is unprecedented
349985 we went dashing back to the house and there it was on cnn
349986 we cant really react right now its just all too emotional
349987 i congratulate president uribe the military the nation of colombia this is great news
349988 all the other innocent people who are being held hostage
349989 i would remind you that these things require incredibly long planning and coordination et cetera theres no way possible that it could have had anything to do with our visit that i could imagine its a very happy moment
349990 i think the timing was fortuitous they just felt they had it ready to implement
349991 i think it was a sign of confidence of president uribe and the defense minister in senator mccain and maybe in the two of us that they were prepared to share this information last night which was highly classified
349992 protocol is not a word i would associate with this
349993 i would leave the modalities to the government of colombia
349994 but i intend to do everything i can do to support an increase in their capabilities
349995 id really go for some kind of military dictator like juan per n
349996 this type of program causes great harm because the disappearances are still an open wound here
349997 the most serious blow that this terrorist group has suffered
349998 if he has died his presence has not been in vain for the great fatherland of bol var
349999 he could be useful in a process if the colombian government and the farc enter into talks but it would have to be a different ch vez
