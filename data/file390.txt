3900012 he said to me whenever you go to bed recite ayat al kursi from the beginning to the end allahu la ilaha illa huwa lhaiy ul qaiyum
3900013 he really spoke the truth although he is an absolute liar do you know whom you were talking to these three nights o abu huraira
3900014 i had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two sas of it for one sa of barni dates in order to give it to the prophet to eat
3900015 beware beware this is definitely riba usury this is definitely riba usury dont do so but if you want to buy a superior kind of dates sell the inferior dates for money and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money

3900019 an honest treasurer who gives what he is ordered to give fully perfectly and willingly to the person to whom he is ordered to give is regarded as one of the two charitable persons
3900020 two years ago i had decided to add a ccf fund pcrix to my asset allocation but i was not able to add it then with required minimum without affecting the overall desired allocation in the portfolio
3900021 1 you have waited two years whats the hurry wait another year and go without the insurance really ccf being so high now its likely not providing much insurance anyway
3900022 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3900023 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
3900024 i think she should definitely get paid as much as shannen and i are getting paid
3900025 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3900026 10 000 20 000 per episode while her co stars garth and doherty were getting between

3900030 we came out today and they were tired and sore
3900031 this was a character practice we had a pretty good practice i had to push them but thats my job i told them im going to get every ounce of energy and every ounce of talent out of them
3900032 i want to get a flow of the game going i want to make it like a game and get game conditions for them
3900033 made just about every play we couldnt block him he was like howie long
3900034 we are lucky to have two guys of that quality playing for us
3900035 moses is playing pretty good and moten is giving us a pass rusher
3900036 i asked her do you need help she said yes
3900037 we said let the girl go and well leave we told them stop
3900038 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her i got a bottle smashed over my head and after that i started fighting but i got beat down
3900039 when i showed up there were a lot of people there people on the left and people on the right and then boom i got hit and passed out
3900040 those in the crowd were yelling hey white boys youre in the hood now
3900041 i love the ronsons theyre close to my heart and i respect all the work they do samantha and my relationship is a private matter
3900042 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up

3900047 we arent sure if it is the batman effect or what but sales to men have been going through the roof
3900048 men have begun to dominate the hosiery market once owned by women
3900049 it has nothing to do with being gender confused or gay as the bulk of wearers are straight men in long term relationships
3900050 the trend continued until about the end of the 19th century when the womenfolk stole the idea for themselves
3900051 with energy prices going up and up i think were going to see even more men around the world wearing these products
3900052 when im doing my tricks my hair doesnt whack me in the face
3900053 i have so many women who cut their hair to fit into a ponytail and what happens is that they all look the same instead of having a style
3900054 it drives me crazy these are the same people who say i look terrible in short hair well im looking at you in a ponytail and you have short hair
3900055 if you want to wear a ponytail just grab a little piece of hair from underneath wrap it around the elastic bobby pin it and give it some style
3900056 pull your hair back throw your chin to the ceiling and pull it back again
3900057 now that russia has humiliated georgia with a punishing military offensive it
3900058 i dont think at this point it is necessarily a question i can answer right now
3900059 we havent even started on that part of the show
3900060 the answer to that is i would be inclined to be quite transparent about it
3900061 to which restaurant can i take a teenage girl in paris
3900062 it is bizarre that while people need a resource consent to alter their homes even in a minor way telecommunications companies can erect 12 to 22 metre cell towers around new zealand without needing any resource consent or even to consult with the local community

3900073 todos los negocios tienen que incorporar el concepto gratis para sobrevivir
3900074 hay tres tipos de mercados gratis est el marketing gratuito del tipo
3900075 internet es una econom a m s grande que la de muchos pa ses y se sustenta casi completamente en entregar productos y servicios de forma gratuita por ejemplo todo lo que se hace en google es gratis y sin embargo google es una de las compa as con m s rentabilidad del mundo
3900076 la cola larga fue un fen meno que naci gracias a la gratuidad ya que la distribuci n de cosas a un costo cero permiti tener una gran variedad de productos o una cola larga de oferta
3900077 todos los negocios tienen que incorporar el concepto gratis para sobrevivir es decir buscar una manera de hacer algo de lo que hacen a costo cero por ejemplo si alguien es un agente de viajes l puede transformar su negocio a software y lo puede hacer gratis lo mismo puede hacer un corredor de bolsa por lo que la mejor manera de transformar un negocio para que sea gratis es convertirlo en software
3900078 todos los negocios tendr n que tener una estrategia gratis alguna manera de usar la palabra gratis de dar sus productos de forma gratuita o competir con compa as que dan sus productos de manera gratuita todas las compa as tendr n que hacerlo porque es hacia all donde van los consumidores
3900079 la compa a que mejor lo ha hecho hasta el minuto con este modelo de negocio es google pero tambi n est n haciendo dinero los medios que no cobr n a sus consumidores sino a los avisadores y los perdedores son las personas que compiten con lo gratis por ejemplo los sitios web de m sica online han hecho que las compa as discogr ficas pierdan participaci n de mercado
3900080 al contrario este negocio la incentiva y tiende a crecer el n mero de artistas y posibilidades por ejemplo youtube con sus videos gratis ha hecho que haya m s productores de pel culas m s personas creando contenido lo mismo con la distribuci n de m sica gratuita en internet que ha permitido que haya m s artistas ya que hay audiencias m s grandes por ejemplo my space ha favorecido el nacimiento de cantantes ya que puede encontrar audiencias para ellos m s f cilmente
3900081 no mandatory rules exist explicitly for arctic or antarctic navigation
3900082 i need mandatory codes i need certain rules that ships need to apply to operate in arctic or antarctic waters
3900083 i fear it is only a question of time before we have an accident on our hands
3900084 the danger of any kind of ship accident in the arctic is we wont be able to clean up the mess
3900085 our ability to clean oil spills is limited by the amount of ice in the water its extremely important that ships are well equipped for arctic conditions
3900086 the wishes of john steinbeck related to ownership of his literary works have been validated

3900102 i think he does and adequate job jumping and he does a great job on the board
3900103 i do not stand before you to make excuses for what was undoubtedly a flawed and an imperfect investigation
3900104 but having said that it was not done deliberately it was not done for a sinister motive it was not done to give derek harvey zenk a break at all
3900105 its unfair to expect that those in attendance at this kind of get together would be monitoring each others alcohol consumption
3900106 its not realistic no one is focused on others drinking and im not just talking about numbers of drinks
3900107 there is certainly no evidence of any coverup or any thin blue line being in place
3900108 chief bakema was outside with zenk he was not in a warm confined space
3900109 its extremely urgent the canadian government reinforce with saudi officials at the highest levels of the need to ensure that all evidence is heard
3900110 if that is done theres no doubt in anyones mind that the two will be exonerated
3900111 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
3900112 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
3900113 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
3900114 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
3900115 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
3900116 weve been here since monday afternoon at 12 so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
3900117 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
3900118 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
3900119 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
3900120 i perceived they were taking us away from rehabilitation and therapeutic programing and deeper into policy that was more about containment
3900121 women didnt use bad language around the children they were gentle
3900122 she wouldnt be here with me i wouldnt be where i am i would probably be out using still
3900123 because if she was taken from me from the beginning i would miss that bond
3900124 our staff are not trained to supervise infants and theyre not trained in infant first aid or anything
3900125 if something went wrong and we didnt respond appropriately we just couldnt risk putting an infant in that situation
3900126 theyll give birth to their child in a hospital theyll go back to jail and go back to the stuff theyve know before
3900127 i stepped up to the plate you know like was i going to do this or not was i going to get on with this or not
3900128 even when i wanted to screw up i had to think about something other than myself
3900129 a lot of healing went on for me in the six months i was in there with those babies
3900130 these children that are allowed to be there are the focus of much love and care and attention
3900131 i have been encouraged by the direction weve been going in
3900132 im happy theyre doing it but i know that it will be gone after november
3900133 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks

3900164 colin barnett has no policies after a whole week in the campaign its about time he was put under some pressure
3900165 clearly the greens are a rising force across australia in the northern territory we saw the greens get 15 per cent of the vote we do determine which government goes into power by our preferences and native forest logging is going to be one of the important considerations in our decision about who to support
3900166 i do think that there is a unified voice across the conservation movement that native forest logging must stop and that we must make a complete transfer to plantations and farmed forestry
3900167 microsoft steve ballmer is famous for a crazy video in which he yells
3900168 i believe that the goal of maximizing is a source of great dissatisfaction that it can make people miserable especially in a world that insists on providing and overwhelming number of choices both trivial and not so trivial
3900169 people with high maximization scores experienced less satisfaction with life were less happy were less optimistic and were more depressed than people with low maximization scores
3900170 success is liking yourself liking what you do and liking how you do it
3900171 the man who knows he has enough is a rich man learn from the past plan for the future but live in the present
3900172 if you believe that feeling bad or worrying long enough will change a past or future event then you are residing on another planet with a different reality system
3900173 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow

3900178 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3900179 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3900180 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3900181 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this

3900203 the government has a pledge to the community to have 4 400 full time equivalent officers on the beat by 2010
3900204 take attrition into the equation they need to recruit some 700 in the next 18 months clearly theyll fail to do that
3900205 were coming off the tail end of probably one of the most bizarre complex and challenging set of economic circumstances to hit australia in the last 15 years
3900206 all the indicators that we see both in terms of a sustainable sense and economic sense indicate that there is light at the end of the tunnel and its not a train
3900207 primarily this is going to impact upon the hospitality services area theres a lot of itinerant workers who come and go with the season and these are unfortunately the jobs which are probably most likely to be impacted upon
3900208 personally i think that its the casual area where there is going to be the impact heavily felt but in an optimistic sense going forward the industry does have a range of programs to combat this
3900209 probably due to perhaps a few different reasons you know the labs can now detect very minute traces of chemical also the recent flood events certainly may have had some impact in washing chemicals off
3900210 and this time of year it is a time when the pesticides 2 4d and mcpa are widely used for the control of emerging weeds
3900211 this has been a long time in the making and the planning weve had some problems getting the station built due to the wet weather but its a great day today
3900212 im with the police commissioner and were very pleased that finally weve been able to deliver this police station its really the last police station on any of the discreet aboriginal communities in queensland
3900213 we are investigating to see whether a connex employee or someone from the public tried to close those doors
3900214 we have cctv inside the train itself and on the platform and so we will be able to do a full investigation
3900215 we are not going to act precipitously or recklessly this is public money
3900216 i am concerned that over the next say six months we will probably see a lot of people moving out of the area
3900217 this is a problem for the local community because youre going to see workers and their families leave the community if they cant get jobs and employment into the future
3900218 so the question is how long will it take for these payments to kick in into this community
3900219 this community could have run its own sawmill and provided really long term decent futures and career paths for people who have got a commitment in the timber industry now
3900220 i think its an opportunity lost that the bartlett government and federal labor have failed to identify i think people will feel very dudded by the government over this
3900221 mortgage defaulters are coming into the market and seeking accommodation in a market thats already depressed
3900222 that is going to add additional stress to the market and very very unfortunately i guess additional stress to the mortgage defaulters who have already had a considerable amount of upheaval in their lives already
3900223 then i knocked on the window of the house and opened the front door and just yelled at them to get out

3900240 pete and i are very aware of the problems people are having in michigan and feel we should give something back for all the support we have had over the last 40 years
3900241 n o acho que h muito para o united evoluir tiveram muitos jogadores no m ximo rendimento nas duas ltimas temporadas
3900242 um jogador que pode atuar em algumas fun es diferentes
3900243 um jogador que pode atuar em algumas fun es diferentes vamos precisar achar outro atleta com essa caracter stica para essas pr ximas semanas

3900245 i am on the dirt frontage road to the internet thingy
3900246 people would say oh theyre nibbling away theyre nibbling away
3900247 and we would always say well they can nibble but theyre never gonna really take us and then they took us
3900248 within the wide berth of comedy and drama as prospective brands were looking at where there are underserved audiences and were finding them in family viewers african americans women and action lovers
3900249 there are an awful lot of channels available to people in the average digital home
3900250 so if you dont stand for something you stand for nothing
3900251 appeals to people with a certain taste for edgy innovative quality
3900252 fx toyed in its earlier incarnations with various branding strategies
3900253 from live television its original motto was tv made fresh daily to a time when it was much more explicitly appealing to men
3900254 the great thing about our shows is people want to see them again
3900255 a lot of times well premiere an episode of top chef and then rerun the episode right when its over and people stay tuned some of our shows are really like crack
3900256 the finance guys say youre killing me and the programming guys say yeah but if i put on repeats theyre going to have terrible ratings and well have no promo base for fall and everybodys right
3900257 you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but you havent got much choice there
3900258 i am surprised but not that surprised given the turmoil in the air force
3900259 it makes sense for new leadership to want to pause and evaluate major projects like cyber command before moving forward the air force is facing severe challenges right now so leadership may want to consolidate its resources before expanding the af cybermission
3900260 first one to crash north koreas electrical grid gets 100k and their body weight of the energy drink of their choice
3900261 with this proposal jon caldara is building an interesting relationship between the lets drown government in a bathtub folks and gay activists
3900262 unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3900263 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally
3900264 both services can operate on adjacent spectrum without causing substantial interference
3900265 never before has a virtual character been signed to a worldwide recording contract
3900266 von johin is legendary in the virtual community second life for his heart pounding live shows
3900267 it was a hard decision but von johin is the real deal he is original and plays from his heart
3900268 just the man and his guitar with just these two instruments and a virtual appeal like no other he brings crowds to their feet daily
3900269 filling up on bbq cornbread greens and all the fixins with a glass of coca cola or some sweet honey nectar of the gods sweet iced tea by his side
3900270 von as an avatar will play all his shows in second life and theyll continue to be free
3900271 as for touring von is already playing a fully booked schedule but reality is planning a big in world event in addition to that
3900272 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that its sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected
3900273 the neoconned bush regime and the israeli occupied american media are heading the innocent world toward nuclear war
3900274 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
3900275 scheunemann was best known as one of the neoconservatives who engineered the war in iraq when he was a director of the project for a new american century
3900276 now im gonna have to listen to progressives say that russia invaded another country because conservatives manipulated it into doing it damn those american conservatives are omnipotent
3900277 destroy what remains of the wasp power structure in the us
3900278 there is no imaginable excuse for russias invasion of georgia
3900279 totally disagree with the times editorial affixing almost all the blame for this conflict to the russians
3900280 for mccain to so fervently embrace scheunemanns neoconservative line of demonizing russia in the interest of appearing tough during an election campaign is a reminder that a senator can be old and yet wildly irresponsible
3900281 i think these records wont be broken in two years
3900282 i want to show all my strength during the competition if someone broke it i would go out to snatch the record back
3900283 obviously lius results are impressive there is no doubt about that
3900284 this is in china i am not surprised with the results the chinese lifters showed high level in previous competitions and today is another demonstration
3900285 everyone had much pressure in the olympics thats why i lifted a lower weight in beijing
3900286 i failed at my third attempt in athens which was a regret for four years
3900287 but today i upgraded the world record to 286kg i have no regrets anymore
3900288 i had to stop training and competing for long time
3900289 i was afraid i would lose the feeling of competition
3900290 i was happy that i won the silver medal i had stopped training for nearly a year and missed the asian games i am quite satisfied that i won the a medal after i recovered from a serious injury
3900291 more important was that i found the rhythm and confidence for the beijing olympics
3900292 it is exciting to take part in the olympics in my home country and it is fantastic that i won the gold medal
3900293 i am not sure about the future but i will have a good rest and go to see my parents
3900294 i am on the dirt frontage road to the internet thingy
3900295 this is an extension of our ability to load balance and manage cpu resources
3900296 it monitors resource utilization in the servers and the user can set a threshold so if they see a server being used less than 50 percent the user can start to look for places to move those workloads those virtual machines onto other servers with the target of shutting that physical server down once they have moved the virtual machines off
3900297 you have to look at things like the development perspective and what this all means for developers and hows this change the game
3900298 weve provided competition in a market that desperately needed competition
3900299 from a silverlight perspective this is an amazing opportunity to demonstrate whats possible with the technology this puts a stake in the ground and saying were here this may be the single biggest online event and microsoft is empowering it
3900300 when you think about the size and scope of all this its kind of mind boggling
3900301 the key thing here is this is the first time people have had competition
3900302 thank you so much for the awesomely complete coverage you are providing on all of the equestrian activities at the 2008 olympic games we horse people are fanatics just like many other sports followers and have felt a little left out in years past but we understand that most americans dont care about equestrian and that it air time is precious and that it doesnt make good business sense to spend much air time on a mostly unknown or little understood sport
3900303 i dont think gm when it announced this car had any idea how big it would become
3900304 ive always believed that by the time the car was produced wed have 100 000 people waiting for one now i think that might be low
3900305 this is about what the car represents and thats really struck a chord
3900306 weve always been committed to making this an affordable car so we can sell it in volume
3900307 at amp t may have had 10 000 users in downtown and the cell site may have been engineered to handle that many calls but with this phenomenal buying there are now 20 000 people out there that have at amp t service on the 3g iphone
3900308 the new iphone is performing very well on our network
3900309 customer experience on the iphone 3g or any device can vary based on a number of factors including the proximity to the cell site buildings trees terrain and the number of people on the network at any given time
3900310 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3900311 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3900312 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3900313 no surprise that as soon as theres a big outage everyone howls this happens with corporate networks and e mail systems and applications too of course the real question is which is more reliable
3900314 yes we noticed the outage but the hassles are acceptable e mail does today go down from time to time whether its from google or an in house service such as exchange or notes domino thats a price to pay that most users including us are prepared to pay overall we continue to feel that gmail provides an excellent service
3900315 nuncevedo attastoni avanzo ma stancampana che se te piio te spanzo
3900316 we believe the advantages of cobs as a feedstock provide the fastest route to commercialization
3900317 americas corn belt has enough cobs to produce 5 billion gallons of ethanol per year
3900318 in a post 9 11 era that were living in we all need to connect and work as law enforcement together
3900319 weve had incidents where weve had migrant landings in this area and weve have to pretty much run our operations out of the east coast
3900320 we are part of the coast guard stationed in fort myers beach which is 45 miles north of here so its quite a distance to get down here is something does happen
3900321 marco island is in a pivotal location as far as more law enforcement operation in and around collier county and points south
3900322 let me put it to you this way well have what we need
3900323 para un campe n como t no es nada te esperamos ver pronto toda la afici n americanista reza por tu salud

3900326 los testigos indicaron que el sospechoso pidi ver al presidente del partido ingres al edificio y poco despu s se escucharon tres disparos de arma de fuego
3900327 el sospechoso huy en un veh culo y fue perseguido por la polic a
3900328 hubo un incidente en la sede del partido y el presidente gwatney fue llevado al hospital
3900329 estamos aturdidos y afectados por el tiroteo de hoy en la sede del partido dem crata en arkansas donde nuestro buen amigo y compa ero dem crata bill gwatney fue herido
3900330 solo un l der de peso dentro del partido dem crata en arkansas sino que tambi n un amigo muy querido
3900331 thats what i love about these high school girls man i get older they stay the same age
3900332 the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly
3900333 religions of great intensity often confine themselves to condemning destroying or at best pitying what is not themselves burckhardt
3900334 is like a great flood that will be sure to overflow
3900335 if a doctrine and the particular religion it supports is not unintelligible it has to be vague and if neither unintelligible nor vague it has to be unverifiable why else would one have to get to heaven or the distant future to determine the truth of an effective doctrine when some part of a doctrine is relatively simple there is a tendency among the yoos guys to complicate and obscure it simple words are made pickwickian and pregnant with meaning and made to look like symbols in a secret message ergo there is this illiterate air about the most literate true believer
3900336 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3900337 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
3900338 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3900339 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions
3900340 barack obama is blatantly trying to cover up his infanticide votes
3900341 the heartlessness and callousness of this individual needs to be exposed the vast majority of americans care about protecting human life
3900342 the tiny newborn baby made very little noise as he struggled to breathe he lacked the strength to cry he had been born four months premature at that age says nurse jill stanek their lungs havent matured stanek is the nurse who found herself cradling this baby in her hands for all of his 45 minute lifetime he was close to ten inches long and weighed perhaps half a pound its just a guess no one had weighed or measured him at birth no happy family had been there to welcome him into the world no one was trying to save his life now putting him into an incubator giving him oxygen or nourishment he had just been left to die
3900343 most people whatever their view on abortion agree that the constitution at least guarantees the rights of born and living human beings
3900344 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3900345 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3900346 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3900347 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3900348 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3900349 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3900350 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3900351 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3900352 classes are full as more and more people are wanting to sell their personal items for extra money on ebay
3900353 with high gas and food prices and a slow economy ebay is a great way to reach millions of buyers that will pay cash for your unused items
3900354 additionally a recent ebay nielsen survey discovered that the average u s household has 52 unused items around the house originally worth 3 100 meaning almost everyone can find existing unused items they can sell to generate additional income when the going gets tough the tough sell on ebay
3900355 our research has shown that the local business climate is one key factor in fostering entrepreneurs
3900356 ebay clearly offers everyone additional opportunities to start grow and maintain a business whether theyre looking to market globally or simply to earn additional income in the current economic climate
3900357 im getting more and more calls from business wanting to learn how to sell on ebay and put their products online and from individuals wanting to start a part or full time business selling on ebay
3900358 what is this bitch talking about im on ugly betty you know a show that people actually watch on a network that will exist past next year

3900360 the gateway p 7811fx is a great choice for customers such as students and professionals who want a notebook that can handle all of their computing needs from creating videos and playing games to tackling work school and home projects
3900361 and while the new notebook is ideal for demanding gamers and enthusiasts who want the latest technology its affordable price also makes it perfect for digital media hobbyists and casual pc game players
3900362 if you ask matt about it hell give you the history of his back since he was 11

3900364 the reason we have formed this national strategic joint venture is to create a national footprint and to create national synergies
3900365 there is a heavy amount of layers in the show its super conceptual and labor intensive
3900366 i combine several elements ceramics sculpture metals and performance art one prop will drip unfiltered honey from several sacks the thin lines of dripping honey will record the action happening in the gallery space any movement will shift the lines and create a mark on the ground
3900367 i visited a restaurant in new york city max brenner chocolate by the bald man and i became inspired
3900368 people life experiences stories and food all these are fleeting temporary things its a completely encompassed experience i would like to get the same sensations from my work
3900369 its breaking down traditional ideas of how to act in a gallery space dont touch that dont break that
3900370 everythings temporary things will break the ice will melt the milk will spoil the honey will harden
3900371 there is a great deal of sexual connotation by opposing the social views and structures of male and female
3900372 in the show i will be strapping down my breasts and adding other subtle elements of masculine characteristics i exaggerate the masculine and feminine characteristics in myself
3900373 manipulating elements in the cones becomes almost sexual one cone is representative of a phallus and the other a vagina they embody both sexes making them almost sexless
3900374 in addition video will be shot from five angles to create the whole art piece
3900375 the video for me becomes the art piece the view it creates is almost like looking into a bee hive
3900376 forty hours of training and traveling a week helped me to do this
3900377 and like soccer there is a tremendous amount of physical demand and labor for one outcome after two years of work after the performance its done its finished which adds to the temporariness of it
3900378 art is a physicality of senses a series of processes amongst limitless materials
3900379 it is an ever changing form that i see taste smell touch and sense it takes me to a higher level which i hope to bring to others a deeper look
3900380 its not that big a deal on aug 12 in the eighth inning of an 8 2 ballgame
3900381 but what if you do something like that in a postseason game and it ends up costing you a series this is just unacceptable once the ball goes over the fence you can barrel roll around the bases if you want but wait till it gets over the fence please
3900382 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no need for that
3900383 i apologized to piniella and i apologized to my teammates
3900384 i said to them thats not going to happen again
3900385 i dont know what they want to do to get the pitcher thrown out
3900386 but its part of the game i dont want to be fighting with someone because thats not me
3900387 we have some pitchers who can do some other things too if they do it to us why cant we do it to them
3900388 its part of the game but you cant throw up at someones head
3900389 thats more part of the game than anything you dont throw at anyones faces or head thats dangerous im sure what he did was wrong and thats part of the game too
3900390 im sure its a situation that doesnt need to be resolved that way if you want to throw at somebody you have to keep the ball down thats the bottom line but they were ticked off and im sure bueno was embarrassed but still you cant throw at a guys head
3900391 the taking charge results illustrate the publics hostility towards the credit card industry

3900405 its mischievous for business groups to link the slowdown in economic conditions with the restoration of rights at work
3900406 on the contrary concern about job losses underlines the importance of having strong protections for workers entitlements and a good faith bargaining system that provides both certainty and injects shared growth into the economy
3900407 any businessperson worth their salt should recognise that the best way of achieving high productivity and profits is through a co operative relationship with your workforce not the nasty hostile approach of work choices

3900430 its nice to be able to communicate with someone again i think its being on nearly the same wavelength that creates such a bond and even when it looked like things were on the brink just being open and honest worked out usually you can sense when people have grown apart or know that they just arent worth your time but for the first time since i can remember it feels as if there has been this same force from both sides holding on which of course doesnt make any sense physically but with each theres a and in this case seems interlocking like putting two combs together or a key to a lock have my keys im too drunk to drive let the positive energies flow
3900431 my sperm ies deserve a gold medal because they can swim faster than michael phelps
3900432 ifc had acquired three titles previously and their ratings surprised the channel
3900433 three foreign women employees of irc international rescue committee and their local driver were killed in this ambush by the opposition forces
3900434 i knew you were someone special you just caught my eye
3900435 i believed that i could make it if i just kept moving
3900436 i seen them take those stunners theyre about as long as a yard stick and shove it up the hogs ass they do it with cows too and in their ears their eyes down their throat theyll be squealing and theyll just shove it right down there
3900437 hogs get stressed out pretty easy if you prod them too much they have heart attacks if you get a hog in a chute thats had the shit prodded out of him and has a heart attack or refuses to move you take a meat hook and hook it into his bunghole anus youre dragging these hogs alive and a lot of times the meat hook rips out of the bunghole ive seen hams thighs completely ripped open ive also seen intenstines come out if the hog collapses near the front of the chute you shove the meat hook into his cheek and drag him forward
3900438 or in their mouth the roof of their mouth and theyre still alive
3900439 pigs have come up to me on the kill floor and nuzzled me like a puppy two minutes later i had to kill them beat them to death with a pipe
3900440 these hogs get up to the scalding tank hit the water and start screaming and kicking sometimes they thrash so much that they kick water out of the tank sooner or later they drown theres a rotating arm the pushes them under no chance for them to get out im not sure if they burn to death before they drown but it takes a couple of minutes for them to stop thrashing
3900441 sometimes i grab it a hog by the ear and stick it right through the eye im not just taking its eye out ill go all the way up through the hilt to the brain and wiggle the knife
3900442 only you dont just kill it you go in hard push hard blow the windpipe make it drown in its own blood split its nose i live hog would be running around the pit it would be looking up at me and id me sticking and i would just take my knife and cut its eye out while it was just sitting there and this hog would just scream
3900443 one time i took my knife its sharp enough and i sliced off the end of a hogs nose just like a piece of bologna the hog went crazy for a few seconds then it just sat there looking kind of stuipd so i took a handful of salt brine and ground it into his nose now the hog went really nuts pushing its nose all over the place i still had a bunch of salf left in my hand i was wearing a rubber glove and i stuck the salt right up the hogs ass the poor hog didnt know whether to shit or go blind

3900484 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3900485 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3900487 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3900488 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3900489 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3900490 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3900498 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3900499 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3900500 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3900510 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3900511 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3900512 ive heard he said something do to about losing a job he didnt threaten anyone
3900513 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded
3900514 bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3900515 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
3900516 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3900517 it brought me comfort and i thought about it a lot
3900518 he was the master of the word and wisdom the symbol who expressed our national feeling our human constitution our declaration of independence
3900519 we loved him he was a poet and true palestinian patriot
3900520 he lived the whole palestinian life from 1948 until now
3900521 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3900522 not only a strong chairman of grant county south of the capital and apprehended after being shot police fired at the man but it wasnt known whether he also suffered self inflicted injuries
3900523 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3900524 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well

3900547 i think it should be noted that nothing mccain has said is as aggressive as the actions of russia it strikes me odd right now to complain of aggressive words in the defense of democracy rather than condemning aggressive actions against a democracy

3900637 congressmen should be able to decide for themselves where and how they interact with their constituents and the american people

3900640 if he comes here and does something like speak at brandenburg against the wishes of the head of germanys government he could be seen as somewhat arrogant as presumptuous that he disregarded her wishes and went ahead to do this anyway
3900641 undermine the message that obama can work with u s allies and offers mccain evidence of obamas diplomatic inexperience
3900642 it will be probably the biggest pure campaign event ever held outside the united states
3900643 the gates too sexy for obama too sexy for obama
3900644 she doesnt want to mingle inside american election politics i can respect her position because up to now only heads of state have spoken before the brandenburg gate and here is someone who has not even been selected the nominee yet
3900645 the brandenburg gate is too important to also misuse it for internal american affairs
3900646 the wall street journal report of our fundraising numbers is way off the mark it appears that after 18 months some in the press still havent realized that anyone who is talking about numbers doesnt know what our numbers are
3900647 although this institution was already in distress i am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process
3900648 was concerned indymacs financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and could face a failure if prescriptive measures are not taken quickly
3900649 indymacs troubles just like countrywides were caused by practices that began and persisted over the last several years not by anything that happened in the last few days
3900650 if ots had done its job as regulator and not let indymacs poor and loose lending practices continue we wouldnt be where we are today instead of pointing false fingers of blame ots should start doing its job to prevent future indymacs
3900651 if schumer continues to go public with letters raising questions about the condition of individual institutions he will cause havoc in the banking system
3900652 leaking his indymac letter to the press was reckless and grossly irresponsible i dont see how he can be trusted with confidential information in the future what this incredibly stupid conduct does is put at risk the willingness of regulators to share any information with the congressional oversight committees after this youd be crazy to share information with schumer
3900653 a left wing extremist with no experience horrible tried and proven failure ideas and terrible judgment in friends supporters and staff that ought to frighten moderates and conservatives alike when they contemplate giving him the car keys

3900662 hey the democrats cant even pick a candidate do you really want them running the country
3900663 when you read that statement from the enemys camp declaring the united states guilty of war crimes for their illegal occupation of viet nam and demanded they leave at once did you mean it
3900664 obama needs to put the pressure on this clown and watch him crack

3900667 eviscerated while 100 witnesses congress stand by because it doesnt concern them
3900668 by obamas position and could not understand how he could vote for this
3900669 its like all those stories where someone is assaulted on the street and a hundred witnesses do nothing in this case the fourth amendment is going to be eviscerated tomorrow and a hundred people are going to watch it happen because its just not their problem theres not an ounce of principle not an ounce of public interest in this legislation
3900670 look people look at the pretty jon bonet ramsey story just pay no attention to those senators in the capitol

3900674 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3900675 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3900676 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3900677 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3900678 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3900679 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

3900689 as long you see the individual and the community as independent there will never be harmony between them on one end you will have hostility one encroaching upon the other and the other end you have permissiveness or non involvement
3900690 man cares little about the needs of the other and is concerned with them only insofar as they affect his personal interests people become objects that either hinder or facilitate personal objectives and are treated in a purely instrumental fashion
3900691 agree to contractual restraints on the ways everyone may pursue their interests
3900692 this ideal of moral autonomy in turn forms the basis for the justice traditions stress on the dignity of the individual person
3900693 exploring maternal ambivalence comparing findings with two opposing paradigms of intent
3900694 we are in the process of constructing a new political field and this is just the beginning
3900695 the result of the election could even turn on the decisions of the electoral court if there were litigation arising out of the results in certain critical seats
3900696 the electoral commission wrote to candidates saying that signs like that were a campaign expense and the commission assessed the value of standard sign at 6 per sqm which was over 17 a day
3900697 including construction and removal that came to about 4 600 for a four month campaign that was almost a quarter of the campaign allowance for just one sign
3900698 alternatively with the campaign spending limit at 20 0000 i could have sent one postcard to about two thirds of the electorate
3900699 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3900700 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3900701 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit

3900705 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3900706 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3900707 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3900708 thats just to make it safe to go in and and proceed with the next portion of the work which is the demolition of the 105 and 109 n buildings
3900709 the n reactor facility is different than the single pass reactors those are they had a lot of what i call gingerbread or other structures that came off the reactor building this one will be easier to put a roof on because were going to have a very low slope roof and pretty much just a single flat
3900710 we want to have all of the hazardous materials removed out of the building before we start tearing the building down it just makes that process much more safe
3900711 line up changes have really caused the ups and downs
3900712 im the most driven person in the world and some people just dont have that if wed have had a solid line up with dedicated guys wed be much further along

3900717 that we have to have a waste repository and that yucca mountain is the place it can be made safe
3900718 we will have a more dangerous situation in my point of view
3900719 its basically a bike on steroids in a good way
3900720 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away

3900736 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3900737 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3900738 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3900739 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3900740 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3900741 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3900742 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3900743 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3900744 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3900745 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3900746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3900747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3900748 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3900749 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3900750 live video is something weve always wanted to do but havent had the resources to do correctly but now with google we hope to launch something this year
3900751 our source says that google goog has never really seriously considered a live video service were told that the notion was discussed months after chens statement but that the idea was tabled for a variety of reasons chief among them it would add significantly to googles infrastructure and bandwidth costs at a time when its trying to prove that the 1 65 billion it paid to buy the company will at some point pay off
3900752 trying to prove that the 1 65 billion it paid to buy the company will at some point pay off
3900753 it will go into our operating fund and interest gained on the investment will provide a steady stream of income we will still need to fundraise but it will be a good start
3900754 every year a large percentage of our operation budget comes from corporate sponsorship and donations this will help ease that burden

3900759 in essence what were going to do is bring everyone to the table and say weve identified you and were going to give you two paths to go down
3900760 we would prefer you to take this path where we have some resources in place for you to use and people who genuinely want to help you and change your lifestyle or youre going to go down this path where were going to target you and its going to be one where youll end up in jail and possibly in jail for a very long time
3900761 the truth of the matter is if you have a group of documented gang members hanging on a corner the police are going to stop and talk to them
3900762 you already have them on the list and youre waiting for them to trip and then you move on them
3900763 a lot of them we know their aunts uncles mothers fathers
3900764 it is an opportunity if its framed right i certainly dont want to be part of an effort that gives the parents nor these young men false expectations that we have a safety net there
3900765 as a neighborhood preacher i am tired of the only phone calls i get is when a young man has been killed or a young woman is shot and they need a preacher

3900812 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3900813 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3900814 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3900815 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3900816 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3900826 wenn mccain will beratung von jemandem dessen private interessen als einmal und k nftigen lobbyist kann sich auf die objektivit t der beratung das ist seine wahl zu treffen

3901057 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3901058 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3901059 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are getting closer to it
3901060 ik heb zelf ooit in leuven op kot gezeten en heb toen dagen rondgezworven om het ideale kot te vinden helaas zonder succes
3901061 ik kwam van onder moeders vleugels en heb toen geleerd dat compromissen sluiten op vlak van comfort een noodzaak was in het kotleven
3901062 de 10 finalisten hebben er veel voor over om het kot van hun dromen te winnen en gelijk hebben ze
3901063 ik moest mijn kot zelf betalen en heb daarvoor hard gezwoegd in een industri le wasserij om die centen bij elkaar te krijgen ik kan me dus h l goed voorstellen wat een vrijheid zon jim kot deluxe kan bieden ik zou er ook absoluut voor gaan

3901071 i can see game day being something that will be kind of difficult

3901076 this time of year is really nice in iowa texas is really hot we were down there early in the summer and you expect it to be hot in texas just like you expect iowa to be cold in january
3901077 had i known this was going to happen for them i never would have done this never and im sorry i just wanted to say im sorry
3901078 its brand new to me i mean i know the shot link takes the yardages and gives all of the information to the television broadcasters so that they can tell you whats going on exactly where they are i didnt really have any idea how it worked
3901079 its instantaneous from the time the walking scorer tells us what the score is weve sent it to the score boards to the tv compound weve sent it back to headquarters and then its been distributed to the internet
3901080 it gives not just the people at the course the ability to see whats going on
3901081 but it does give the world access to all this information and to know what their favorite player is doing or how the tournament is doing

3901094 i was a bit pessimistic about this dam forming and i was down last week actually and i was really quite startled
3901095 i think this is a much higher probability of making a dam this time than the last

3901104 officers boarded the bus and located the woman matching the description given she was asleep at the back of the bus at the time the suspect was removed from the bus a search of her was conducted and a 9 mm handgun was recovered hidden under her clothing
3901105 at no time while the police were dealing with the suspect were any passengers in any danger two other passengers travelling with the suspect were questioned and allowed to continue on their way

3901107 the city said that if the jacks did not sign the lease agreement according to their terms they wouldnt provide services to a 15 acre development property adjacent to the property in question
3901108 i am very pleased that these negotiations have resulted in an agreement that is beneficial to all the parties involved
3901109 i particularly want to thank the jack family and the okanagan indian band for their willingness to come to the table and continue talks with the city as i know that all parties were committed to reaching a positive agreement

3901120 i think it is a good idea if such an opportunity comes my way to go and play in pakistan
3901121 you dont have tournaments there otherwise i would have loves to come and play in pakistan
3901122 i remember that my first ever tournament outside india was in pakistan its great place and i will definitely go there in future when the opportunity comes

3901138 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
3901139 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3901140 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3901141 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3901142 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
3901143 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3901144 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3901145 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
3901146 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
3901147 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3901148 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rain forests their people and their species
3901149 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3901150 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3901151 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law

3901154 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3901155 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3901156 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3901157 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3901158 the problem with the huff and the democrat party is they produce only a stream of hypocrisy
3901159 the republican party is a party with bad ideas unfortunately the democratic party is a party with no ideas
3901160 wouldnt it be nice to hear that somebody just wanted to run the country responsibly and according to the will of the majority of its occupants
3901161 i dont think that as a country we have added to our appeal internationally by the iraq war thats pretty clear and i would say that a continuation of those policies is what has been somewhat and will continue to be the centerpiece of al qaeda keeping things going against america every statistic tells us that so yes common sense will tell you that mccains foreign policy is a danger though common sense seems to be void in a lot of these republicans
3901162 mitch mcconnell has been there 24 years and george bush has been there for eight and effectively what they are saying is that it wasnt important to deal with energy during the first 7 5 years but all of a sudden now it is important because it is election time
3901163 i think that mitch mcconnell is the quintessential example of a politician who will do anything or say anything to get elected and i dont think it is any more complicated than that
3901164 the reason he is not a democrat right now is not because he is philosophically like new york city mayor michael bloomberg to become an independent
3901165 he chose to become an independent because he got beat in the democratic primary in most states you wouldnt have the ability to do that he is not there by choice like someone like bloomberg he is there because it is the only way to get elected which is somewhat consistent with the guy i am running against who will say or do anything to get elected and so even though you might admire a lot of the things joe lieberman may stand for the process that got him there is nothing noble
3901166 anything that invades the freedom of americans whether it be privacy or anything else it should be handled with such kid gloves if there is any abuse of the system it clearly should be investigated you should have to be accountable for your actions
3901167 they have also had control as we know of the justice department and there have been plenty of stories that showed they havent handled that right so if you cant rely on leadership to be honest in what they do and how they do that is at the very core of the system but that is going to change they are not going to be the judge and jury of everything they do and what they have done beginning in january 2009
3901168 for the first time there has actually been a dialogue where both our leadership and iraq agrees that there is a timetable and here is what we want to do and we all ought to move toward it
3901169 and it was interesting that with all the opportunities that george bush has had to enter a dialogue and the opportunities that sen mccain has had to enter a dialogue it is interesting that it only occurred when barack obama went over there maybe it indicated that someone with some communicative skills who loves to reach compromises might be an important part of the next leadership of this country
3901170 anybody of the caliber of barack obama does nothing but add gravitas to our campaign and keep in mind the republicans dont have any policy to run on that has worked well for the average working man and woman for the country there are some people who think that the government could have taken a seven and a half year vacation and they would be better off today
3901171 si este escenario hubiera ocurrido hace nueve meses no hubiera sido capturado o hubiera pedido ayuda y lo hubieran dejado ir

3901174 she was despondent i dont know if she understood english
3901175 morphing our olympic athletes into unpaid billboards for the polo pony and rider
3901176 ralph lauren probably paid a ton of money for that license i mean people dont realize and im not saying that its right but the olympic license he had to pay for that so its no different than a big hp commercial or a big brought to you by visa in between the spots
3901177 he was trying to get credit probably for the fact that he designed it i dont know i dont think its that much of a controversy if they saw a swoosh would they have said anything if they saw adidas three stripes would they have said anything somehow its okay for a sports brand
3901178 if it was me thered have been a big ass rhino ecko logo on there if it was me i would have made sure people knew you know what i mean i think thats a part of the idea of the licensing agreement and then hes got the ability to go resell it i believe i bet you that stuff is even in the stores right now
3901179 i dont fashion love her i love love her she has an iconic look and she is a caricature in some ways and i dont mean that negatively
3901180 print that i laughed out loud shes more likely to press big dangly earrings or chunky necklaces on you no one can make somebody do something theyre not already predisposed to doing
3901181 if anything that woman makes me eat when i leave zoes place after a fitting i feel better about myself because she has only ever encouraged me to stay the way i am
3901182 i dont have one client right now who is a size 0 all of my clients have athletic or curvy healthy bodies
3901183 now my heroes are a reality in my life its not like i cant believe im having dinner with john galliano or karl lagerfeld but i still die like when i talk to tom ford when i was in my 20s and he was doing the whole gucci horse bit pants are you kidding me
3901184 and she said im battling cancer for the third time and i read your book every night look i still get chills because it makes me want to be beautiful again
3901185 sometimes my husband rodger will say honey she looks like you but in the case of cameron or jennifer garner or demi moore i would never say they were a zoebot you never see jennifer in a bohemian caftan wavy hair and sunglasses the size of her face you know
3901186 truth i dont im not a lady who lunches its a lull in the day
3901187 when im on downtime like on vacation with rodger i take care of myself but when its me working on my own its 7 00 p m and ive had coffee and a grapefruit
3901188 i immediately worked my body differently as soon as i had curves i was like i want to stick my butt out show my cleavage i immediately felt sexy i dont feel sexy on a daily basis in fact i never feel sexy
3901189 our awards are based on the degree of risk people place themselves in in such situations
3901190 ms aquinos actions that morning were deemed to be of greater risk than the actions of the others who went to help
3901191 she screamed at the gunman to stop and he certainly looked back at her and identified her and she continued to harangue him until he turned and left the scene
3901192 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3901193 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3901194 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3901195 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3901196 modern israeli weapons would definitely defeat the outdated russian army which lacks trained pilots and tank drivers in fact none of them conforms to the israeli or american standards for the lack of training
3901197 these three suspects were arrested due to some excellent patrol work
3901198 in most of the cases the vehicles are left unlocked making it easy for suspects to enter vehicles and steal valuables
3901199 its very important for residents to keep their cars locked at all times when theyre not in it
3901200 i feel like at montana ive gotten a really high quality education at a really affordable cost and thats something thats becoming rarer and rarer missoula is also only a couple hours drive away from some of the most beautiful places on earth thats appealing for not only students but faculty too we have great teachers who come to montana because they love the outdoors and because of that we have a world class faculty here
3901201 i think anyone who is thinking about college should take a look at us what youll find is a wonderful location a welcoming community and faculty members who love to interact with undergraduates and graduates alike we take a student focused kind of approach that provides the chance both to live in a beautiful place and do very well as a student
3901202 the best thing about ole miss is were almost like two schools in one theres the university of mississippi side the academic side where you get a top education and then theres the ole miss side the side that fosters a lot of social interaction through the greek system and student organizations it prepares you to compete academically but also relate to people from different backgrounds
3901203 the university of mississippi offers its students a superior education from a world class faculty who consistently demonstrate genuine interest and concern for their students with academic units like the barksdale honors college the croft institute for international studies and the lott leadership institute the university attracts the best and brightest students from across the country and prepares them to excel in the competitive global marketplace
3901204 unlike any other school in the um system kansas city has professional schools like pharmacy dental medical and the law school with those schools you get a broader perspective than youd get at a traditional university not to mention that its set in an urban area umkc is also fairly new to the system so you actually get a chance to be a part of history and to establish your own history at the same time its a great time for change in kansas city
3901205 students get a small college experience at a research university here liberal arts colleges have big advantages over research universities in that undergraduates tend to get lost at bigger schools were not a large university but we are a research university with a wide range of professional schools and all kinds of opportunities
3901206 i think the variety mizzou offers is unparalleled its a place with rich tradition but modern innovation a big campus but a close knit community an intellectually challenging environment but the best four years of your life
3901207 mu is a comprehensive campus and as such we offer a broad array of academic programs this allows students to explore different disciplines before choosing a major and also affords our students the ability to add minors that complement their major students also have opportunities through internships study abroad programs and student organizations all embedded in a campus culture that values teaching learning and student success

3901210 home packages help older australians continue to live in their own homes and remain independent and active
3901211 the australian government is significantly increasing the level of assistance provided to older australians and their families
3901212 the number of each packages grew by 28 per cent to 3 302 operational packages while the new each dementia packages doubled from 600 to nearly 1 300
3901213 the report also found some interesting trends in demographics with women making up the majority of care recipients 71 per cent for the cacp program
3901214 cacp recipients were also the oldest profile with 65 per cent 80 years and over compared with each recipients who were a younger demographic
3901215 by the end of 2006 07 the combined total for cacps each and each dementia packages was 21 8 packages per 1 000 australians 70 years and over which the government plans to increase to 25 per 1 000 by 2010 11
3901216 i think were definitely getting caught up in the notion that global growth is slowing
3901217 over the next couple of months we expect to see continued pressure from food and energy prices driving the headline rate towards a peak of nearly 6 per cent
3901218 clevelands plight is unique because of an unusually high rate of lead poisoning
3901219 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3901220 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3901221 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3901222 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3901223 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3901224 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3901225 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3901226 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3901227 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3901228 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3901229 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3901230 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3901231 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3901232 desde alg n lugar pretenden calificar riesgos y quieren venir a convencernos a los argentinos de que estamos en problemas
3901233 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3901234 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
3901235 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
3901236 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
3901237 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
3901238 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal
3901239 listen mister there is nothing clean about stumping a goat let me tell you the entire city of delhi knows this from keen personal experience about which they bally wont shut up and yet they still pursue goats with an avidity and a zest which boggles the mind staggers the senses and buggers the imagination and the goat the last bit that is bally perverts and crypto pakis tis a fine tradition in delhi

3901242 in this age of 4 a gallon gas and staycations we felt that vudu viewers deserved a break and should be able to watch great films for just 99
3901243 these initiatives are groundbreaking our 99 rental renewal is a first in our industry and will make it easier for our viewers to finish watching a great movie when it fits their schedule not ours
3901244 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act
3901245 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the federal courts intervention to secure this funding
3901246 lets get the budget done and everything will fall into place
3901247 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3901248 when hardworking taxpayers cant even get health care in california
3901249 no receiver has ever defined what constitutes a constitutional level of health care
3901250 theyre throwing a lot of money at a standard thats never been established
3901251 goes to the very heart of the receivers remedial program
3901252 there have never been more options for viewing the olympics

3901481 the younger generations the x gen the y gen millenials they dont have a stigma about it
3901482 they would have never done this stuff if they would have believed this would happen
3901483 it was probably the most deplorable disgusting thing ive ever seen
3901484 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3901485 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him
3901486 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3901487 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3901488 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3901489 ive heard he said something do to about losing a job he didnt threaten anyone
3901490 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded
3901491 bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3901492 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
3901493 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3901494 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3901495 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3901496 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3901497 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3901498 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3901499 no one expects the democratic party not to support roe v wade but here weve gone from dogmatic positions to practical solutions
3901500 the language in the platform is a real step forward
3901501 for those women who want to take the child to term it strongly supports that choice and provides necessary support
3901502 if you are a pro life conservative this vote is chilling
3901503 we cannot risk an obama presidency and we certainly cannot risk a democrat president and democrat congress working together to pass an anti life agenda
3901504 sen casey endorsed sen obama and campaigned for him in pennsylvania so it is not a surprise that sen obama will include his supporters in the convention
3901505 sen obama is fully pro choice and the partys platform reflects in the strongest terms his solid commitment to a womans right to choose
3901506 our focus is electing sen obama as the next president because his administration will advance pro choice policies that will protect womens freedom and privacy unlike john mccain who we know will continue the failed anti choice policies of george w bush
3901507 while sen caseys position on a womans right to choose is at odds with the democratic party platform the democratic partys strength is its diversity of voices
3901508 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose
3901509 any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3901510 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives
3901511 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3901512 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3901513 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3901514 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives
3901515 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3901516 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3901517 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3901518 colin powell will endorse senator obama and he may well give a speech to the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3901519 he was the person who advertised himself as dan quayles brain colin powell has no plans to attend either convention
3901520 when people understand the world of opportunity they can find through computers and the internet they are inspired to learn 21st century technology skills
3901521 many of the communities we visit are initially hesitant to embrace information technology but we remove this barrier by tailoring our programs to meet local economic health and educational needs and ensuring our approach aligns with the indigenous cultures in which we work
3901522 thanks to vasconcelos support and the increased access to technology in our community we are making education in our schools more effective and meaningful for our children
3901523 vasconcelos is transforming peoples lives by bringing information knowledge and hope to communities
3901524 its work is providing new opportunities for people young and old to improve the quality of their lives and ensure a better future for their families i hope vasconcelos example will encourage more organizations and governments to provide greater access to information and technology for those most in need
3901525 people who have good trusting social support networks may have lower stress levels which presumably can lessen the inflammatory response a heightened inflammatory response has been linked to chronic disease and autoimmune illnesses
3901526 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
3901527 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
3901528 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement
3901529 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
3901530 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
3901531 i can understand why people are very upset and why theyre very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices
3901532 it does bother me that much of that is directed at us our job is to provide energy to provide it in a means that is reliable and we hope we can provide it in a means thats convenient as well to the consumer
3901533 i dont think theres any question that if these prices 3 50 4 a gallon for gasoline and the follow through effects on the cost of electricity are causing a lot of problems for a lot of americans their budgets just are very difficult for them to accommodate this
3901534 what we can do is add new supply and to provide means for people to use the energy more efficiently which will help reduce demand
3901535 and thats what were spending a lot of our effort doing is working on both sides of the demand equation and the supply equation
3901536 things like providing lighter weight tires tires that retain their pressure more efficiently lighter weight plastics to go into vehicles to reduce vehicle weight
3901537 not realistic for the united states or almost any other country
3901538 im not sure that its even desirable for the united states to pursue that as a goal
3901539 our countrys economy is so interdependent with the rest of the world in so many areas of not just commodities but capital markets so im not sure why we would view energy any differently than the way we view the rest of our economy
3901540 i think the response to that is to have as many diverse supplies of energy as possible and that means both in terms of geographic diversity you want to expose yourself or certainly have access for the american people to as many different geographic sources of supply as possible so the disruption in one area does not leave you hostage to any one area
3901541 its going to be very challenging to achieve that goal in that period of time and again so much of the energy issue that the united states deals with and the world deals with people i think do not have an appreciation for the lead times that are required
3901542 we cant drill our way out of this problem just like we cant conserve our way out of this problem just like we cant alternative fuels our way out of this problem
3901543 there is no one solution to this theres an integrative set of solutions and you have to undertake them all so when the whole debate focuses around we have to choose this one solution or that people are missing the point
3901544 for people or policymakers to pick one as being the winner is really shortsighted
3901545 and that does get to the question of are we doing everything here at home that we could be doing and i think most people have come to the realization that for many many years the united states has not fully developed its own natural resources
3901546 should be developing again all the supply sources and all the options that we can develop in a way thats efficient and is going to provide energy at a cost that americans can afford
3901547 for exxonmobil to make a meaningful difference weve really got to find a way to change those technologies to provide those alternative forms of energy on a much larger scale and at a cost that people can afford
3901548 it doesnt do the consumer a lot of good to substitute an alternative fuel that costs 5 for gasoline that costs 4
3901549 we havent found an alternative to invest in that makes a lot of sense for us
3901550 where we need to be 20 30 50 years down the road is continue to be the most efficient producer and most environmentally responsible producer of oil and natural gas to develop the next generation which is not available today the next generation of replacement fuels for the future

3901574 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3901575 frankly speaking once again i was surprised by the skills of the speech writers who prepared the statement of the u s president
3901576 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3901577 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game
3901578 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3901579 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3901580 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3901581 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3901582 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3901583 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3901584 i can tell you with all responsibility that there are no and cannot be any russian tanks in gori
3901585 the world seems to talk about cease fires while the worst kind of atrocities are being committed in my country
3901586 let the world finally wake up and take action and provide real security for the region
3901587 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening we are part of europe and part of europe is being aggressed now

3901592 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighboring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people

3901594 marijuana use and its association with adherence to antiretroviral therapy among hiv infected persons with moderate to severe nausea
3901595 examining subgroups of patients among those with nausea marijuana users were more likely to show an association with adherence than nonusers while among those without nausea marijuana use was lower associated with adherence
3901596 it is the first real concrete indication that medical marijuana specifically helps hiv drug adherence
3901597 essentially people experiencing nausea were staying on their anti hiv cocktails more consistently which adds to the success of treatment
3901598 adherence to medications is a challenge to any chronically ill patient and is critically important to hiv infected individuals as sustained high levels of adherence are required for long term viral suppression
3901599 if people cant tolerate drugs they tend not to take them
3901600 and if they can tolerate the medications theyre usually going to try and take the pills the right way
3901601 many people dont find the same anti nausea capabilities with marinol the synthetic form of a compound found in marijuana thc but when they smoke pot they do well

3901623 i believe that our pre season schedule will help this group of young men grow and mature and develop the team chemistry that will be needed to compete for a wac championship in march

3901744 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from sen mccain and sen obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience

3901818 in 1969 a 14 year old beatle fanatic named jerry levitan armed with a reel to reel tape deck snuck into john lennons hotel room in toronto and convinced john to do an interview about peace 38 years later jerry has produced a film about it using the original interview recording as the soundtrack director josh raskin has woven a visual narrative which tenderly romances lennons every word in a cascading flood of multipronged animation raskin marries the terrifyingly genius pen work of james braithwaite with masterful digital illustration by alex kurina resulting in a spell binding vessel for lennons boundless wit and timeless message

3901822 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3901823 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3901824 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3901825 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3901826 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3901827 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3901828 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3901829 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3901830 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3901831 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3901832 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3901833 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3901834 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3901835 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3901854 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3901855 no country except the large commodity exporting nations can perhaps expect to emerge unscathed from such adverse worldwide conditions
3901856 inflation growth and other macro economic outcomes are all likely to be severely impacted
3901857 theres a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect the indian economy
3901858 be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3901859 the risk is that an abrupt slowing in asia could occur sometime in late 2008 to early 2009

3901907 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
3901908 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3901909 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3901910 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3901911 rat meat will make up nutrition deficiencies among villagers since rats are a major source of protein
3901912 if i were convinced that america is a safer place because i get hassled at the airport i might put up with it but i doubt it i expect my story is similar to hundreds of thousands of people who are on this list and find themselves inconvenienced
3901913 members of congress nuns war heroes and other suspicious characters with names like robert johnson and gary smith have become trapped in the kafkaesque clutches of this list with little hope of escape
3901914 putting a million names on a watch list is a guarantee that the list will do more harm than good by interfering with the travel of innocent people and wasting huge amounts of our limited security resources on bureaucratic wheel spinning

3901920 canada is going to import droves and droves of our doctors and nurses
3901921 canadas need for our doctors will be for the next 20 years
3901922 for the past 25 years canada was only hiring caregivers now canada is a new market for our doctors and nurses
3901923 we expect that under the new regulation regime contracts for medical professionals like those of others will be coursed through our office henceforth
3901924 it is too early to say what effect or impact the recently signed mous will have on the medical professionals in the philippines vis a vis the desire of many of them to work abroad canada in particular
3901925 in a small hospital wed expect one or two to leave for abroad in a year
3901926 i dont think there is anything that can be done to stop this outflow of doctors from the philippines
3901927 to be a doctor in the philippines will cost you a fortune and it will take you forever just to break even especially if you will do your practice in the provinces
3901928 they might stay if the government gave them high wages and benefits like doctors here in north america but i doubt that will ever happen
3901929 door mijn snor te laten staan laat ik zien dat ik me graag voor dit doel inzet ik ben de komende maand veel met trainingskampen en wedstrijden bezig waar de gehele judo wereld mijn snor kan zien trainers toeschouwers en mede sporters zullen zien waar ik naast het judo voor sta en wat ik belangrijk vind hopelijk inspireert dit anderen om hier ook over na te gaan denken en rond te gaan kijken hoe zij mensen met kanker kunnen helpen
3901930 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
3901931 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
3901932 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
3901933 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
3901934 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
3901935 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
3901936 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
3901937 if we can alter the brain why not control it one potential use involves making soldiers want to fight
3901938 its way too tempting im knocking this thing over were goin out the back tonight fancy boy pull up those floppy cardigan sleeves cause youre hangin with irish blood tonight hands will get dirty what you are about to witness is what my family likes to call a performance piece the rich folks here actually buy this crap short time gap no we dont belong to this club that was my dad who parked your car short time gap honey i could get into this art stuff if its all like this little beauty thats sitting in the eye of my irish hurricane nightmare damn it im hearing those voices the fun ones the ones of my ancestry and i will obey i must break this tantalus rouse it is our way your family is a patron to the arts and mine just enjoys breaking it promise to bail me out cause you got me into this mess you put this million dollar teeter totter in front of me see you at the third precinct oh yeah i remembered my compact i refuse to sit for another mug shot without proper lighting and my concealer i cried for a week after i saw my last mug shot on tv my parents were so proud but i thought i looked fat they still have my intake papers on the fridge anyway bid farewell to this thing because in two seconds it enters the art afterlife see ya later and remember to thank your grandparents for the invite oh and tip my dad this time
3901939 can you recall the time you had the most average slice of white bread toasted at breakfast tell us all about it
3901940 thanks so much but lets go look for the rest of whatever you just gave me by mowing our way through the fridge
3901941 where there other planets that were school type experiences like here on earth
3901942 everything in the physical is a school but theres different degrees like this school in relationship to other ones is like kindergarten but thats not so bad because theres pre school amp theres no school theres graduate school amp stuff like that but there are worlds where people are doing incredible things with the physical the physical is like a forum for giving birth to spirits its the only way for spirits learning like for example just think of it this way if you were a spirit amp you were all powerful amp your mind could make happen anything that it thought of how could you learn can you imagine the havoc you would create in the universe youre put in a relatively harmless safe playpen this world is so uncomplicated relatively compared to the greater reality amp yet we think its so incredibly complex but this is real simple compared to the greater reality
3901943 the universe is constantly being created new amp i dont mean just quantitatively but more importantly qualitatively in other words the reason why you exist amp why i exist is because nothing like it has ever been before the thing that god needs to grow amp nurture slowly is more things with their unique will with their own unique identities the way that god increases his beingness amp his creativity qualitatively is by increasing experience so what does he do he multiplies the creative spirits in new amp ever changing forms all over the whole universe thats what we are when we go into this reality of this existence which is what happens when we die although this is like reality it is like a little playpen reality amp im talking about the real reality amp we begin to see the real nature of time amp space amp our being in relationship to all other beings we can really really participate in that creation amp like on a lower eschelon type of job there is learning participation observation amp experience
3901944 place where heaven and earth join as one perhaps even the doorway between the two
3901945 became wicked and were cast under the earth and punished with chains
3901946 the same christians speak of two divine sons locked in combat with one another they fight like quails the two sons since their fathers are in their dotage and too tired to fight
3901947 two sons of god one the son of the creator and the other the son of marcions god and he portrays their single combats the fathers are like the battles between quails or the fathers becoming useless through age and falling into their dotage do not meddle at all with one another but leave their sons to fight it out
3901948 became man that thou mayest learn from man how man may become god
3901949 their souls came into existence at the same time with their bodies or seem to be anterior to them
3901950 the books which bear the name enoch do not at all circulate in the churches as divine
3901951 we have now then to refute that statement of his which ruins as follows
3901952 in asserting generally that no god or son of god ever descended among men he overturns not only the opinions entertained by the majority of mankind regarding the manifestation of deity but also what was formerly admitted by himself
3901953 no god or son of god has come down or will come down
3901954 and now it the time for you reader who peruse the works of celsus and give your assent to what has been advanced either to overturn the belief in a god who visits the human race and exercises a providence over each individual man or to grant this and prove the falsity of the assertions of celsus
3901955 neither has a god nor the son of a god come down nor is to come down to mankind
3901956 but since he says in the next place as if the jews or christians had answered regarding those who come down to visit the human race that were angels
3901957 they are sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
3901958 let us make man in our image after our likeness
3901959 first serious attack was made by methodius bishop of patara in lycia in the early years of the fourth century he wrote vigorously against origen amp his followers in regard to doctrines characteristic of the
3901960 others however including such great names as athanasius amp the cappadocian fathers basil amp the two gregories while admitting that his works were not wholly free from error yet regarded him as orthodox in the main amp defended him
3901961 i whoever says or thinks that human souls pre existed i e that they had previously been spirits and holy powers but that satiated with the vision of god they had turned to evil and in this way the divine love in them had died out and they had therefore become souls and had been condemned to punishment in bodies shall be anathema ii if anyone says or thinks that the soul of the lord pre existed and was united with god the word before the incarnation and conception of the virgin let him be anathema
3901962 is quite natural to conclude that god had revealed to the angels from the beginning the project of incarnation whose accomplishment was to take place in the course of the ages but precisely this interpretation of christs coming was unknown to tradition

3901974 they intervene indonesian government with the pretext of freedom of speech
3901975 we call for the moslem in papua to stand side by side with the moslem all over indonesia to reject the plan of the kuffar colonizer to separate the province from indonesia it is because this kind of separatist movement is a great sin before allah swt

3901983 i love r amp b and hip hop and some rap music
3901984 sometimes i might do some old 90s alternative i love the simpsons and ugly betty ugly betty makes me cry every single episode and there are not a lot of things that get to me like that show does it just seems so relevant to me being a different girl in a world full of people obsessed with fashion and money

3902042 i think overall it has been successful i am frustrated in the sense that we havent been able to implement more of the plans we had but all for the good of the conservative party the london mayoral elections and three by elections have given us the opportunity to show how effective we can be and how well the party is doing the press coverage has been good there is television interest and the emergence of new blogs relating to cf has shown that we are all doing a good job there is a significant amount still to do but i would like to thank the executive and the members for all the support they have shown cf is growing the membership is refreshing and we are evolving into an organisation that can make a significant impact on the national political scene i wouldnt particularly change anything ive done but i would prefer to have done more communicated more and visited more branches

3902073 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3902078 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3902079 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us

3902125 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3902126 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3902127 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised

3902169 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3902170 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3902171 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3902172 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3902173 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3902174 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3902175 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3902176 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001

3902179 i played very well last week and i dont think he played particularly well the courts there give higher bounces a little bit slower which benefited me a little bit i had a little more time on the forehand i come in here with not much practice time
3902180 having gone in 04 and medal ling especially in medal ling made my decision a little easier i thought it was nice to stay close to home and play a few tournaments that i enjoy playing here
3902181 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3902182 i never played well there it was my decision it could be my mistake or i was right or wrong i dont know but i made it
3902183 yeah it was just a mental error i just played sloppy im just gonna have to bear down mentally from here on up
3902184 i really enjoy it here one of my first good memories is here in 2000 i ended up in the quarter finals and i think i was 17 and got to play andre out there and beat a couple of good top twenty players that week which was huge for me at the time i dont even know if i was ranked in the top 300 as soon as you get back on a court youve had success on you feel good right away
3902185 it definitely wasnt an easy decision and i said i could easily look back and realize that it could be the wrong one it was purely from a tennis standpoint and what i thought would prepare me best for the us open of course i miss being there and of course when im watching the opening ceremonies im thinking about it i knew that making that decision there was almost going to be a certainty that parts of me was going to regret it and obviously thats happened a little bit
3902186 he mccain has always felt that sound science is a foundation of good public policy

3902188 two days ago i got out of the game and we got back to the olympic village and everybody was outside crying very upset and they were going home
3902189 he told us you have to go to the fields and play and respect the olympics
3902190 before the match we were talking to the georgia people
3902191 they were saying they wanted to be fully represented to show that the georgia people are warriors i felt the whole county cheering for us and we had to show that georgia people are fighters
3902192 yes i really felt like i was representing the people in georgia
3902193 i dont want to get political because this is the olympic games but down in my heart i wanted to beat russia for sure
3902194 they are not georgians they are brazilians and their coach is brazilian too
3902195 yes if they were georgian this match would be influence but in fact they are not
3902196 of course i know mikheil saakashvili and i was two days ago with his wife so i dont know what shes talking about
3902197 if they beat us today they would call us the georgians if they lose we are brazilians
3902198 it is better to make war to make a battle to make a fight on the sporting fields and not outside the sporting fields it is very important i send this message to everyone whos involved in these believe me crazy moments

3902201 the athletic department was looking for a tool it could use to better communicate with our admissions counselors on recruitment
3902202 there were some products in the marketplace specifically targeted for that but i was looking at beyond just that specific requirement and looking at crm as a need as a whole for the entire college this has both the entry level capability to get you started with athletics as well as tools to assist with admissions and advancement initiatives

3902205 a navigable corridor surely exists now as one can avoid the various ice floes
3902206 a navigable corridor and having the entire area depleted of sea ice
3902207 these regions started the melt season covered with thin first year ice which is especially vulnerable to melting out completely
3902208 thin ice is also vulnerable to breakup by winds the last 10 days have seen a windy stormy pattern that has accelerated the ice loss
3902209 i think the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflict breaking out
3902210 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3902211 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3902212 the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire
3902213 i dont think it means were going to reignite the cold war
3902214 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3902215 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president
3902216 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
3902217 whatever we think at the moment we can all reserve that for a future time
3902218 ive been talking to senator mccain several times a day
3902219 mccain has been fighting for freedom in georgia for many many years
3902220 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oilsands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
3902221 oilsands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3902222 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3902223 sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3902224 shell say they care about climate change but theyre exploiting oilsands in canada releasing three times more greenhouse gases than conventional oil production shell ran an ad calling this sustainable wwf challenged shells greenwash and won the advertising standards authority agreed shell cant hide the impact of their oilsand projects find out the truth
3902225 perilous trends in the oil sector where increased investment in unconventional fossil fuels such as canadian oilsands and u s oil shales may dangerously contribute to climate change and cause local ecological disaster

3902227 having proved its worth in the armm poll automation will now be replicated on a wider scale with a view to assuring our people that come 2010 the conduct of national elections will be immensely improved
3902228 the officials decided to delay their visit since it would have strained the security further
3902229 the process of finalising electoral rolls was on also electoral photo identity cards were being issued the entire thing has come to a standstill
3902230 it is too early to make a categorical statement after tomorrows meeting the election commission will also hold a meeting with the home ministry and representatives of paramilitary forces and the army to discuss the security scenario in the state
3902231 either the elections have to happen by november or they will have to take place with the lok sabha elections sometime in march next year in that case presidents rule will have to be extended in the state
3902232 show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
3902233 we are excited about it we are a little nervous too
3902234 i think if they take advantage of our safety nets and they want to study and be here i think theyll be fine

3902254 cwa compares the u s average using this speed test to advertised speeds of carriers in other countries which is not an apples to apples comparison actual user speeds in those countries may vary just as they do in the u s
3902255 we ask the end users if they are satisfied with their current speed and 85 percent are very satisfied michael paxton an in stat analyst told technewsworld
3902256 for the way they use the internet it is more than enough bandwidth unless youre a big downloader or peer to peer user you have enough bandwidth
3902257 they dont prevent them those applications exist maybe not down to the household but between hospitals and a doctors office or research facility the applications that i have seen or heard about most peoples broadband connections can handle them

3902304 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home

3902311 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses

3902330 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
3902331 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3902332 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3902333 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3902334 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3902335 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3902336 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3902337 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3902338 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3902339 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3902340 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3902341 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3902342 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda

3902370 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3902371 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3902372 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3902373 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me
3902374 i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3902375 would michael be in the top 25 if peter had come on board earlier in the year who knows
3902376 he was not all that positive initially and im sure he probably dropped me from his christmas card list but i think im back on it now it just took him a day to digest it
3902377 well put him back in the car at richmond and run him for the rest of the year thats the plan hes not fired
3902378 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now
3902379 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now
3902380 i dont know why but i didnt see myself playing for france
3902381 for the moment ive done nothing but it has fallen on me so all is good
3902382 i am very happy but im trying not to get too excited i am going to go and see what happens
3902383 my brother has been telling me all the time to look at the list but i never did
3902384 i was told about it in a text from a friend i was very surprised
3902385 straight away when i read the text i told myself this was rubbish as usual he has a habit of sending me stupid things like that
3902386 but then people told me to look on the internet and there it was
3902387 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now
3902388 yes a very little spark will be capable of giving birth to great lights in the church like the doctors and martyrs in heaven we shall not meet with indifferent glances because all the elect will discover that they owe to each other the graces that merited the crown for them
3902389 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now
3902390 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
3902391 brendas last published study using this data set was released in 2000 after she moved to her present facility in 1995
3902392 immediately after that publication one of my colleagues requested a break down of details which had only been superficially summarized in one her tables one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
3902393 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
3902394 this is very troubling on two counts first the apas own ethics rule 8 14 requires research psychologists to share their data for verification of findings secondly she is the chair of the apa abortion task force which is at least in theory supposed to bring full and clear light to this issue but how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
3902395 there is no doubt that she has selectively reported her findings
3902396 we have seen in the unpublished tables details about specific negative reactions which were obscured in her published report by combining them with three to eight other reactions to create watered down composite scores
3902397 in my view it is irresponsible not to report the significant findings associated with individual symptoms for example she found that a number of women reported that they tried to cope with negative feelings about their abortions by drinking more or taking drugs but she has never not fully shared the details on these reactions in any of her published studies and by refusing to share her data for reanalysis by others she has prevented anyone else from reporting these findings either
3902398 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
3902399 even the modifier that there is no credible evidence of mental health risks in the ideal case of a low risk abortion patient is an admission that there is indeed some evidence that a single abortion can pose a risk to the mental health of a emotionally stable adult woman
3902400 in fact the report itself identifies a whole host of studies providing such evidence but it mutes a clear presentation of the findings of these studies by focusing on the limitations of each studys methodology which all studies have in order to justify ignoring their clear implications
3902401 by failing to call on therapists to be alert and sensitive to the negative emotional experiences women attribute to their abortions the task force has allowed ideology to trump sensitivity
3902402 instead they are ignoring the reality of how and why abortions take place and are instead focused on drawing conclusions regarding the safety of abortion for an emotionally stable pro choice adult woman who is freely choosing a wanted abortion without any moral qualms but that doesnt reflect the reality of most abortion situations
3902403 the fact is that coerced abortions are more common than wanted abortions studies show that over 60 of american women are having abortions often against their moral beliefs because they feel pressured into it by third parties these women need therapist and family members to be open to and responsive to their pain not dismissive of it as an anomaly sadly this is an ideological report that simply ignores the concerns and needs of those women for whom abortion has been a heartache rather than a triumph
3902404 i cut 33 off what i initially wanted because i want to coach again especially a big team like cerro sporting matters are more important than finances
3902405 i have a long career ahead of me and i dont need a big contract i only have to clarify whether theyre sending me the plane tickets or if im paying myself
3902406 for anyone who feels patriotic to pull on the azzurri shirt is the top
3902407 for me its a great emotion i have waited for this day for a long time its an important moment for me and my family i am proud to be italian
3902408 it was more emotional than my serie a debut now the best present would be to get into the national team the senior one but even the under 21 side would be very good
3902409 im italian from birth but its only become fact today
3902410 there was a moment in which i considered accepting the offer and saying yes to the ghana side but then the idea of playing for the country where i have been since birth prevailed frank juric chat
3902411 they can be a surprise team who nobody reckons with and i have faith in them finishing in the top five
3902412 they had a team which was not quite first class in many positions so i can understand them transfers
3902413 i dont think there will be the same domination from bayern like last year
3902414 they will probably have enough to win the title in the end but i am sure we are in for a pulsating season
3902415 we are realistic and know that our rivals are all stronger compared to last year
3902416 five or six years ago there were five or six teams who fought for the top six positions but now there are 10 to 12
3902417 why the right gets it wrong and the left doesnt get it
3902418 if a catholic in his or her personal or professional life were knowingly and obstinately to reject the defined doctrines of the church or knowingly and obstinately to repudiate her definitive teaching on moral issues however he or she would seriously diminish his or her communion with the church reception of holy communion in such a situation would not accord with the nature of the eucharistic celebration so that he or she should refrain
3902419 a well formed christian conscience does not permit one to vote for a political program or an individual law that contradicts the fundamental contents of faith and morals
3902420 the reasoning is a bit flawed based on some vital data you may not have considered yet
3902421 i see hopeful signs in both parties and with both presidential candidates
3902422 he has proved himself worthy during training we think he is guy who can mean a lot to nac in the future
3902423 relative differences the myth of 1 june 29 2007 but even these figures are only measuring about 2 of our total genetic makeup that is those genes that code for proteins the building blocks of our physical bodies and functions
3902424 i dont think there is any way to calculate a number percentage of similarity in the end its a political and social and cultural thing about how we see our differences

3902435 we think he is going to be a great addition
3902436 he holds a superior football coaching certificate from the university of belgrade

3902443 isp is truly excited to establish this new relationship with the university of arkansas one of the great athletic programs in the country
3902444 we also are excited about being able to work with katv and building on the 40 year tradition katv has established in bringing the passion of razorback athletics to the state of arkansas
3902445 we are pleased that through our new agreement with isp katv will remain at the forefront of razorback coverage for many years to come
3902446 we have enjoyed our four decade partnership with the university of arkansas and are looking forward to maintaining that relationship moving forward via our partnership with isp as the continuing home of the razorbacks
3902447 the uniqueness of the razorback brand and the strength of our university and athletic programs provides us a tremendous opportunity to increase our brand locally regionally and nationally the increased exposure and enhanced opportunities for national sponsorships will compliment our outstanding statewide exposure provided by our long time partner katv
3902448 our agreement with isp not only helps protect us from uncertain financial times but also guarantees revenue at a significantly higher level than what we have generated in the past

3902481 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3902482 playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3902483 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3902484 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3902485 in the shopping mall of the mind hes in the toy department
3902486 we were going really fast we were going 100 miles and hour
3902487 for the first time in a long time we want to grab sony and kiss them square on the lips
3902488 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
3902489 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
3902490 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3902491 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons
3902492 he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3902493 for his clients and others where he educates them on how to get themselves and their companies up and running to maximize social media how cool is that for someone who does not know where to start
3902494 he was promised a severance and he should get his severance
3902495 its a slap in the face to the supporters of the university
3902496 it sends the message that its more about money than winning souls
3902497 you tell the critics mr roberts has done nothing wrong
3902498 he has not misspent and lived lavishly off oru money
3902499 i think its a fair sentence i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
3902500 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
3902501 i am a college graduate and have no delusions what will occur as an end result of these proceedings
3902502 its hard to sit back and see where they stopped it and not know if they would start if again i did everything i could and it was stopped at some point you just sit back and laugh
3902503 hes able to at least make one decision on his own
3902504 i cant explain it my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid but i was a willing participant i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
3902505 in tune with public opinion and hes aware that public opinion doesnt support killing someone who has such a diminished role as an accomplice
3902506 he should be given life without parole in a maximum security unit and perhaps he could serve his time with the man who pulled the trigger
3902507 the juxtaposition of one man who did not kill being executed and another man who did kill being pardoned just stuck in peoples craw
3902508 what do you think is going to happen when a guy goes into a convenience store to rob it and hes armed with a gun and your job is to help him commit that crime
3902509 they told me they were going to kill me unless i stopped preaching my mystic gospel
3902510 god is the greatest and i didnt come to die on death row
3902511 theyre trying to silence me because i know about the satanic secret societies of the tdc shadow government e system
3902512 if you dont meet the standard then you cannot be legally executed
3902513 i dont think he could ever come all the way back
3902514 i really dont but he would able to feel more comfortable and get more rehabilitation
3902515 it makes no sense for the state to keep someone on death row under severe conditions when hes been recognized as severely ill
3902516 what the factor is is that riles was competent when he was tried and given a legal sentence his confinement is still legal and he simply has a condition right now that makes him not eligible for execution but that could change
3902517 im not just going to let him sit there and not fight for him
3902518 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked as to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
3902519 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
3902520 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3902521 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3902522 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3902523 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3902524 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3902525 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3902526 sow an act and you reap a habit sow a habit and you reap a character sow a character and you reap a destiny
3902527 a sign on the wall reads warning electric stun devices used in this facility

3902529 boston power has developed a game changing lithium ion battery system thats poised to address that the company is creating tremendous excitement throughout the industry
3902530 all around us we are seeing young people today become interested again in the old hymns they are looking for something solid substantial lasting substantive and theyre finding them in the great texts that the church has been singing for two thousand years sadly however in our time all around us they have been so forgotten that weve forgotten the stories of their authors the composers and we havent even paid attention to their texts
3902531 my grandmother saved it my mother threw it away and now im buying it back why we still need hymns in a postmodern world
3902532 hymns as passion story and coummunity exploring connections with a postmodern world
3902533 can we believe the bible has the bible been accurately transmitted from generation to generation across millennia

3902541 today at the renewable energy center lab at the unr tmcc redfield campus jill derby rolled out her plan to end the nations energy crisis
3902542 my energy plan calls for activating all our resources to end our dependence on foreign oil through new drilling and the investment of all new drilling revenues into renewable energy development this means greater national security cleaner environment and new jobs for nevada
3902543 i am proud to be associated with a plan that grows america s economy right here in nevada and provides sustainable solutions that protect our pocketbooks and security while reducing our environmental impacts
3902544 it isnt exact thats one we talked about it has to be exact
3902545 to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth
3902546 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
3902547 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
3902548 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
3902549 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
3902550 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
3902551 we really need to get out of a jam here

3902561 the script combines deeply researched accurate details such as katherine mending henrys shirts cardinal campeggios gout and mores refusal in the opening scene to accept a letter from the emperor charles v with glaring historical hogwash
3902562 for those of you unfamiliar john guy is one of the preminent historians specializing in tudor history this is what he had to say about episode 2 1 and the rest of the series
3902563 the script combines deeply researched accurate details such as katherine mending henrys shirts cardinal campeggios gout and mores refusal in the opening scene to accept a letter from the emperor charles v with glaring historical hogwash
3902564 we were all novices once ive learned things from this board and the exchange of opinions and ideas that have spurred further research
3902565 what is most annoying is that people who are getting interested in the tudors because of the showtime series are being mislead if they take the series as factual ive seen evidence of that on quite a few threads

3902569 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
3902570 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror

3902575 im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
3902576 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
3902577 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination
3902578 arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defense

3902581 as long you see the individual and the community as independent there will never be harmony between them on one end you will have hostility one encroaching upon the other and the other end you have permissiveness or non involvement
3902582 man cares little about the needs of the other and is concerned with them only insofar as they affect his personal interests people become objects that either hinder or facilitate personal objectives and are treated in a purely instrumental fashion
3902583 agree to contractual restraints on the ways everyone may pursue their interests

3902587 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3902588 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse places on earth
3902589 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3902590 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3902591 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3902592 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3902593 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3902594 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
3902595 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror

3902687 if falsehood or lie has been perpetrated for twenty years it will only take a day for the truth to overcome it
3902688 so god has given both his promise and his oath these two things are unchangeable because
3902689 a lie is anything that is contrary to the word and counsel of the almighty god who is
3902690 indeed god tells the truth even if everyone else is a liar the scriptures say
3902691 for we can do nothing against the truth not serve any party or personal interest but
3902692 if falsehood or lie has been perpetrated for twenty years it will only take a day for the truth to overcome it

3902933 sex looks like it has become the unofficial sport of the beijing 2008 olympics after 100 000 condoms were handed out to athletes the condoms are being given away in the olympic village along with sex education leaflets and videos in a host of different languages there are 10 500 athletes so they could have nine condoms each if having sex with other competitors this would mean they are able to have it away 18 times during the competition lets hope they still get time to compete

3902957 obama maintaining a substantial 43 to 34 lead among those who are likely to vote in november with 5 selecting minor party candidates that lead is a decline for sen obama s since early june when he led his republican rival 50 to 35 among likely voters in the past two months more voters have gravitated to third party candidates 5 and a higher proportion is now undecided up from 15 to 21
3902958 but they will make a brief joint appearance their first of the campaign and warren will interview each separately about the constitution poverty aids human rights and other subjects many evangelicals believe that warrens growing profile and his willingness to welcome obama to his pulpit are evidence that he has emerged as the most pivotal figure in u s evangelicalism the forum with mccain and obama he said is his latest attempt to introduce civility into public discourse even if it irks some of his fellow evangelicals warren faced biting criticism in 2006 when obama spoke at his church for a global aids summit last year sen hillary rodham clinton d n y appeared at another aids conference at the church warren has been called perhaps americas most influential pastor an evangelical megastar who leads the nations fourth largest church reaches thousands of ministers through the internet and crusades against poverty and aids that globe trotting work and his phenomenally successful book the purpose driven life have propelled him into the vanguard of a movement that inspires young and socially conscious christians

3902963 after an interview should any of the applicants appear to be qualified for the position please contact a fragomen attorney immediately to further discuss the candidates background as it relates to the requirements stated for said position
3902964 critical legal advice they need to navigate and comply with this complex regulatory process
3902965 the government offices are so bureaucratic and theres so much red tape
3902966 and so in the last six years weve lived in doha dubai and bahrain before we moved here
3902967 and its not just the expense but the fact that you pay so much and youre still not getting the quality that youre used to or that you should get and that you expect to get for the price youre paying
3902968 but the apartment and the service provided were nice so it was a good experience all in all the building had a lovely cr che and even our neighbors were very nice people
3902969 average rental for a flat in mumbai in this part of south mumbai at least is about 7 000 to 9 000 dollars
3902970 and look what you get for it in dubai we were staying in a 3 500 square foot villa for much less than what were paying here and the villa was excellently maintained with manicured lawns and the complex even housed a pool
3902971 its at least half an hour to drive from there to any good school
3902972 i didnt really have a problem finding a school for my daughter
3902973 i have some relatives here who found out about good schools and spoke to the administration about a place for my daughter well before we got here
3902974 there is a lot more academic pressure on a child in an indian school as compared to an international school
3902975 malls here arent equipped with play areas for kids like they are in the middle east and in fact recreation for children is very limited all you can do is take them for a movie or to eat at restaurants
3902976 its very important especially since most of the buildings dont have any space for the children to cycle or run around in
3902977 i lived in the middle east and you can hire staff there at fairly decent rates as well so thats never really been a big treat for me
3902978 in fact one of the things that i find most frustrating here aside from the traffic is the fact that no one values your time
3902979 if a handyman tells you to expect him at one o clock in the afternoon to fix an air conditioner or to put up a curtain in mumbai that means that the person will show up hopefully at some point within a 24 hour period
3902980 you would be lucky if the repair man comes over by six in the evening
3902981 i have to tell you it was quite hard for me at first
3902982 therere a lot of issues to be considered when one buys an apartment here like for one thing the society should be a good one
3902983 its strange that the prices of apartments are just like new york over here yet nothing about the buildings are
3902984 theres a huge waiting list for all the good schools
3902985 its not like you can just register and then wait for the school to get back to you
3902986 you have to keep calling them back over and over to enquire whether your child has or has not been accepted
3902987 but everyone at the schools are so nice and im so happy with the nursery my children go to now
3902988 well since i have two kids i got to know the school mums and became a part of a great group called hopping bunnies and then gradually i started making friends with my childrens friends mothers
3902989 when i was in new york id just take the kids to the met or to the natural history museum or even just to central park but i cant do that here theres just nowhere that you can really take the kids for an outing
3902990 they just couldnt diagnose it correctly and instead kept prescribing antibiotics for my son
3902991 i have never used that stuff before and im just not comfortable with it
3902992 well sometimes people stare when i go jogging with my stroller in tow but i think that thats just because it is not something they usually see
3902993 you tend to get used to it and then you just learn to ignore things like that
3902994 you cant keep comparing mumbai to wherever you have come from because in many ways its really great but in many others it will disappoint so if you want to make this your home you have to learn to turn a blind eye to certain issues that may have otherwise bothered you my husband nakul and i love our whole mumbai experience its turning out to be quite an adventure for us
3902995 i felt trapped some days and frustrated that i could not go outside easily or pleasantly many many many people everywhere all the time limited footpaths chaotic and dangerous driving people living on the streets and yes people stare
3902996 expat groups in mumbai are incredibly warm welcoming and are wonderful resources after attending a few of their meetings you meet people who you choose to see outside of these groups
3902997 there really isnt much to do in mumbai on the weekends
3902998 slums everywhere homeless children roaming the streets and beggars this can be very painful
3902999 grocery shopping was very time consuming and not user friendly at all
3903000 due to hindu and muslim religions food shopping can take a while if you are looking to stock your freezer with standard western fare
3903001 pork beef and dairy products are all sold in separate shops from canned goods and fruits and vegetables
3903002 and usually with an hour long ride in traffic from one shop to the other i hadnt seen that coming at all
3903003 i felt trapped some days and frustrated that i could not go outside easily or pleasantly many many many people everywhere all the time limited footpaths chaotic and dangerous driving people living on the streets and yes people stare
3903004 prepare yourself that this is going to be completely different and not one aspect of life in mumbai will be the same as wherever you are moving from
3903005 get in touch with expatriate groups there before you arrive and ask as many questions as you need to
3903006 carry antiseptic wipes with you and have your health insurance and medical evacuation coverage up to date
3903007 be prepared to stand in queues to get the necessary paperwork done
3903008 business is booming in mumbai opportunities are endless and there seems to be a tremendous appetite for growth and success
3903009 it is great to see so many different types of people dialects religions and socio economic groups living in harmony in this massive city
3903010 you could eat for years and never have the same dish twice
3903011 in that anyone moving to mumbai from overseas is usually at a loss to understand how such expensive properties can come with no additional facilities attached to them basic rental in mumbai whether it is in south mumbai or bandra ranges between 8 000 to 10 000 a month for the kind of flat most people with families require 3 bhk and the quality of construction here is never on par with what the expatriate nri or foreign national would get for that kind of money overseas and yet those are the prevailing rates
3903012 its very hard for children who have studied abroad to get into an indian education system and even the parents would not be able to adjust
3903013 the very last choice for an expatriate nri or foreign national would be the ambani school in bandra they usually prefer sending their kids to the american school ecole mondiale podar international or either the french or german schools in south mumbai
3903014 most foreign nationals expatriates and nris are very well organized and would have made their inquiries regarding their childrens schooling several months before the actual move so many of them have already decided which school their children would go to well before they get here and all the admission formalities are often already sorted out
3903015 also there are differences in the capacity and usage of the facilities they are provided in their flats and what they have been previously accustomed to for instance water heaters are not meant for 24 hour usage here and they often break down as do air conditioners if they are over used
3903016 whether its a water heater that needs repair or a crack in the wall that needs patching up it is very hard for people moving here from overseas to understand why these things take so long to fix
3903017 but it cannot be helped because sometimes the local repair man will not come adequately prepared with the right tools for the task or will just not show up when he was meant to
3903018 claiming insurance for damaged goods can be a tricky affair
3903019 one should make sure that his or her belongings are insured at the port of destination so if the goods are damaged or lost in transit theres no ambiguity as far as insurance companies are concerned which would otherwise hinder the recovery of damages
3903020 nowadays most expatriates look for homes in the suburban areas rather than in south mumbai since banks and consulates have either already shifted to those areas or are in the process of shifting there
3903021 and many developers are now equipping their buildings with modern and world class facilities
3903022 make your applications to schools and begin the communication process with them as soon as you think about moving to mumbai
3903023 if you really want to see india at its best you have to find it in the bhangi cottage in a humble bhangi home
3903024 what i want you to understand if you can that the message of the east the message of asia is not to be learned through european spectacles through western spectacles not by imitating the tension of the west the gunpowder of the west the atom bomb of the west if you want to give a message again to the west it must be a message of love it must be a message of truth
3903025 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3903026 here is the first passionate love letter i have ever written in my life strange that my first passionate love letter should have been addressed to a dead girl can they feel i wonder those white silent people we call the dead
3903027 we m 1 were not in any way against working with the ufc weve spoken to them before about the possibility of working together anythings possible
3903028 even if fedor wins there is no major promotion that can take advantage of it in a meaningful way affliction will have serious money issues going forward and even if they run moderately successful shows every few months one day that is no threat to the ufc pro elite cannot offer anywhere near what zuffa can and who knows that their future is at this point by doing the fight the ufc would make millions in revenue on pay per view they would deny any other promotion the chance to put the biggest fight ever on and they could even get lucky and kill fedors myth if randy beats him
3903029 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
3903030 what am i trying to see if there aint nothing in sight why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight
3903031 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3903032 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3903033 did you leave the paper bag thats meant to be on your head at home
3903034 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3903035 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3903036 what am i trying to see if there aint nothing in sight why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight
3903037 what am i trying to see if there aint nothing in sight why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight

3903045 we ve sold some special cars during our 37 year history but this mg ranks among the most significant vehicles to ever cross the barrett jackson auction block
3903046 in 2007 we sold the ultra rare 427 shelby cobra super snake followed by carroll s personal 69 gt500 convertible this year in scottsdale now we re offering collectors a chance to nab the race car that started it all for the legend over half a century ago while also benefitting one of his charities carroll is an american icon both behind the wheel and under the hood an inspiration to enthusiasts of all ages
3903047 my good friend in dallas ed wilkins owned the car and let me drive it in the race
3903048 because it was early in my career i still had a lot to learn but knew how to go fast this mg changed my life because from that point forward i knew that i wanted to be involved with racing and sport cars
3903049 in addition to the amazing story this mg is in pristine condition and it s track ready
3903050 it would be quite a thrill to drive this beautiful sports car in a vintage race knowing that carroll crossed his first finish line behind the same wheel it s truly a collector s dream and will serve as the cornerstone of our inaugural las vegas event
3903051 there are two major pressures impacting the development of physician scientists
3903052 decreased funding by the national institutes of health has created enormous pressure on young researchers and the marketplace of current medicine with its increased demands to be clinically productive further constrains the time they can devote to research
3903053 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research
3903054 i m pleased that great research has the opportunity for funding
3903055 the continued market volatility resulted in another difficult quarter despite the disappointing results we look forward to the future with a high level of optimism

3903063 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3903064 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3903065 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3903066 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3903067 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3903068 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today

3903074 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3903075 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3903076 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3903077 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3903078 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3903079 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3903080 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3903081 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3903082 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3903083 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3903084 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3903085 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3903096 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa

3903109 al qaida is identifying training and positioning operatives for attacks in the west including in the us these operatives include north american and european citizens and legal residents with passports that allow them to travel to the united states without an american visa
3903110 ability to establish and manage links to other affiliated terrorist groups and facilitation networks is a key indicator of its organisational health these links help bolster its operational and propaganda reach
3903111 since early 2006 pakistani militant groups have increased their collaboration with al qaida this includes ethnic pashtun groups native to the tribal areas and groups from eastern pakistan most of whom previously focused on attacking kashmir in india
3903112 while a major focus of these groups is conducting attacks against coalition forces in afghanistan they provide safe haven to al qaida fighters collaborate on attacks inside pakistan and support external operations including against the west

3903133 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
3903134 lieberman and graham of course are key campaign allies of mccain
3903135 the idea is to showcase himself as a man of action during a time of international crisis and to remind people that the world is a dangerous place thats still filled with aggressive actors something that the mccain camp presumably thinks will play in his favor
3903136 mccains announcement of his key campaign allies trip abroad also seems designed to shoulder bush aside as the primary gop leadership figure here
3903137 but there appears to be more evidence of scheunemann using mccain for financial gain
3903138 the associated press reports that scheunemann and his partner michael mitchell

3903160 mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us

3903242 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
3903243 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3903244 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3903245 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3903246 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3903247 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3903248 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3903249 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3903250 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
3903251 social democracy is still here in all its variants defining our entire respectable political spectrum from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right we are now trapped in america inside a menshevik fantasy with the narrow bounds of respectable debate set for us by various brands of marxists it is now our task the task of the resurgent right of the paleo movement to break those bonds to finish the job to finish off marxism forever

3903259 the unusual combination of tremendous financial and academic resources a motivated yet supportive student body and an encouraging and engaging faculty creates an atmosphere in which students feel comfortable expressing and challenging ideas and are capable of achieving their aspirations this extremely positive academic environment is not at all what one would expect from a competitive ivy league institution

3903278 we are very well aware of the current situation regarding fansubbing and the industry
3903279 and we have complete respect for all the companies who are involved with our convention that is why we have made it a policy to not screen any material without the expressed permission of that shows rights holder
3903280 if we do not receive the permission we will not show it no exceptions there are several shows that we have put in our program schedule that we unfortunately were unable to receive permission for therefore we are not going to screen them and will be showing another series instead

3903285 there is complete agreement between the club and the player david jimenez silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons

3903291 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3903292 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3903293 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3903294 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3903295 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
3903296 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3903297 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement

3903309 i dont know if were very good but i think well find a lot out in the first half this week
3903310 this is a big physical team that can rush the passer can stop the run and can run the heck out of the ball its the perfect team for us to be playing in my opinion
3903311 the next two games will be a big test for him to see where hes at all the stuff out here hes taken care of now lets see if he can carry it over into the game
3903312 were just going to try to get down to the bottom of it i still cant touch anything i cant put my hand down still very painful my main thing is even if its broken it doesnt mean anything if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts
3903313 its very evident you can see that so its definitely something that weve got to push through right now if we had more depth wed be able to take a little more time off and let stuff heal but its training camp we dont have many other bodies so weve kind of got to play through everything right now
3903314 we would have preferred to wait but when you have this mysterious group playing ads that we think are misleading and incorrect and not giving a counter position i felt like we needed to come out
3903315 the ad continues pat mccrorys untruthful claims about bev perdue

3903320 last year he could not do the pre season preparation so he suffered a lot instead this year im not saying hes 100 percent ready because no one is but hes in good shape
3903321 i still dont know we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
3903322 the 0 1 percent month on month decline in retail sales in july confirms that the boost from the recent round of tax rebates has already faded

3903403 a diagnosis of death by neurological criteria is theory not scientific fact
3903404 some physicians question whether we can be sure the entire brain is really dead in patients declared dead in the u s by whole brain or in the u k by brain stem criteria
3903405 there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for brain death they are the subject of intense international debate various sets of neurological criteria for the diagnosis of brain death are used a person could be diagnosed as brain dead if one set is used and not be diagnosed as brain dead if another is used
3903406 doctors are very pragmatic but there is something inherently bothersome about changing the way we are going to determine death so that we can increase the numbers of organs for donation
3903407 dcd cardiac definition of death may represent an additional source of organs however dcd is a major change in end of life practice and poses significant ethical problems for end of life decision making

3903414 its bound to be the case that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth

3903473 despite the signing of the 1972 joint communiqu of the government of japan and the government of the peoples republic of china which normalized relations between the two countries for china the chinese peoples war of resistance against japanese aggression as the china japan war of 1937 to 1945 is called in china has never truly come to an emotional closure
3903474 the massacre of the jews by the german nazis during wwii was a trampling upon the human justice and the issue about sex slaves is an identical one and has no reason whatsoever to make it fade or weaken
3903475 giving a speech in september 2005 to mark the 60th anniversary of japans surrender at the end of world war two chinese president hu jintao said that after the end of the war many japanese from all walks of life faced squarely the historical fact that japanese militarists had launched the war of aggression against foreign countries and strongly denounced the atrocities japanese aggressors had committed in china their conscience and courage are highly commendable but the words do not stop there hu goes on to say that there are forces in japan that have categorically denied the aggressive nature of the war japan launched against china and the crimes it committed and have tried their best to whitewash its militarist aggression and call back the spirit of those class a war criminals who have been condemned by history it is true that there are those in japan who downplay or even extol its wartime past yet these are a minority voice and a regrettable but unavoidable side effect of living in a democratic nation when citizens are allowed to voice their opinions freely some of those opinions will be objectionable but short of direct hate speech such freedoms must be honored this is something china in its war of apology and without democracy simply cannot understand the past if not forgotten can serve as a guide for the future said hu by emphasizing the need to always remember the past we do not mean to continue the hatred instead we want to draw lessons from history and be forward looking only by remembering the past and drawing lessons from it can one avoid the repetition of historical tragedies but in what must rank as one of the most breathtakingly false mendacious and hypocritical statements ever issued by any world leader hu said history has eloquently proved that only when it adheres to the leadership of the cpc and the socialist road with chinese characteristics can the chinese nation create a brighter future exhaustive and meticulous research by professor r j rummel professor emeritus of political science university of hawaii suggests that between its founding in 1949 and 1987 the government of the peoples republic of china was responsible for the death of more than 75 million of its own citizens 75 million this is the leadership that says hu history eloquently proves leads to a brighter future the failings of the cpc are not open to inspection like the failings of other governments in other powerful nations to replace this inspection process china showers blame on what it views at excesses from outside its borders hatred should be based on facts not half truths rumors and misinterpretations of historical conflict now only teachable by history books written by the citizens of each country each book containing prejudices the other country will never accept teaching children how they should act in future may be more valid than teaching them how they should be guided by historical mythology
3903476 i was inspired by the reaction from both my clients and the viewers to the transformations i made on regular people i decided to create a line of products that makes it easy for people to achieve the flawless looks i was creating on television from home and that is what me by me zhgan is all about while working in the industry and on live televisions shows i recognized the need for multifunctional products that are versatile and easy to use i didnt have time to pull out 5 products i needed a quick fix
3903477 my goal was to develop products that allow women to show their faces not their makeup this has become the me philosophy as many are beginning to discover for years i mixed and matched products from various lines to help achieve a flawless perfection for my celebrity clients and the contestants i worked with i finally decided i needed to create products that worked harder instead of me doing more work
3903478 this question is like asking a mom who her favorite child is
3903479 absolutely who doesnt our lifestyles now revolve around the ease and convenience of things i think it also takes out the confusion for people a lot of people dont know what a primer is or does but if it is packaged with the foundation it makes it simple for them makeup should be easy and fun not intimidating
3903480 the opportunity of working with such raw great talent and being a part of such great transformations not to mention idol being the 1 show
3903481 in the midst of the events of september 11th i found great irony in the fact that i fled my country of afghanistan to come to america when i was 8 yrs old and am truly living the american dream here i am making a living as a top hollywood makeup artist when the women in my country were not even allowed the thought of wearing makeup it was then that i decided to go forward with creating the makeup line and having a portion of the proceeds go to women and children in need so i established the in an effort to make a difference and give back

3903489 if the bill before parliament gets the support of enough parties to be passed into law new zealand will be at the mercy of the european carbon market which is the highest priced carbon in the world and where the price is increasingly set by the price of oil and gas
3903490 australia is considering reducing the risk by having one way trading and capping the price of carbon
3903491 the european union scheme only covers around 40 of emissions so a large part of the eu economy does not face the price of carbon and generous allocation of allowances to industry has shielded them from most of the impact of the charges through to 2013
3903492 carbon analysts predict if the us sets up a national cap and trade scheme they will not want to see a wealth transfer outside of the us so they will have a domestic scheme which allows low cost off sets tree planting etc from voluntary markets to keep their carbon price at a reasonable level
3903493 the government promoted this bill on the basis of a carbon price of 15 tonne the un credits that new zealand companies will most likely have to buy are currently trading at around nz 40 tonne and the analysts predict the gap between these units and the eu units currently nz 46 tonne with forecast values as high as nz 100 tonne will continue to narrow as the un trading registry gets established in the next few months meaning we will be paying dearly for our emissions
3903494 we are very excited to have scott on board because he brings exactly the right expertise to lead this forward thinking project through its implementation stage and beyond

3903550 where a diligent member of the delaware bar provides a very timely synopsis of the cases that come out that often inspires the academics to muse about the impact
3903551 the thing about this blogging business is that it sort of becomes an alternative universe
3903552 for internal purposes it has made us a better law firm
3903553 the blog summaries tend to be very short thats inherent in the nature of blogging
3903554 whats important is to get the holdings right and put each case in perspective that perspective requires a fair amount of experience and background
3903555 i think we are still in the infancy of online networking
3903556 most of them are using it to enhance their reputation as a thought leader
3903557 they tend to be well spoken in the niche area of law they represent so it certainly is an effective marketing tool
3903558 it certainly can enhance their practice both in marketing and the quality of services
3903559 to blog effectively you are entering into an ongoing conversation and referencing what other blogs may have said
3903560 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3903561 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3903562 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3903563 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3903564 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3903565 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3903566 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
3903567 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
3903568 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
3903569 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3903570 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
3903571 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
3903572 lots of computing capacity and storage and at low cost
3903573 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3903574 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3903575 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3903576 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
3903577 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3903578 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
3903579 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phony corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies
3903580 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3903581 this allows for a snapshot view of the relationship between fishermen and government staff and the development and implementation of marine regulations of a commercial fishery that has both economic and scientific significance
3903582 our research identified a significant gap between what people say and what they do when it comes to protecting sensitive information online
3903583 but its not like the box jellyfish where theres a good chance youre going to die
3903584 i can safely say that yu suzuki is in fact still a sega employee
3903585 the law has definitely been due for an update and these recommendations go a long way to improve the act and bringing it into a more modern framework
3903586 where i do think the commission has missed the boat is with areas where it couldve taken the next logical step
3903587 its hesitated from doing that in particular because of its reluctance to deal with the impact of software as a service as realised in things like social networks where people and businesses share personal information
3903588 throwing more education at an issue doesnt really deal with the issue from a regulatory perspective
3903589 i think they shied away from that area maybe because they didnt see a way of solving it
3903590 its very early days for most of this technology and its use and application in society and business its good to be careful about but i also think its a little weak to just say we need education about this and make young people behave how we want them to
3903591 i dont think thats really grappling with the changes that are going on
3903592 im anticipating that over the next five to ten years a lot of what we currently do through email and instant messaging will become embedded more in social network type of interaction where our email is being conducted through that online identities
3903593 so i think the commission has missed an opportunity to make a big step forward and say
3903594 using the holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of european jewry
3903595 the aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts but subsequently rendered in the manner previously indicated more tender and more widely diffused nor could we check our sympathy if so urged by hard reason without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature
3903596 the commissioners who were in charge of the report at that time wouldnt have had a mobile phone or a pc on their desk no digital cameras no e tags e mail no e anything there were no high speed computers for individuals or private industry with which they could do data matching and data mining and no high tech surveillance cameras
3903597 for every task and mission that came across his path ronnie gave it 100 percent
3903598 its a great image for us to keep and to have how he never stepped away from a challenge but always meet the goals he had
3903599 we dont understand the incredible way that people young adults are winning gold medals donating countless hours of community service and also signing on the dotted line to serve our country
3903600 let us remember that family is a gift from god and that ronnie stood out as an incredible example as he blazed a trail up american flag mountain he blazed a trail in our lives in our hearts hes been a shining glowing example for us many times
3903601 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission
3903602 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict
3903603 the fertilizer business enjoyed improving nitrogen fertilizer prices in the second quarter while high crude costs and weak crack spreads limited our petroleum business
3903604 the outlook for our fertilizer business is positive the business is exhibiting upward momentum from an already strong performance in recent quarters
3903605 fertilizer prices have continued to rise and market demand is strong midcontinent refining margins have improved somewhat from recent lows but they continue to be below historical levels in aggregate the improvement in our fertilizer business helps offset weakness in our refining business
3903606 are there any men who are interested in meeting a funny open tom boyish honest and not too bad on the eyes woman who will treat you with all the respect you give to her and at the end of the day is simply human

3903608 many people know chris jericho as a wwe legend but he is also a musician and the lead singer of his own band fozzy
3903609 chris is someone who has worked hard to get to where he is today and that experience makes him a valuable resource and mentor for these women vying for a chance at stardom
3903610 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew that the governments policy was actually causing harm

3903612 may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3903613 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3903614 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this
3903615 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3903616 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3903617 i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job in america whether that candidate is a republican or democrat or an independent
3903618 i think hes been an exciting person on the political stage he has energized a lot of people in america he has energized a lot of people around the world i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for

3903633 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3903634 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3903635 this turf belongs to taxpaying citizens not to hustlers and drug dealers we are going to pop them in the head

3903645 in addition the growing scope of riskier unregulated activities a financial profile that has improved but still lags our expectations and the likelihood that the companys discretionary cash flow position will remain negative through 2009 contributed to a downgrade

3903663 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3903664 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse places on earth
3903665 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3903666 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3903667 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3903668 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3903669 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3903675 the national telecommunications and information administration an agency of the department of commerce is the show stopper here
3903676 theyre the only department of the government that isnt on board with securing the domain name system and unfortunately theyre also the ones who commerce deputized to oversee icann
3903677 the biggest difference is that once the root is signed and the public key is out it will be put in every operating system and will be on all cds from apple microsoft suse freebsd etc
3903678 the only one you have to have to go down the tree
3903679 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
3903680 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
3903681 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat
3903682 we are committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely affect the operational stability of the dns
3903683 while there is increasing pressure to secure the dns ntia must work with all stakeholders and consider all possible solutions
3903684 currently dnssec is the only mechanism known to protect against the kaminsky attack
3903685 it is not clear that other solutions will provide the same level of protection as dnssec
3903686 then the issue becomes political because there seems to be the perception that the introduction of a key guardian changes the current policies
3903687 we would want to bring the editing creation and signing of the root zone file here
3903688 i think any bloke whos honest about their lives can point to times in their lives when theyve got it wrong

3903691 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
3903692 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
3903693 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
3903694 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
3903695 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
3903696 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
3903697 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
3903698 if we can alter the brain why not control it one potential use involves making soldiers want to fight

3903706 it was really the brainchild of ubisoft and them working with our integrations team and sales development team
3903707 we assess every title on our network for ad relevance and work with the publishers to make it happen if a game is set too far in the future or is historical or is a fantasy piece we pass on it assuming the game can be integrated with ads we look for placements that work in the games environment were looking to not over commercialize the looking to find the best placements in the game as we look at it we want to put in about five to six minutes of ads for every hour of gameplay that players experience the reality is that we want placements that catch the players eye and dont saturate the environment
3903708 through the integrations weve already worked into the game weve tagged placement for ads before hand we didnt have to re architect the game at all
3903709 ubisoft worked with ad packaging on the idea we just had to put together a series of events that was compelling to the gamer and the marketer as well and it just works well for the sku in all ways it worked out perfectly
3903710 it makes such a good fit for paramount because of the way the movie and game match up
3903711 promotions like this can be done in numerous markets this could be done in consumer package goods to soft drinks paramount is one of our first advertising partners and one of our most consistent customers the stars aligned the paramount team loves innovation and firsts and trying new things and then also ubisoft has been one of our best if not most progressive publishing partners i think weve carried six clancy games and its because they not only create great games but also because theyve been early in their adoption of dynamic ads

3903754 hes sitting over there about 20 yards away youre relationship was based on always randoming running into each other do you not see the irony
3903755 i thought i was bad ass until i hung out with those guys
3903756 they are the guys who smuggle illegals back and forth over the border
3903757 what border patrol calls illegal immigrants who have made it into the us they cant call them wetbacks or spicks because obviously those are racially charged names and mexican isnt accurate since a lot of illegals are not from mexico so they say tonk they call them that because its the sound made when you hit them on the head with a mag lite
3903758 i told you those guys were nuts anyway so there we are four trucks on this hill like 200 yards from the hole in the fence we are totally blacked out wearing night vision goggles and we can clearly see the coyote hustling about a hundred tonks through the fence the border patrol guys wait until all of them are through the hole and about 50 yards into our side when all four trucks simultaneously turn on all their spot lights and sirens of course the illegals shit themselves and bust ass back to the border and in the darkness they all run right into the concertina wire it was a fucking mess some of them did not make it
3903759 nope you think our force continuum is loose these guys shoot anything they want you should see their situation reports for deaths theyll take out guys with rifles at 100 yards and write in the report subject was threatening agent with a rock its a joke

3903773 if you watch along youll get a huge reward we believe our audience is smart talented and interesting and we want to cater to those people
3903774 we wanted to stay away from anything that resembled network television
3903775 anything that felt like regular tv was either altered or tossed out
3903776 every audience member viewer holds a piece to the puzzle every opinion is valid
3903777 was triggered by a bunch of us neocon saber rattling
3903778 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3903779 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3903780 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3903781 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3903782 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3903783 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3903784 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3903785 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3903786 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3903787 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3903788 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3903789 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3903790 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3903791 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3903792 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3903793 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3903794 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3903795 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3903796 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3903797 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3903798 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3903799 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3903800 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3903801 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3903802 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3903803 the metaphor of eating a book a biblical metaphor has echoes of cranmers prayer that we read mark learn and inwardly digest holy scripture that requires the cultivation of disciplines and habits of attentiveness practices which are robustly discouraged in the conventional experiences of everyday life in what is increasingly googles world
3903804 on 3 august we worked on good time woman and when i arrived the following day i found mick taylor playing bass i hung around until 3am then left
3903805 i remember writing the riff upstairs in the very elegant front room and we took it downstairs the same evening and we cut it
3903806 had a lot of friends at that time who used to fly to las vegas for the weekend
3903807 tumbling dice was written to fit keiths riff its about gambling and love an old blues trick
3903808 i know we had a hundred reels of tape on the basic track that was a good song but it was really like pulling teeth it just went on and on and on
3903809 are drugs really a big issue for 4 year olds are the juicing up
3903810 cost less than 150 for all three of us which was a fraction of what the airfare would have cost
3903811 oh just this article on the famous quidditch player belth oh his sooo cute
3903812 if i had known sooner i would have selected you as a bachelor girl too
3903813 dont worry charlie im fine im just a little scared thats all
3903814 you sleep like a log but it seems you know exactly when the food is ready
3903815 well breakfast is the most important meal of the day mione
3903816 today at ten i need to go to the ministry of magic where my marriage will be arranged and ill be meeting my betrothed
3903817 yes it is the ministry wants every pureblood matched as soon as possible
3903818 ill be leaving in 10 minutes you are welcome to come with me and wait until 10
3903819 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3903820 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3903821 independent democrat and fervent mccain supporter who is also pro choice likely wouldnt fare well with many conservatives either
3903822 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3903823 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3903824 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3903825 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3903826 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3903827 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3903828 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3903829 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3903830 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3903831 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3903832 on a scale of 1 to 10 the pressure should feel like a 3
3903833 en esta casa se siguen las reglas de la termodin mica
3903834 if we cannot watch tv how come he can listen to music on his computer in the community room
3903835 new horizons has been offering cisco courses and certifications for some time with this new relationship of being a cisco learning solutions partner we are elevating our level of commitment and dedication to providing the highest quality cisco courses to businesses and to individuals who want to further their careers with cisco certifications
3903836 we are very proud to be able to partner with cisco because their market leading technology has helped to revolutionize the industry and our new horizons training will help take businesses and individuals to the next level
3903837 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them
3903838 its not only youth filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
3903839 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
3903840 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and traveling
3903841 nobody plays the college football business like alabamas 32 million man is he worth it
3903842 there are coaches at other universities who have similar salaries like charlie weis at notre dame and pete carroll at the university of southern california but no coach including those in the professional leagues can match sabans combination of money control and influence saban now entering his second year as the coach of the alabama crimson tide is the most powerful coach in sports
3903843 the level of attention he pays to detail was surprising
3903844 it was all sort of eye opening to be right at the nerve center of a football program
3903845 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons
3903846 he could calm everyone down and make us work together

3903850 borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure are understandably in a stressful position and eager to seek a potential workout that could resolve the delinquency
3903851 we are focused on developing innovations to expedite the process and facilitate communication between customers and loan servicers we believe that cscs new tool has the potential to reduce the inbound call volume regarding workout status by as much as 30 percent this is critical in freeing staff to focus on the larger picture of preventing foreclosures
3903852 this web accessible inquiry capability is a natural follow on to our recently launched earlyresolution counseling portal
3903853 servicers are struggling to keep pace with increasing loss mitigation volume and the accompanying increase of inbound calls from borrowers inquiring about their delinquency resolution status this solution will help alleviate both issues
3903854 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3903855 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him
3903856 driven millions of small farmers off their land and claimed it as their own

3903859 the technology that we are using today has been in place and in full operation since 1934
3903860 office connector really ramped up our adoption of the wiki across the company
3903861 those not familiar with wiki editing now have a much simpler way to publish and edit the wiki through microsoft office
3903862 the new search capabilities are a major bonus to users all around search is easier faster and more intuitive
3903863 weve also made improvements to some of our most popular macros galleries and charts in addition theres a new pagetree macro designed to make documentation management much easier
3903864 this represents not only the best integration with microsoft office of any enterprise wiki application but also a very smooth experience across both microsoft and atlassian products
3903865 sometimes we forget about them the rebels every day they say they are fighting for the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3903866 i am not in any way saying that the khartoum government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure should be exerted on both sides
3903867 they will have to end on a negotiation table because militarily its clear no side can win the war in darfur
3903868 but if you have 15 20 parties wanting to go to conference table to talk nothing will come out of it
3903869 unfortunately we are sent to the boxing ring with our hands tied behind us
3903870 but we will try kickboxing if we cant do hand boxing
3903871 pico d is an exceptionally smart looking product but after you carry it in your pocket and use it for a while you realize that theres much more to it than handsome looks very few other usb drives can measure up to the pico d in features performance and quality
3903872 our engineers and manufacturing people fussed over minute details for months before we took pico d to production so the finished drive has an unmatched feel of quality to it
3903873 you know weve closed down in the last years 2 school buildings in the area and we thought what better than to have the name unity because we truly are coming together
3903874 it took us 8 years but now theyre all coming back home
3903875 we cant wait until thursday when the first day of school is
3903876 certainly to see the kids faces when they come in for the first time
3903877 we understand that education is definitely reading writing and arithimetic but its something far greater than that
3903878 this is something that the greenville area and this whole area here can feel proud about
3903879 and know that their children are going to be well taken care of
3903880 i think you could probably save the most money buying bulk things pasta flour baking products sugar
3903881 and if you can divide them up with somebody thats the way to save money
3903882 its really a group of people banding together to increase their purchasing power

3903890 really low prices and they should be of very good quality thats the only thing we look at we would never look at anything else we would discard anything else that doesnt fall into those boundaries
3903891 we could match or exceed record high temperatures friday and saturday

3903902 we are going to sit down and we will work with the chancellor and the board of regents to see how we can accommodate their ideas
3903903 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
3903904 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3903905 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3903906 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3903907 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3903908 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3903909 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3903910 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3903911 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
3903912 social democracy is still here in all its variants defining our entire respectable political spectrum from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right we are now trapped in america inside a menshevik fantasy with the narrow bounds of respectable debate set for us by various brands of marxists it is now our task the task of the resurgent right of the paleo movement to break those bonds to finish the job to finish off marxism forever
3903913 we hebben meer namen af moeten keuren met de naam veld er in helaas
3903914 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
3903915 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
3903916 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3903917 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
3903918 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
3903919 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the defense contract audit agency dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments

3903922 the operational improvements we have put into place are beginning to pay off while net revenues declined year over year due to general economic conditions and their resultant impact on consumer budgets the benefits of our low fixed cost model are reflected in our strong profitability and record free cash flow of 29 2 million
3903923 the acquisition of helio offers an excellent opportunity to expand our addressable market into postpaid and significantly increase the value we can provide our customers through new data services and feature rich handsets the additional liquidity and improved capital structure anticipated from the deal will benefit our business financially and strategically and we are looking forward to the closing of the transaction in the third quarter
3903924 there was a dislocation of the elbow but the bones are not broken
3903925 they just put it right back but i think hes lost the rest of the year
3903926 we heard a series of excellent presentations from all the candidates in this important election and were impressed by the range of ideas and the quality of all the candidates
3903927 i want to offer a very sincere and heartfelt apology to those that have suffered from the profiling that has been done
3903928 i want to apologize to those citizens who feel they havent received equal treatment or protection
3903929 we need to not only enforce the law we need to have equal treatment and equal enforcement
3903930 i dont want it to get to the point where our officers are fearful to go into those communities and fear theyre going to get retaliation from the council and everybody else who seem to think these officers are doing something wrong
3903931 we have a problem here so we need to figure out a solution to the problem

3903946 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative

3903958 george washington long ago warned america against entangling alliances and he was right
3903959 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3903960 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3903961 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s moreover washington itself set a precedent for russia when it intervened in kosovo a decade ago attacking serbia to win independence for the separatist ethnic albanian majority
3903962 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security

3903982 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3903983 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3903984 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make

3904056 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3904057 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3904058 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3904061 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3904062 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

3904067 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3904068 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3904069 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3904070 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3904071 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3904078 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3904079 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

3904083 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3904084 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3904094 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3904104 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3904105 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3904106 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3904107 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3904108 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3904109 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3904110 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3904111 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3904112 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3904113 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3904114 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3904115 can regular exercisers do even a smidgen of an olympians workout
3904116 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3904117 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3904118 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3904119 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3904121 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3904122 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3904123 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3904124 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3904125 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3904126 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3904127 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3904128 in my 16 years in this field ive noticed a trend that when the economy or unemployment rate starts slipping we start receiving way more calls lately weve been very busy much more than usual

3904132 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3904133 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3904134 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3904135 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3904136 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3904137 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3904138 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3904139 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3904140 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3904141 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3904142 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3904143 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3904144 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3904145 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3904146 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3904147 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3904148 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3904149 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3904160 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3904161 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3904162 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3904163 africa is proving to be a vibrant emerging market with a climate that fosters growth africa is thinking out of the box and is committed to be self sufficient without the tag of a third world continent
3904164 africa is officially open for business and ready for take off
3904165 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3904166 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3904167 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3904168 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3904169 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3904170 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3904171 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3904172 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3904173 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3904174 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3904175 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3904176 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3904177 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3904178 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3904179 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3904180 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3904181 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3904182 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3904183 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3904184 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3904185 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3904186 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3904187 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3904188 im going to skip the second hill and just head back to the car
3904189 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3904190 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3904191 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3904192 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3904193 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3904194 oh youre not french so how come you speak french then
3904195 eerh this is oldoinyo lengai mam 100 miles away and half the size of kili
3904196 its good to keep everything simple but not too simple
3904197 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3904198 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3904199 get the hell out of there or the only hole youll get is a six foot deep hole

3904204 hell gehenna where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched
3904205 jesus is referring to the maggots that live in the corpses on the garbage heap when all the flesh is consumed the maggots die jesus is saying however that the spiritual decomposition of hell never ends and that is why their worm does not die
3904206 do not fear those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell
3904207 the master of our fate the captain of our soul
3904208 scripture sees hell as self chosen h ell appears as gods gesture of respect for human choice all receive what they actually chose either to be with god forever worshipping him or without god forever worshipping themselves
3904209 i have a personal relationship with a loving god and yet i dont believe in jesus christ at all
3904210 my god is too loving to pour out infinite suffering on anyone for sin
3904211 love so amazing so divine demands my soul my life my all
3904212 the results of his suffering he shall see and shall be satisfied

3904266 i dont have a family or a mortgage so im not in too bad shape
3904267 and it comes at a time of the year when its sort of nice to have some extra time off but in general im living on my savings its dropping
3904268 its good for the economy here because these people do have a job to go back to
3904269 doesnt always work out but in a large number of cases weve seen that it has
3904270 the downside is that the costs dont fall proportionately with the hours
3904271 if you still have to maintain benefits and so on two half time people are still more expensive than one full time person
3904272 interment will take place at a later date due to a government snafu

3904289 that the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life liberty and property and when the government assumes other functions it is usurpation and oppression
3904290 the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom for in all the states of created beings capable of laws where there is no law there is no freedom for liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others which cannot be where there is no law and is not as we are told a liberty for every man to do what he lists for who could be free when every other mans humour might domineer over him but a liberty to dispose and order freely as he lists his person actions possessions and his whole property within erty within the allowance of those laws under which he is and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another but freely follow his own
3904291 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
3904292 the basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government but the constitution which at any time exists until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory udly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government
3904293 we rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government
3904294 sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself can he then be trusted with the government of others or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him let history answer this question
3904295 though the people support the government the government should not support the people
3904296 nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one citizen or one class unless other citizens and other classes have been forced to send it in
3904297 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
3904298 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
3904299 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
3904300 the word of sin is restriction o man refuse not thy wife if she will o lover if thou wilt depart there is no bond that can unite the divided but love all else is a curse in this goddess has warned all there is no other bond all paths lead to love further nuit goes on the stipulate delivered from the lust of result is every way perfect
3904301 invoke me under my stars love is the law love under will nor let the fools mistake love for there is the dove and there is the serpent

3904410 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3904411 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3904412 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
3904413 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3904414 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3904415 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3904416 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3904433 credit issues are always a problem but we treat every customer that comes through the door with respect whether they are able to finance and buy or not credit is nothing we want someone to feel bad about
3904434 we dont do a lot of financing in the new car business or with credit cards so we arent feeling the increase from that but our lending is constant

3904452 the murray arts center was conceived as a vehicle for providing professional training for gifted young people and as a catalyst for expanding the local arts community
3904453 combining those related but idiosyncratic purposes called for a unique vision randall paulson designed a superb building but the theaters rehearsal rooms video production and audio recording studios required a very specialized skill set wsdg has strong credentials in media production recording broadcast theatrical venues and in music performance halls such as nycs jazz at lincoln center complex their work for san franciscos expression college for digital arts the university of colorado floridas full sail the university of michigan and other schools confirmed their aptitude for developing innovative and flexible educational environments they were eminently qualified to serve both aspects of the project
3904454 the multi purpose design program we developed for the murray arts center represents the culmination of a five year project
3904455 sr project manager romina larregina led our team of designers and consultants making numerous site visits throughout the design and building process to monitor the architectural construction process and consult on the myriad technical acoustic and aesthetic issues that inevitably arise during a project of this scope
3904456 i focused on two primary elements of the complex the recording studio program and the theatrical performance areas
3904457 our basil switzerland based acoustic experts general manager dirk noy and senior acoustician gabe hauser specified the speakers amp amplifiers for the theater sound system their computer generated room modeling programs confirmed the speaker placement the measured system performance during the tuning phase perfectly matched their predictions
3904458 acoustically sensitive recording studios and live performance rooms are among the most demanding of all the building arts
3904459 having a knowledgeable person on site and particularly one capable of identifying and articulating problems before they are set in stone can save clients substantial amounts of time and money
3904460 the murray arts centers primary role is to serve the mount paran christian school students
3904461 beyond that mission the center will also provide a valuable community resource by hosting a variety of performance events these will range from full scale performances by the resident 75 member cobb symphony orchestra to theatrical productions by local regional and nationally recognized artists
3904462 these include a fully flyable concert shell fabricated to optimize reflection control over 1 million in acoustic treatments including fully soundproof rehearsal rooms and a 250 000 flying concert shell these elements ensure the absolute optimum listening experience
3904463 the mount paran christian school sits on 65 acres of land purchased from the murray family in 2001 the center will serve as a tribute and permanent memorial to the family and their generosity to mpcs students and the community with our rich family history and strong ties to this property the foundation is thrilled to create this legacy for stuart and eulene murray

3904492 russias ongoing actions raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region bush said today at the white house in washington he said he was concerned about reports that russian forces continue to move through georgia in spite of an agreement on a cease fire

3904500 each game its going to be something different and how we view our opponent
3904501 to be able to sit down there and judge our players against the personnel we have on offense at the skill positions day in and day out is a competitive situation so well be able to go into the game with confidence when we play whoever we play

3904514 the entire antarctic campaign will cost us a couple million dollars but our biggest expense is fuel as fuel prices increase
3904515 its sort of a good thing though because it increases the fuel prices for the whalers and they are paying a lot more than we are
3904516 as long as we can keep the japanese whaling fleet on the run we will continue to cost them money and we will continue to save whales
3904517 i dont think they can go three years in a row with these kinds of losses all we need to do is get down there keep chasing them and prevent them from killing whales

3904601 let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching
3904602 i need a sign to let me know youre here all of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere i need to know that things are going to look up because i feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
3904603 the heavens declare the glory of god the skies proclaim the work of his hands day after day they pour forth speech night after night they display knowledge
3904604 since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
3904605 show me your ways o lord teach me your paths guide me in your truth and teach me for you are god my savior and my hope is in you all day long
3904606 to honor god by reaching people with the good news of jesus christ and teaching them to become fully devoted followers of him
3904607 i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord
3904608 perhaps the most common complaint was that worship services were boring it wasnt just that they werent interesting they werent worshipful they did little to help people meet god however i did not hear this as a call for more entertainment but for more participation
3904609 i believe youll find these are the exact same measurements as our gym back in hickory

3904614 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about
3904615 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3904616 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
3904617 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
3904618 the positioning is the main thing im having a problem with
3904619 its high time the yukon government followed the example of other canadian jurisdictions and pass consumer protection legislation setting maximum allowable fees
3904620 that means they basically have the ability to charge whatever rate they want
3904621 it is really an exceptionally high amount that these businesses are able to charge people who are often not in a very good financial position or they wouldnt be going there in the first place
3904622 what happens now is that payday lenders will compete with each other to provide lower rates to attract customers
3904623 every province in the country should be constructing legislation and regulations to do two things protect the consumer and allow for a viable competitive industry
3904624 thats the single largest problem in the industry and every province must outlaw the rollover and the extension of an outstanding payday loan for a fee
3904625 millions of canadians use the service for a variety of reasons
3904626 they have bank accounts credit cards sears cards look at all those forms of credit they have and payday loan is just another form of credit
3904627 we visited other boutiques to make sure we were on the same page
3904628 we liked the location and there really arent a lot of boutiques here in clear lake
3904629 our goal was to have brands you wouldnt see at the mall
3904630 i want women to feel comfortable here and enjoy themselves
3904631 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3904632 i have been encouraged by the direction weve been going in
3904633 im happy theyre doing it but i know that it will be gone after november
3904634 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks
3904635 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
3904636 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
3904637 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3904638 de la confianza que se le ha prestado en este pa s en un pa s amigo de m xico en donde ha venido a inmiscuirse en pol ticas internas cosa que siendo l ex presidente debe saber con absoluta claridad que no lo puede hacer

3904646 shes definitely trying to poison the jury pool her hope is that the racism of this region will convict me
3904647 this is the best the party could come up with
3904648 and as such are closer to the middle ground between the two extremes this doesnt automatically make them better but it makes them more moderate
3904649 which is easier to find a true laissez faire market or a democrat who advocates state ownership of all means of production
3904650 quando voc olha para traz e v que os dias n o s o iguais
3904651 the church is the gathering of gods children where they helped and fed like babies and guided by her motherly care grow up into manhood in the maturity of faith
3904652 as far as what i am doing shopping for a fuel efficient car to replace the old gas guzzler
3904653 if its not too much to ask what state do you live in
3904654 i bought vegetable seeds there this spring for ten cents a packet
3904655 tonight im blowing my july entertainment wad on the sox yanks game 7 50 beer and all big papis back in the line up
3904656 reaching out for the man upstairs cause thats what hes there for
3904657 as for budgets we are pretty bad about making keeping them
3904658 wow when i was in grad school i made twice as much money as we do now and had 3 fewer people to feed where did it all go
3904659 yes hi can i have the artery clogging burger with cheese and cardiac arrest
3904660 there have been at least three special elections for seats that democrats havent held in decades and they won them all
3904661 i have no illusions that the south has always been republican but it has always been conservative
3904662 when president johnson a southern democrat signed the civil rights act of 1964 into law it was seen as a betrayal by the southern christian racist democrats who as the 60s became the 70s bailed on the democratic party and became the southern christian racist republicans we know today trent lott for example however their overall philosophy racism nationalism militarism christianity has remained the same only the party affiliation has changed
3904663 yes sarge get with the program there have been at least three special elections for seats that democrats havent held in decades and they won them all
3904664 the whole freaking country is obsessed with race humanity has always been concerned with race
3904665 seeeeeeeee we like these black people but not because theyre black nooooo because they agree with me
3904666 anytime in 20th century usa that any attempt was made toward integration be it the benny goodman sextet of 1939 or any of the above examples you ignore anytime the attempt was made the american right wing would go hysterical
3904667 i dont know who you heard talking but in the 1950s and 60s and 70s those words would be coming from southern democratic politicians and sheriffs and justices of the peace
3904668 you shall not take the name of the lord you god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain
3904669 his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all
3904670 show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
3904671 youve just got it all figured out kerry dont you
3904672 the right sees people as nationalities the left sees an earth that has no natural borders
3904673 when was the last time your church turned worship service over to an individual an atheist lets say
3904674 didnt happen wont happen because the group congregation flock would be hysterical that this individual doesnt show any desire to join them
3904675 the idea that religious people are individuals is hilarious really
3904676 why on earth would you take a time dedicated to learning about god and turn it over to someone who doesnt know anything about him
3904677 in order to display an opinion view that is not already held by the group
3904678 religious groups are attractive to people who need to feel part of a community the idea of living outside the protection of the herd frightens them
3904679 they feel that individuals are just poor lost souls who havent yet been invited to join their group
3904680 what is the goal of christians efforts to proselytize but to undermine individuality
3904681 if christians truly valued a diversity of people and opinions they would have no interest in proselytizing
3904682 then what the hell are you doing reposting it here
3904683 but those are human actions they have nothing to do with the technology
3904684 came together to work and struggle and sacrifice for that better life
3904685 old people the obama picture showed two young hip guys smiling cool putting you in mind of two modern dudes on their way to a party it was the worst pictorial choice i have ever seen from a pr standpoint unless ap is working for the obama campaign which i wont rule out
3904686 cars is thougher because of the infrastructure needed to be built to gas up the cars and we cant have the public gassing up their own cars with this stuff too dangerous for the stupid people i see on the roads everyday gotta hire people to do it for you adds to the running cost
3904687 and what would such a thing mean to you anyway sf
3904688 ultimately by reacting negatively to this bill atheists and supporters of darwinian evolutionary theory are proving their opponents right they are acting like reason and the facts are not on their side this could be enormously damaging to their cause
3904689 i wonder if this law would let me bring in supplemental material to a sunday school class
3904690 so why would they have an appreciation for books that require you to put forth more effort and brainpower than the bible
3904691 given the fact louisiana is not only one of the poorest but least educated states in the union only a quarter of its population above 25 graduated from college
3904692 only a quarter of its population above 25 graduated from college
3904693 most people are poor because they have no clue about how to get ahead
3904694 yah a republican governor solves everything whatever considering the state has been largely conservative since the beginning of time and yet hasnt managed to come close to the education level and wealth of states like new jersey and massachusetts tells me that bobby isnt going to do much for them
3904695 i dont have a problem with alternative views being taught i dont think the students will benefit if this takes their time away from science
3904696 oh i suspect bobby is quite smart its the population that elected him and rubber stamps his ideas that i am worried about
3904697 science is taught in science classroom not religious beliefs on how everything came to exist thats not science its creationism
3904698 creationism is not a theory it is not falsifiable there is no scientific way to test it
3904699 evolution is falsifiable there are loads of ways to test it and it has been tested time and time again
3904700 evolution is a scientific theory similar to how gravity is theory theory yes scientifically speaking but generally speaking gravity is fact
3904701 evolution is fact there is little dispute for this in the scientific community
3904702 any form of creationism should be taught in comparative religion classes there is no room for non scientific matters in the science classroom
3904703 were only asking questions why wont you let us ask questions
3904704 one of central factors in christian belief is that man is somehow separate from the rest of creation yet all you have to do is compare the genetics of humans to all other creatures on earth and you will discover we are related to all other animals and we are related quite closely to a few those few strangely enough are apes
3904705 but some bible thumping moron with his 10 seconds of scientific analysis about the equivalent of what creationists spent wouldnt know that because he is well a moron
3904706 er that should have been the tasmanian wolf not devil
3904707 i dont think you want a true public forum with the likes of dawkins et al
3904708 anyone hear that evolution violates the laws of thermodynamics creationists have been spouting this for years and the answer to their criticism is out there but creationists keeping spouting the same bullshit because they know some poor dumb sap that has been programmed to distrust science will still believe them
3904709 in fact the only part of evolution that cant be demonstrated 100 to be true are macro changes but not because macro changes dont happen but because the laws of physics and the limitations of the human lifespan dont allow us too
3904710 to think that we need alternate explanations or need to have other ideas expressed in opposition to current highly regarded theories is great the only problem is that it needs to be done using science and scientific method if you want to poke hole in evolutionary theory go ahead but show us how using the same methods scientists use give us data give us peer reviewed papers give us science
3904711 i also find a bit of hypocrisy on kerrys part when she has absolutely no problem defying gods will when it comes to saving people from viruses and bacteria god created to kill us who else created them
3904712 and yet she thinks we are going to hell by preventing a life from coming into the world via genetic screening
3904713 the charts dont line we have been bringing far more people into the world than god ever intended
3904714 news flash the population of man kind grew at a snails pace for thousands of years until the beginning of the last century which means that 5 billion people who would have never lived otherwise are now alive because we stopped bugs and viruses that god created from killing them
3904715 if god didnt intend for them to kill us what did hes responsible for his creation he is full aware of what its capable of
3904716 unless you are admitting that evolution the uncaring and unthinking process exists
3904717 god unleashed bacteria and viruses on us and he did it knowing full well what they would do to us
3904718 you also have to conclude he intended them to sicken and kill us or he wouldnt have unleashed them
3904719 which means if you are preventing his creation from doing what it was designed to do you are going against his wishes
3904720 news flash the population of man kind grew at a snails pace for thousands of years until the beginning of the last century which means that 5 billion people who would have never lived otherwise are now alive because we stopped bugs and viruses that god created from killing them
3904721 if god didnt intend for them to kill us what did hes responsible for his creation he is full aware of what its capable of
3904722 i dont have a clue so i will make something up
3904723 and as far as sin being the reason i am sure that will go over well with all the babies and young children that have been killed by all manner of diseases and yet didnt have a sin to their name
3904724 we wanted to score a goal and we succeeded in doing that
3904725 secondly we did not lose a goal we had over 60 of possession and controlled the game tactically
3904726 i am very satisfied with this result and happy about the service my team gave me
3904727 we played against a team that wanted to get eight men behind the ball as soon as they lost it we therefore tried to play more directly when we won possession
3904728 we approached the game well arsenal scored because our organisation at the free kick was not okay and not by playing good football
3904729 we made a good start and against top teams you wont get many chances so you have to score when you can our inexperience in europe showed in key moments and that cost us the game
3904730 we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3904731 we were young in the middle of the park and playing at that level you could be worried but i have confidence in my team and i must say that i was paid back very well tonight
3904732 we changed a little bit tactically and they dropped their level to do what they did in the first half tackle for every ball is very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3904733 they made it very difficult in the first half with their man marking my goal wasnt the greatest i have scored but it was still important it was a team goal
3904734 we will direct ourselves to signing a left back we need cover for only this side not both
3904735 the idea is to have a balance in the squad
3904736 we will have two full backs on the left side and two on the right young lamine gassama can do us a service
3904737 black cats is bad luck bad guys wear black must have been a white guy who started all that
3904738 anyway peace out yall and try not to blow yourselves up the lesson beer and roman candles dont mix so well
3904739 name of beer and name of motorcycle company encourage you to live responsibly
3904740 wow beer is responsible and motorcycles are responsible so what could be more responsible than beer and motorcycles
3904741 i see now joe shmoe leader says mccains a good guy so ill vote for him
3904742 obama stands for hope change so im voting for him
3904743 for some of us the economy isnt really affecting us in a personal sense
3904744 this is the nature of transitions of change right now paige you are like a shifting landscape your body a volcano a mountain born from earth your body is an ocean an island springing forth from depths you did not know you possessed your body is a coastline a barrier island reforming its shape your body is a village ravaged by a hurricane but finding again the sun the dryness the land
3904745 i live out in reading but i come down here for work you know ill say hello to anyone i wave smile people look at me like im crazy around here people are closed they come outside cause someones screaming but wont look up to say hi
3904746 he said he liked my stomach i should be sure i keep it this flat he said i was beautiful what have i been doing lately to make this the case
3904747 could the same word which means do great violence to also mean make love to
3904748 the right in the usa doesnt want to learn speak spanish because in the western hemisphere the working class is primarily spanish speaking the right doesnt want to associate with those theyve decided are beneath them
3904749 plus in order to conserve the long history of racism in the usa the right wing is in favor of keeping the usa white and english speaking
3904750 if all the white folks in the usa start speaking or even respecting the spanish language then thats one step closer to the white and hispanic cultures fraternizing working together and gasp having children together
3904751 the 21st century republican party is simply the kkk writ large right wing christian racist paranoid militant and terrified that non white americans might get some respect
3904752 who exactly do i need to speak with that only speaks spanish
3904753 i remind you again democrats founded the kkk the democratic party ran the kkk for half a century allowed it to flourish and used it as a political stepping stone into the good old boys network the kkk is not a republican institution it belongs lock stock and double barrels to the democratic party
3904754 well i say let the market take care of the language problem as well
3904755 you cant get a good job in the us if you dont have a good command of the english language so if the market is as efficient as kerry would have us believe the market will ultimately force people who want a better life to get with the program
3904756 my point if the market takes care of everything we shouldnt have to force people to do anything including learning english because they will do it for their own well being
3904757 did you know kerry that germany using despite declaring german as the official language requires its population to learn multiple languages
3904758 why do you think they do that because they look around them and see reality for what it is
3904759 we need to start prepare for the reality that to keep competitive americans can no longer live in their insular shell and think that the rest of the world revolves around us and english
3904760 that is baracks message its a good one and we should learn from it not blow a fuse and shoot the messenger
3904761 you stupid american hicks in georgia need to become more european teach your kids spanish or something so at least you wont embarrass me and your country when you win the state lottery and stumble over to europe to be loud mouthed rude american tourists try to be more like me i went to harvard
3904762 i think we are pretty close on the practical realities of the situation the only other area where i take issue with those who want to make english
3904763 segments of the population they would rather i assume you intended a
3904764 but i think conservatives are shooting themselves in the foot because there are a lot of conservatives voters they would be excluding from the process if they went so far as to limit voting ballots to english only and i think many of them want that
3904765 that is baracks message its a good one and we should learn from it not blow a fuse and shoot the messenger
3904766 you stupid american hicks in georgia need to become more european teach your kids spanish or something so at least you wont embarrass me and your country when you win the state lottery and stumble over to europe to be loud mouthed rude american tourists try to be more like me i went to harvard
3904767 i think we are pretty close on the practical realities of the situation the only other area where i take issue with those who want to make english
3904768 its not for equality in law its yada yada yada
3904769 so ahmanrah isnt allowed to guess at your motivations but you get to translate obamas pronouncements for us
3904770 plus given the number of times youve told us all what the real motives are for the gay lobby in seeking same sex partnerships
3904771 obamas pronouncements the gay lobby views truely you are the rosetta stone of pme only of course unlike the rosetta stone you choose to do it all in one language
3904772 but i did love you calling him freud and then you corrupting
3904773 so ahmanrah isnt allowed to guess at your motivations but you get to translate obamas pronouncements for us
3904774 plus given the number of times youve told us all what the real motives are for the gay lobby in seeking same sex partnerships
3904775 obamas pronouncements the gay lobby views truely you are the rosetta stone of pme only of course unlike the rosetta stone you choose to do it all in one language
3904776 but i did love you calling him freud and then you corrupting
3904777 i am trying to figure out what your last post has to do with obamas comment about spanish
3904778 are you proving my point that conservatives want to use english and
3904779 first it was enshrining marriage to stop the gay agenda
3904780 then it was enshrining english to stop the hispanic agenda hmm what next i can only imagine
3904781 every time i hear why isnt their a white this and a white that i have to roll my eyes
3904782 look around do you see a lack of white actors on tv
3904783 do you see a lack of white actors getting awards
3904784 no how about straight actors no but guess what blacks at least at one time in the not to distant past could clearly demonstrate they were not getting high profile roles or being recognized
3904785 when could the same be said for whites in the last 200 years of american history and how about gays
3904786 something tells me youd love to see networks dedicated to gays have the legs cut out from underneath them
3904787 so you and others with similar opinions more than justify the rational for their existence
3904788 does it make any difference to you that whites ae 85 of the population
3904789 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3904790 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the cease fire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3904791 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3904792 when we didnt have enough money coming in to take care of the payroll we knew that we had to do something at this end to cut the overhead
3904793 the insurance still goes on the electric still goes on but the payroll was what was killing us
3904794 if i had the work i would put them back to work full time i have no choice but to keep them working three days a week and then unemployed for two
3904795 i dont have a family or a mortgage so im not in too bad shape
3904796 and it comes at a time of the year when its sort of nice to have some extra time off but in general im living on my savings its dropping
3904797 its good for the economy here because these people do have a job to go back to
3904798 doesnt always work out but in a large number of cases weve seen that it has
3904799 the downside is that the costs dont fall proportionately with the hours
3904800 if you still have to maintain benefits and so on two half time people are still more expensive than one full time person

3904804 we did not use any force police did not use any force because there was no need there was no resistance from the other side
3904805 around 0700 0730 there were about 200 to 300 citizens protesters that gathered in front of the municipal and district court in the vicinity and started to throw rocks and molotov cocktails
3904806 police stormed into the building this morning they handcuffed us searched the offices and put us in a police van
3904807 when we were coming out of the compound the van i was in was stopped by serbs who trashed it and freed us

3904824 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3904825 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock
3904826 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
3904827 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3904828 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3904829 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities
3904830 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3904831 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
3904832 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3904833 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3904834 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3904835 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3904836 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3904837 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3904838 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3904839 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3904840 having a local transplant team make the decision more or less on its own under the pressure of getting hearts to help children dying on their waiting lists is not an objective way to establish that criteria
3904841 the public is nervous enough about organ donation without making them wonder if they or their children would be killed or have their death hastened in order to get transplantable organs
3904842 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3904843 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer

3904847 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
3904848 there are just so many hitters that can go up there and hit the ball out of the ballpark

3904852 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
3904853 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
3904854 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
3904855 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
3904856 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
3904857 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
3904858 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
3904859 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3904860 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3904861 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3904862 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3904863 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3904864 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3904865 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3904866 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain

3904871 when we didnt have enough money coming in to take care of the payroll we knew that we had to do something at this end to cut the overhead
3904872 the insurance still goes on the electric still goes on but the payroll was what was killing us
3904873 if i had the work i would put them back to work full time i have no choice but to keep them working three days a week and then unemployed for two
3904874 i dont have a family or a mortgage so im not in too bad shape
3904875 and it comes at a time of the year when its sort of nice to have some extra time off but in general im living on my savings its dropping

3904878 the downside is that the costs dont fall proportionately with the hours

3904908 you could dream that you can travel the world and that you want to be a hockey player but as far as having your number raised to the rafters or being inducted to the hall of fame thats almost beyond dreams

3904915 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
3904916 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
3904917 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3904918 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3904919 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3904920 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3904921 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3904922 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3904923 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3904924 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
3904925 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

3904938 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful

3904940 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3904941 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse places on earth
3904942 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3904943 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3904944 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3904945 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3904946 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3904958 youre never going to have enough police officers to do what you think you want to do does this burden us or challenge us sure but we do we have to sit back and regroup and have to redeploy people to the right places and sometimes we have to take people out of places we dont have the luxury of keeping them there anymore

3905114 when these straight men have sex with other men it is not about an attraction to the other man it is about an attraction to the sex act
3905115 when asked about what they enjoy it is never the actual man but instead his body parts the sexual behavior they engage in
3905116 some have been sexually abused and are compulsively re enacting childhood sexual trauma by male perpetrators some have sex with men because its easier and requires fewer social skills than those required to have sex with women some are gay for pay some like the attention they receive from other men some like anal sex which theyre otherwise too ashamed to talk about or engage in with their female partners
3905117 its just less complicated than with women were both there for sex and thats it
3905118 there are less emotional complications for me many men will do things some women will not and many men give better oral sex i think men will exercise their hunger for sex and not deny that they are horny more so than women they feel comfortable sexually bonding

3905122 the folks at iron horse share my vision for building bikes with real proven suspension technology rather then concocting some gimmick to market for another few years before the next new gimmick
3905123 ellsworth and iron horse agree that the sport of mountain biking grows when folks have a fabulous ride experience on great performing frame designs ict equipped full suspension designs perform better have more energy and great comfort traction and control then any other suspension design
3905124 we believe folks having that level of experience will ride more and tell a friend and there will be more folks riding bikes promoting health and appreciating our planet in an environmentally responsible and healthy way
3905125 this is a very exciting time for our product development department we are looking forward to creating unique frame platforms that carry forward iron horses renowned ride characteristics the goal is to incorporate the key qualities from our existing models with benefits of the ict system
3905126 we are committed to produce well engineered world cup quality performance bikes

3905132 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3905133 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3905134 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3905135 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3905136 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3905142 i think what was truly depressing about my time in ukadcu was that the overwhelming majority of professionals i met including those from the police the health service government and voluntary sectors held the same view the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves yet publicly all those intelligent knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be tough on drugs even though they all knew that the governments policy was actually causing harm

3905150 this is what we feel like we need to do in the economy in order to grow the worst thing we could do would be to go into a defensive crouch so yes we think this is a great time to launch a luxury magazine this is a great time to build out our business and technology sections and add more reporters and editors
3905151 we plan to do more that makes this a place where developers feel more comfortable about working with us the economy is going to come around we need to be in the number one position and we think we are
3905152 in an age where people are cutting we re bringing in new hires for our newsroom with experienced journalists from high profile publications

3905154 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3905155 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3905156 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3905157 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3905158 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3905159 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3905160 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3905161 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3905182 it is very hard for me to accept the fact that it is now very rare for anyone to come into the house of god with guard completely down head bowed and with the silent confession dear lord i am ready and willing to hear what you will speak to my heart today we have become so learned and so worldly and so sophisticated and so blase and so bored and so religiously tired that the clouds of glory seem to have gone from us
3905183 there is no walking uprightly in the dark zeal will cause you to go apace quickly but not at all to go right if judgment guide it not erroneous zeal will make you to do evil with double violence no man can do well which he understandeth not well therefore you must study and take unwearied pains for knowledge wisdom never grew up with idleness though the conceit of wisdom doth no where more prosper this age hath told us to what dangerous precipices men will be carried by an ignorant zeal

3905186 for who will have pity on you o jerusalem or who will bemoan you or who will turn aside to ask how you are doing

3905188 although nehemiah had a highly responsible job in a secure environment in a fine persian city noted for its opulence and prosperity magnificent buildings and spacious gardens he is not remotely preoccupied with himself
3905189 the desolations and distresses of the church ought to be the matter of our grief how much soever we live at ease
3905190 the worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them but to be indifferent to them thats the essence of inhumanity
3905191 providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers it is the duty as well as the privilege and interest of our christian nation to select and prefer christians for their rulers
3905192 the morality of the country is deeply ingrafted upon christianity and not upon the doctrines or worship of other religions in people whose manners are refined and whose morals have been elevated and inspired with a more enlarged benevolence it is by means of the christian religion
3905193 why may not the bible and especially the new testament be read and taught as a divine revelation in the school where can the purest principles of morality be learned so clearly or so perfectly as from the new testament
3905194 human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine far from being rivals or enemies religion and law are twin sisters friends and mutual assistants indeed these two sciences run into each other
3905195 a malicious intention to vilify the christian religion and the scriptures would prove a nursery of vice a school of preparation to qualify young men for the gallows and young women for the brothel and there is not a skeptic of decent manners and good morals who would not consider such a common nuisance and disgrace
3905196 no free government now exists in the world unless where christianity is acknowledged and is the religion of the country christianity is part of the common law its foundations are broad and strong and deep it is the purest system of morality and only stable support of all human laws
3905197 these and many other matters which might be noticed add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a christian nation
3905198 we are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a supreme being
3905199 i believe no one can read the history of our country without realizing that the good book and the spirit of the savior have from the beginning been our guiding geniuses whether we look to the first charter of virginia or to the charter of new england or to the charter of massachusetts bay or to the fundamental orders of connecticut the same objective is present a christian land governed by christian principles i believe the entire bill of rights came into being because of the knowledge our forefathers had of the bible and their belief in it freedom of belief of expression of assembly of petition the dignity of the individual the sanctity of the home equal justice under law and the reservation of powers to the people i like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the christian religion i like also to believe that as long as we do so no great harm can come to our country
3905200 it yet remains a problem to be solved in human affairs whether any free government can be permanent where the public worship of god and the support of religion constitute no part of the policy or duty of the state in any assignable shape
3905201 offenses against religion and morality strikes at the root of moral obligation and weaken the security of the social ties
3905202 christianity has reference to the principles of right and wrong it is the foundation of those morals and manners upon which our society is formed it is their basis remove this and they would fall morality has grown upon the basis of christianity
3905203 what constitutes the standard of good morals is it not christianity there certainly is none other say that cannot be appealed to and what would be good morals the day of moral virtue in which we live would in an instant if that standard were abolished lapse into the dark and murky night of pagan immorality

3905207 the most important prevention is education which should include teaching the children you know that sex is not something casual look ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby i dont want them punished with an std at age 16 so it doesnt make sense to not give them information
3905208 children are a heritage from the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward
3905209 we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
3905210 they standard played very well and we didnt play to our form two weeks from now we will have to reverse that
3905211 we had problems today but we have no excuse standard today proved that we must not underestimate them
3905212 the drive to become thinner is actually secondary to concerns about control and or fears relating to ones body the individual continues the endless cycle of restrictive eating often to a point close to starvation in order to feel a sense of control over the body this cycle becomes an obsession and is similar to any type of drug or substance addiction

3905218 the erlc does not agree that southern baptists have been too timid
3905219 while official southern baptist convention resolutions are not binding on the conscience of any southern baptist they are instructive particularly to those of us who have the privilege of serving all southern baptists through one of the conventions official entities
3905220 one of the responsibilities that accompanies this privilege of serving southern baptists is to seek the broadest possible consensus on issues where the convention has spoken and to encourage change when it is considered appropriate through private discussion and dialogue to reach new consensus rather than public critique
3905221 southern baptist public policy advocacy is most effective when it is supported by the broadest possible consensus among southern baptists
3905222 the ethics amp religious liberty commission has a convention assigned role to express the consensus of southern baptists on public policy matters when they have reached such consensus
3905223 the southern baptist convention had an opportunity at its 2007 convention in san antonio texas to address this issue in the manner it is addressed in a southern baptist declaration on the environment and climate change
3905224 the officially adopted resolution minus the above language is as close to an official position as the sbc is capable of making apart from its formal confession of faith the baptist faith and message
3905225 consequently in our convention assigned role to share faithfully with washington and other public policy venues where the convention is on an issue it would be misleading and unethical of the erlc to promote a position at variance with the conventions expressly stated positions
3905226 given the fact the convention has officially addressed the issues of creation care and environmental stewardship in its 2006 and 2007 conventions through resolutions adopted by the conventions duly elected messengers see links below to view cited sbc resolutions the erlc does not agree that southern baptists have been too timid in addressing these issues
3905227 southern baptists collectively and individually jealously guard their independence and autonomy they reserve to themselves the right to decide through convention action what the southern baptist conventions public policy positions are to be the erlc will continue to share the officially adopted positions of the convention with public policy makers and the media thus the erlc has declined to endorse a southern baptist declaration on the environment and climate change in its present form
3905228 that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life
3905229 simple morality dictates that unless and until someone can prove the unborn human is not alive we must give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is alive and thus it should be entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
3905230 approximately 80 of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation so lets not go overboard in setting and enforcing tough emission standards from man made sources
3905231 governments view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases if it moves tax it if it keeps moving regulate it and if it stops moving subsidize it
3905232 john mccain has publicly stated his support of the state of israel pledging that his administration will not permit iran to have nuclear weapons to fulfill the evil dreams of president ahmadinejad to wipe israel off the map
3905233 solid pro life voting record for the past 24 years
3905234 there are plenty of staunch evangelical leaders who are pro israel but are not anti catholic john hagee is not one of them indeed for the past few decades he has waged an unrelenting war against the catholic church for example he likes calling it the great whore an apostate church the anti christ and a false cult system
3905235 reagan came into the 1976 north carolina primary having lost the first five consecutive primaries to ford the national party establishment was against reagan the media started to write him off and his campaign was broke and in debt needless to say the pressure to drop out of the race was nearly overwhelming
3905236 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament shows his handiwork
3905237 in the end this election has been a lesson in how the media can manipulate elections and create news with phrases repeated often and long enough
3905238 i believe that we need to fund this this is a tough issue for those of us in the pro life community i would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen we need to do what we can to relieve human suffering its a tough issue i support federal funding
3905239 as far as anwr is concerned i dont want to drill in the grand canyon and i dont want to drill in the everglades this is one of the most pristine and beautiful parts of the world
3905240 but sen mccain if you listen to commerce secretary don evans and he just appeared on this program working americans the middle class americans under the bush proposals will get a major break a family of four making 39 000 a year according to mr evans will get a 1 100 tax cut for several years allowing them to plan their individual budgets that sounds like something that wont just simply benefit the wealthy
3905241 o most glorious god in jesus christ my merciful and loving father i acknowledge and confess my guilt in the weak and imperfect performance of the duties of this day i have called on thee for pardon and forgiveness of my sins but so coldly and carelessly that my prayers are become my sin and they stand in need of pardon
3905242 i have sinned against heaven and before thee in thought word and deed i have contemned thy majesty and holy laws i have likewise sinned by omitting what i ought to have done and committing what i ought not i have rebelled against the light despising thy mercies and judgment and broken my vows and promise i have neglected the better things my iniquities are multiplied and my sins are very great i confess them o lord with shame and sorrow detestation and loathing and desire to be vile in my own eyes as i have rendered myself vile in thine i humbly beseech thee to be merciful to me in the free pardon of my sins for the sake of thy dear son and only savior jesus christ who came to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance thou gavest thy son to die for me
3905243 make me to know what is acceptable in thy sight and therein to delight open the eyes of my understanding and help me thoroughly to examine myself concerning my knowledge faith and repentance increase my faith and direct me to the true object jesus christ the way the truth and the life
3905244 it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states
3905245 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them a volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity let it simply be asked where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
3905246 signaling a significant departure from the southern baptist conventions official stance on global warming
3905247 humans must care for creation and take responsibility for our contributions to environmental degradation
3905248 we humbly take responsibility for the damage that we have done to gods cosmic revelation
3905249 apologize to all african americans for condoning and or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime
3905250 a minority of sincere and respected scientists offer alternate causes for global climate change other than deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels
3905251 christian moral convictions and our southern baptist doctrines demand our environmental stewardship
3905252 the supreme standard by which all human conduct creeds and religious opinions should be tried
3905253 we should work to provide for the orphaned the needy and the helpless
3905254 it is time for individuals churches communities and governments to act
3905255 every christian should seek to bring industry government and society as a whole under the sway of the principles of righteousness truth and brotherly love
3905256 we should not be afraid to say the a word abortion
3905257 even now in much reproductive rights discourse this issue is often hidden or implied rather than explicit seemingly in deference to those who still refuse to accept it as a vital part of reproductive health care
3905258 advocates should offer a broad vision of comprehensive reproductive health care that includes not only the continuum of contraception emergency contraception
3905259 linking hiv and reproductive choice reflecting on strategies for advocacy
3905260 the perception of a mandate has not been helpful for us
3905261 on the whole we think its good for businesses to offer these programs which have tax benefits to employers and employees but because its a mandate its harder for us to get businesses to participate
3905262 its a way to help increase public transit in san francisco
3905263 its a benefit for employees that shouldnt cost employers anything
3905264 more places are looking at employer requirements to reduce congestion traffic and pollution
3905265 the concern with this type of legislation is here is another example of the city and county of san francisco not being particularly cognizant of businesses need to be operating their business as they see fit
3905266 how much more of this can it take before theres nothing of it left
3905267 conseguimos colocar a cabe a no lugar e lembrar do bom trabalho que fizemos na pr temporada e especificamente para esta partida a partir da as coisas melhoraram e passamos a fazer o nosso jogo criamos oportunidade e chegamos ao empate e depois no final do primeiro tempo ao segundo gol

3905273 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3905274 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3905275 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this
3905276 and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion
3905277 he cant get his lies and flip flops through to them these people want straight answers and straight talk not half truths and lies
3905278 last we heard about the deal in mid july aol negotiators were

3905293 het was een mooie avond iedereen kan tevreden zijn maar ik ben niet gelukkig en men zal wel begrijpen waarom onze ploeg heeft lef getoond spijtig genoeg waren we voor doel niet effici nt we waren dicht bij een stunt de strijd is niet voorbij al blijft liverpool de favoriet we zullen het maximum geven ik weet niet of de bal van fellaini de lijn heeft overschreden maar we moeten die fase vergeten
3905294 heel jammer dat we niet scoorden we kregen heel wat kansen maar op dit niveau moet je die afmaken
3905295 op voorhand hadden we getekend voor deze 0 0 maar nu zijn we toch ontgoocheld in het resultaat we waren gewoon beter moeilijk te zeggen of die bal van fellaini over de lijn was maar normaal kopt hij die bal rechtstreeks binnen en niet op de paal die strafschop moest er zeker in ondanks die tegenslag zijn we blijven jagen op die verdiende treffer
3905296 we hebben de supporters een mooie avond bezorgd tegen zenit waren we vorig jaar europees al sterk nu hebben we nog progressie gemaakt zelf heb ik me goed geamuseerd en bevestigd dat als ik zo blijf verder doen dat er dan iets moois komt op anfield moeten we vanuit de organisatie proberen te spelen al wordt het daar zeker moeilijker in belgi moeten we met deze ploeg natuurlijk elke week voor de zege gaan wij zijn dan ook de grote titelfavoriet zoals zaterdag al bleek in de supercup
3905297 tijdens het eerste kwartier heeft standard ons gedomineerd daarna ging het meer gelijk op en schakelde de tegenstander over op lange ballen wij wonnen spijtig genoeg geen duels hun sterkte heeft ons verrast ik had mijn spelers gezegd dat standard agressief zou spelen en goed georganiseerd ze verdedigden goed we moeten durven erkennen dat standard vandaag beter was
3905298 we wisten dat ze zeker met de voortdurende steun van hun fanatiek publiek een goede ploeg zijn we waren dus niet verrast door hun aanpak we hadden wel wat last met het veld maar dat kan geen excuus zijn we speelden onder ons niveau over twee weken revanche op anfield

3905303 3 the us did not lose because of whatever age the chinese gymnasts may be they lost because they didnt perform well the chinese deserved to win
3905304 now tell me honestly if you really believe they are 16 years old
3905305 the young ones have too much of a great center of gravity put an age limit i cant stand this insane center of gravity
3905306 what kills the karolyis isnt that the chinese would risk the health of their children by throwing them out here before their bones and muscles mature its that the americans wont allow the karolyis to do it too

3905308 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will
3905309 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers russia had to respond
3905310 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
3905311 we understand that the u s is concerned about the fate of this project but the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3905312 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people

3905315 the european union should be able to address its relations with russia
3905316 through decisions about whether or not and how to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3905317 if the eu wants to mediate it has to remain objective and impartial we should be careful about what steps we take
3905318 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation in the last few days
3905319 the tests showed there was no disease on the greens and it was not caused by the fertilizers we used on the greens
3905320 about a week and a half ago the greens started looking bad and our original thought was the fertilizer used on the greens
3905321 but after receiving the report it said the cause was a chemical burn and not from fertilizer
3905322 and weve used all the same fertilizer and no chemicals on all the greens and just those three have been affected leading us to believe it was vandalism those three greens have been in perfect condition all season too up until a week and a half ago
3905323 the ball is rolling true and the putting has been the same on all the greens
3905324 we want people to know that this was not caused by anything our grounds crew did but caused by someone who purposely wanted to damage to the course

3905336 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
3905337 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
3905338 hes got such a unique voice that people would definitely be able to tell that it was him on the track

3905360 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3905361 for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that

3905386 and they said before we go well give you a birthday hug because we had mentioned that in the car that it was my birthday then both of them hugged me at that same time and they left in a hurry
3905387 i thought hey wait a minute those gals hugged me pretty tight i just wonder and i came to the conclusion they picked my pocket when they hugged me
3905388 no i feel like im a goof i was taken advantage of and i let my sympathies and believing in people being honest get the best of me
3905389 its probably one of the worst properties in my district
3905390 taking somebodys property is probably one of the most extreme positions the government can do but in this case the operator is just not capable of managing his property
3905391 its a nuisance property its a blighted property its not providing decent housing for its tenants
3905392 i will fight because i think it is personal against me not against the building because nothing happens here differently than any other of the other buildings around here
3905393 without a doubt they have been extremely helpful in summoning people to emergencies where there are no other phones available the problem is when we receive a cellphone call and the person doesnt know where they are
3905394 but you do need to know what they can do and cant do
3905395 this is the week that i look forward to and most of my staff look forward to because these are kids that really need a fun day

3905398 so i wanted to make it possible for them to come up and enjoy themselves
3905399 well these people shouldnt be fed well they did something wrong and deserve to be in jail

3905413 you have to be there it is a major sales event it is advertising
3905414 you want to be there to be a conduit for information because clearly we have controversial issues in canada and the last thing that we want to be is shy we stand behind our technology
3905415 what we need now is an objective discussion and accountability and this doesnt seem to be creating the proper context for what needs to be a very frank and open debate
3905416 right now we have officers that are being called into question because of controversial uses
3905417 the rage right now is that people are recording police officers with their cellphones
3905418 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another

3905421 an inspector will be directed to carry out the order on friday
3905422 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong
3905423 the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here but it does present a risk and our priority is to remove that risk
3905424 in this country we have skills shortages and we have a changing demographic and telstra will do all it can to retain our staff and to provide the best incentives it can to ensure that we have the workforce we need going forward
3905425 this is an agenda which is about dividing the workforce not providing all the facts to the workforce
3905426 what these documents do is expose that strategy and were determined to make sure that telstra workers and the general public know what telstras agenda has been about
3905427 theres an implied threat that those people who dont sign up dont agree theyll be punished by a 12 months wage freeze there are suggestions of merit based increases but in fact on our estimates thats a paltry amount of 85 dollars a year so in fact this is a significant agenda to reduce telstras costs
3905428 the whole of the federal governments proposed agenda is about good faith bargaining and people are entitled in australia to have a right for a collective agreement if workers want that
3905429 this is not something that just happened it has been unfolding ever since putin took power and with growing intensity in the past five years part of it has to do with the increase of russian power but a great deal of it has to do with the fact that the middle eastern wars have left the united states off balance and short on resources as we have written this conflict created a window of opportunity the russian goal is to use that window to assert a new reality throughout the region while the americans are tied down elsewhere and dependent on the russians the war was far from a surprise it has been building for months but the geopolitical foundations of the war have been building since 1992 russia has been an empire for centuries the last 15 years or so were not the new reality but simply an aberration that would be rectified and now it is being rectified

3905469 he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3905470 should his assistance be needed on the potential problems with the project
3905471 i think the point here is that the plea agreement laid out robert moultries intentions and whatever they were they seem to be misdirected because the mississippi land water and timber resource board was overseeing the project
3905472 theres nothing in the plea agreement that shows musgroves involvement in this in any way
3905473 musgrove asked the facility group for the contributions and musgrove was the one who cashed moultries tainted check

3905483 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3905484 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3905485 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3905486 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3905487 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3905488 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001

3905490 consistent with the allegations of amy lawler the enclosed documents allege a former assistant attorney general who was the supervisor of the medicaid fraud control unit a federally funded investigative unit dishonestly instituted unwarranted legal actions which she knew were clearly frivolous and completely lacked merit for corrupt purposes
3905491 a supervisor later told her that the suits would stand up to scrutiny if they were challenged as being frivolous
3905492 performed tasks that seem to fall outside the scope of his duties as a medicaid fraud prosecutor
3905493 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
3905494 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
3905495 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
3905496 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal
3905497 the timing that was laid down gave me much greater freedom in paris i could adapt the physical action of the kidnapping but i needed to have liams emotions in a single shot and he gave me that in barely two takes

3905528 i saw ten dead dogs on the side of the road driving late last night to your apartment and i thought it was an omen so i headed on back home and walked in circles round my room alone

3905533 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear

3905536 a neighbor saw the girls standing there just kind of hanging around like they were waiting for somebody and a few minutes later a small car pulled up and the twins got in the back seat
3905537 and then they drove away and we havent heard from them since
3905538 they look up close like theyre 22 and mentally theyre 10 or 11 theyre very slow mentally they each have dolls and they still play with them and yet their interest is to meet boys
3905539 mr corrodi indicated that the girls had run away from home in the past but had always returned that same day
3905540 these run away instances were never reported to law enforcement
3905541 i dont know if someone is holding them because i think theyd be home if they could get home

3905543 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3905544 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3905545 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3905546 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving

3905558 i never used the r word retirement that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3905559 golf has been tremendous to me and thats one reason i want to stay within the game because i really love it
3905560 but what im not going to miss and one of the reasons im stepping away is that its really hard work to grind every day
3905561 its tough to travel every week ive dedicated my life to it pretty much since i picked up a club its over 20 years its been living breathing eating and sleeping golf so its time golf is part of life but its not life
3905562 if she goes out and doesnt miss practice and playing then shes not coming back
3905563 if she has a couple of kids and stays busy she has no reason to come back
3905564 i think one year at a time and well see how it goes i think it would be great to see her in five six years playing at the u s open or something and we can all enjoy her one more time
3905565 im doing the best i can to stay focused on the game
3905566 its never been about a farewell tour or about saying goodbye other than im here and i want to support each tournament
3905567 but i also want to win im a competitor but having said that i have not performed as well since i made my announcement maybe theres something unconsciously telling me its ok
3905568 lorena is leading the charge now and shes a fantastic person and a great golfer so i feel like the tour is in great hands
3905569 i cant think of a better spot than maybe march meadows in honeymoon bay on vancouver island to wind up my career but you cant host an event there
3905570 but its nice to see a lot of old friends and come back to a golf course that we played before in 1994 thats phenomenal
3905571 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
3905572 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
3905573 if we want to address our economic and terrorism crisis we need political stability in pakistan political stability comes from a reconciliatory approach not a confrontationist approach
3905574 have withdrawn their support for musharraf and they dont intend to get involved in the nitty gritty
3905575 but they dont want him humiliated or dragged through the streets
3905576 we have consistently said that this is an internal matter for the pakistani people
3905577 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
3905578 the bush administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
3905579 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
3905580 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and a real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
3905581 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3905582 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3905583 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed

3905596 the european union has this body which addresses perceived violations of the european human rights convention mr mckinnon believes his rights under that convention have been violated by the u k rulings
3905597 mr mckinnon has never been classified in that manner or treated in that manner as far as im aware
3905598 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime
3905599 at this point and time theres no indication the european court will give any credibility to his argument
3905600 it would be premature for him to believe that he has found a sympathetic shoulder to cry on for all the reasons he didnt prevail in the u k he shouldnt prevail there enough already mr mckinnon

3905617 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3905618 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3905619 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3905620 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3905621 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3905622 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3905623 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3905624 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3905625 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3905626 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3905627 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3905628 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3905629 there are a lot of notions that this is the way college has to be this is the way ive planned on it to be my whole life
3905630 some people are quite vulnerable to depression but it doesnt emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood
3905631 kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment
3905632 i think its harder but it shouldnt be a block to their being successful
3905633 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3905634 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3905635 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3905636 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3905637 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3905638 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3905639 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3905640 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3905641 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3905642 i got it out of my system i guess the first time i beat him
3905643 it was nice to get him back i guess on the olympic level
3905644 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland

3905708 the murray arts center was conceived as a vehicle for providing professional training for gifted young people and as a catalyst for expanding the local arts community
3905709 combining those related but idiosyncratic purposes called for a unique vision randall paulson designed a superb building but the theaters rehearsal rooms video production and audio recording studios required a very specialized skill set wsdg has strong credentials in media production recording broadcast theatrical venues and in music performance halls such as nycs jazz at lincoln center complex their work for san franciscos expression college for digital arts the university of colorado floridas full sail the university of michigan and other schools confirmed their aptitude for developing innovative and flexible educational environments they were eminently qualified to serve both aspects of the project
3905710 the multi purpose design program we developed for the murray arts center represents the culmination of a five year project
3905711 sr project manager romina larregina led our team of designers and consultants making numerous site visits throughout the design and building process to monitor the architectural construction process and consult on the myriad technical acoustic and aesthetic issues that inevitably arise during a project of this scope
3905712 i focused on two primary elements of the complex the recording studio program and the theatrical performance areas
3905713 our basil switzerland based acoustic experts general manager dirk noy and senior acoustician gabe hauser specified the speakers amp amplifiers for the theater sound system their computer generated room modeling programs confirmed the speaker placement the measured system performance during the tuning phase perfectly matched their predictions
3905714 acoustically sensitive recording studios and live performance rooms are among the most demanding of all the building arts
3905715 having a knowledgeable person on site and particularly one capable of identifying and articulating problems before they are set in stone can save clients substantial amounts of time and money
3905716 the murray arts centers primary role is to serve the mount paran christian school students
3905717 beyond that mission the center will also provide a valuable community resource by hosting a variety of performance events these will range from full scale performances by the resident 75 member cobb symphony orchestra to theatrical productions by local regional and nationally recognized artists
3905718 these include a fully flyable concert shell fabricated to optimize reflection control over 1 million in acoustic treatments including fully soundproof rehearsal rooms and a 250 000 flying concert shell these elements ensure the absolute optimum listening experience
3905719 the mount paran christian school sits on 65 acres of land purchased from the murray family in 2001 the center will serve as a tribute and permanent memorial to the family and their generosity to mpcs students and the community with our rich family history and strong ties to this property the foundation is thrilled to create this legacy for stuart and eulene murray

3905777 rare communist who was a true liberal it is not often that one comes across a liberal revolutionary some might regard that description an oxymoron can a revolutionary be a liberal but that is precisely what comrade hiren mukherjee was
3905778 never in the last four years the prime minister congress president or any senior cabinet minister bothered to visit his chatterjees residence to wish him on his birthday but on july 25 when chatterjee turned 79 sonia gandhi herself went with a bouquet a number senior ministers also went with flowers the prime minister too visited him why this sudden love this year
3905779 in the corporate segment dell is by far the number one player in india in the government business we attained 9 market share in a span of five quarters and grew our consumer business by 500 in the first quarter so we are on our way

3905789 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3905791 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3905794 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3905795 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3905796 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3905797 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3905798 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3905799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3905800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3905848 one way or the other we are determined to deny iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them that is our bottom line
3905849 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
3905850 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
3905851 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
3905852 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
3905853 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
3905854 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
3905855 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
3905856 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th e means of delivering them
3905857 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
3905858 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
3905859 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
3905860 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
3905861 i will be voting to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
3905862 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction
3905863 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do
3905864 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
3905865 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
3905866 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real

3906312 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the foreign affairs ministry
3906313 what you see is an industry thats going through an amazing transformation whether its in the product or technology or the workforce
3906314 this industry like most industries has a number of older people the boomers well the boomers are in the process of retiring and in the next few years this industry will be hiring thousands of new people
3906315 the companies like gm and ford and chrysler are becoming smaller theyre closing plants and theyre doing things but the exit of the workforce because of the retirement of the boomers is greater than the downsize so even with that were going to see a smaller workforce

3906319 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3906320 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3906321 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3906322 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3906323 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3906324 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3906325 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3906326 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3906327 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3906328 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3906329 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3906330 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3906331 weve had very crowded trains and our new equipment will not be available for another year so we need a stop gap measure our need a little relief

3906338 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3906339 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3906340 cuando estaba en el aeropuerto de caracas a punto de viajar un funcionario de migraci n me dijo que mi pasaporte era irregular y fue una clara presi n para intentar detenerme
3906341 le dije al funcionario que mi pasaporte que es diplom tico no tiene ninguna irregularidad lo uso en todos mis viajes y le advert que se iba a meter en un problema grande
3906342 sin embargo mi viaje fue aprobado por la c mara de diputados

3906370 this isnt in the article but according to the cwa bargaining committee the company wants its occupational workers to pay 400 a month in premiums and isnt budging a strike may be inevitable
3906371 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3906372 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3906373 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before

3906376 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful

3906382 as touching the gospel which was preached by me i make known to you brethren that it is not after man for neither did i receive it from man nor was i taught it but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ
3906383 when it was the good pleasure of god to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the gentiles
3906384 the gospel which was preached by me was by revelation of jesus christ
3906385 it was the good pleasure of god to reveal his son in me that i might preach him

3906387 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3906388 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3906389 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3906390 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3906391 thats the problem with distributed denial of service attacks its really hard to identify the actor
3906392 have experience from the recent attacks of last year that took place against estonia
3906393 the attacks are quite similar in nature there for we have been successful in using some of the lessons learned from april 2007
3906394 as we all know the attribution is what is so unpleasant and dangerous with cyberattacks
3906395 when you take a look at conventional warfare there are no questions or very few questions about attribution but when we look at cyberwarfare attribution is complicated

3906397 our awards are based on the degree of risk people place themselves in in such situations

3906400 some of the common characteristics that are retarding growth in all three states are a significant overweight in auto production a vulnerability to international competition from offshore manufacturers and sluggish population growth
3906401 the employment in toledo peaked in the late 1990s and its been declining pretty consistently since then manufacturing has been very hard hit
3906402 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3906403 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3906404 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before

3906413 we expect that market to continue to grow at a significant rate for the next two to three years and theres a lot to play for

3906415 the emerald colored comet and m33 were a fantastic late christmas gift for me
3906416 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3906417 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse places on earth
3906418 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3906419 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3906420 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3906421 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3906422 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3906423 gt i was honestly looking for pics of hot girls to prove that there really are some in oregon but i came across far too many of these first couldnt resit
3906424 we started as many jobs by april of 2008 as we had done in all of 2007
3906425 if we stay on track were probably going to grow by about 40 percent this year
3906426 weve got them all the way from texas to the arctic circle
3906427 ground source heat pumps have the lowest life cycle costs in several cost studies that ive done
3906428 for commercial buildings where you have a fairly large heating and cooling load the payback period could be two to three years
3906429 between 2005 and 2007 our revenue increased by 200 percent
3906430 the suppliers are backlogged and a few of the companies are six to eight weeks out from being able to send us everything last year the high density polyethylene pipe we use was really hard to come by
3906431 right now we dont have enough installers and we dont have enough drillers
3906432 ive got drillers who are booked out for six months
3906433 were bringing in folks who arent necessarily career hvac guys
3906434 even folks who have no skills are interested in learning because its such a growth industry
3906435 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
3906436 we really didnt get any data that made us feel any better about the financials
3906437 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3906438 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride

3906448 we made her break down this is totally our trinny and susannah moment
3906449 today kevin07 will say sorry to us because his ancestors stole my poppys nanna
3906450 because half of her skin was white and the other half was brown her mummy was an aboriginal and brown and her daddy was white so her mummy wasnt allowed to keep her
3906451 it feels like im trapped inside something maybe a giant plastic ball
3906452 i could hear the radio and i said the baby is safe they have them
3906453 she collapsed in my arms it was a beautiful moment
3906454 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3906455 despite analysts negative responses to finnairs second quarter results the national airline of one of europes smaller airlines should be giving its 55 8 government shareholder a fairly comfortable feeling at present
3906456 with a young short haul fleet and a potentially bullet proof asian focussed network finnair shares some of the positive attributes of the gulf airlines including a very strategically positioned home base its low cost profile also offers a good platform for profitable growth
3906457 accredited businesses differentiate themselves as quality operators meeting the challenges of discerning customers and accreditation provides a point of difference and a branding advantage
3906458 the role of cities as networks of economic activity comes from the rise of service providers in the areas of law accounting insurance management finance and design
3906459 cities that are going to lead the world need to be connected to flows of capital they need to be visited by tourists they need to have satellite offices of the worlds biggest firms
3906460 its much much harder to go from 90 to 92 than it was to get from 70 to 90
3906461 were putting online 120 to 150 new properties a month at the moment so its quite a lot weve had a very good year

3906466 allotz is a competitor but theyve been saying that theyre going to launch in australia for the past year now
3906467 theyve got some technology but they havent got a customer base and they havent got the set of channels that we have their offering has to be pretty damn strong to come in and compete
3906468 i wouldnt like to be them entering at the moment i know how hard it was for us when we first started
3906469 i believe keeping staff silent is both unethical and unreasonable
3906470 this attempt to gag workers occurs at a time when luxury hotel workers feel compelled to talk about the devastating impacts of the labour shortages on their industry
3906471 staff in starwoods queensland sheraton mirage hotel have told us the hotel is demanding they sign a global media policy which specifically states that inquiries from government officials and unions relating to industrial matters must be referred to the hr manager
3906472 we believe this would have the effect of muzzling workers who wish to complain about workplace issues we wouldnt be surprised if they adopted this approach with the rest of their staff around the country
3906473 threats to dismiss workers who raise their industrial concerns with their union or the workplace ombudsman are almost certainly unlawful and may carry a substantial penalty
3906474 there is a major labour market crisis in hotels which is reflected in their 48 annual staff turnover the highest turnover of any industry in australia
3906475 starwood have been asked by the majority of their workers around the country to deal with this crisis but so far they have failed to respond we believe starwood has given workers no choice but to look at exposing this crisis publicly and in response starwood threatens to sack them
3906476 theyll get nothing unless we can find where the money has gone
3906477 we have more questions than answers at the moment at the moment its all a bit bizarre
3906478 why would flight centre be a willing party to subterfuge why was it a party to multi million payments over an extended period of time for a transaction that as far as it was concerned involved only two terminals with a total monthly cost to it of less than 100
3906479 i suspect the mood among the creditors is that some of them will put up the funding to allow that to happen

3906525 we are excited about receiving the best first class honour which highlights the strength of our new cabin design as well as the superior service provided by our cabin crew
3906526 when we look at more localised studies reporting etc we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3906527 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate

3906547 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
3906548 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
3906549 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3906550 hes been pretty courageous about going into places where he wouldnt expect to have a lot of support
3906551 i just want to say that i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be sen joe lieberman i ct or ted kennedy
3906552 we are getting a level of detail for ad targeting purposes in order to target content as well
3906553 this is what we feel like we need to do in the economy in order to grow the worst thing we could do would be to go into a defensive crouch so yes we think this is a great time to launch a luxury magazine this is a great time to build out our business and technology sections and add more reporters and editors
3906554 we plan to do more that makes this a place where developers feel more comfortable about working with us the economy is going to come around we need to be in the number one position and we think we are
3906555 in an age where people are cutting we re bringing in new hires for our newsroom with experienced journalists from high profile publications

3906560 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3906561 throughout this process the council has sought to get the public involved in helping to shape this important document
3906562 we are now entering a particularly crucial phase so it is really important that people continue to engage so far residents have shown a great interest in the plan and their views have helped to create the current document
3906563 the plan is all about the island and how it will develop so i believe it is essential residents play their full part in formulating the document
3906564 iowa has 14 starters and 51 lettermen returning from a 6 6 team that snapped the programs six year streak of bowl game berths
3906565 if the hawkeyes have better luck staying off the injury report they should have little problem getting back into the bowl picture
3906566 among the impact players who have a clean bill of health are tight end tony moeaki and receiver andy brodell two starters who missed the final eight games because of wrist and leg injuries respectively
3906567 their returns should help the offense which ranked last in the league at both 316 3 yards and 18 5 points per contest
3906568 i mean thats probably a nice way to say it they were poor but i think if you examine the reasons why it doesnt take a you know hall of fame coach to figure out what the problems or concerns were
3906569 ferentz was referring to the teams injuries but his players numerous run ins with the law were at least a distraction
3906570 no wonder ferentz wants to distance himself from the past for that to happen his players will have to keep their noses clean avoid injury and most important win games
3906571 at iowa that hasnt been as simple as it sounds
3906572 the best thing we can do right now is do what were supposed to do
3906573 pretty simple on the field off the field in the classroom if we do that i think people are fair
3906574 now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably
3906575 in and of itself a breath of relief for many players who were wanting that kind of unabashed magic in the game and a cause for stomach churning for people who are really into the lore that think were going to suddenly turn it into flying wizards and stuff like that

3906591 if obama makes supporters work 6 hours just to hear him speak i shudder to think what he will require of mccain voters if he actually gets elected
3906592 the problem got worse today when i got three phone calls from three different people at the obama campaign office asking me to bring food for the staff i had signed up to donate snacks but i didnt realize i was supposed to feed the whole staff just thought youd want to know that the problem goes way beyond just the confusion about the tickets i have no idea how obama can win colorado when the campaign office is such a disaster
3906593 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
3906594 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the un is back the un is back to stay
3906595 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
3906596 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
3906597 the iraqi people are not ready to take over for themselves
3906598 iraqis do not yet know how to run a government and it is going to take some time to make this government function
3906599 it brings the whole un organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
3906600 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
3906601 they go into these classrooms and they have their idiot union teacher standing up in front of them giving them all this crapola about global warming
3906602 are presuming that they dont have an ideological kook in front of them they presume that they have a committed educator who is presenting facts rather than some liberal unionized hack thats presenting a pile of garbage thats being tossed out there by a failed politician
3906603 so these kids are going to end up when they realize that global warming was all a scam and they learned it you know they learned it in school they so deeply believed theyre gonna end up with an incredible distrust of everything thats not all bad any time we can break someones trust in a greedy overpaid unionized schoolteacher thats a good thing rather than a bad thing
3906604 you know what a fruitcake your teacher is your teachers been voting for one left wing hack after another after another after another the only thing that your teacher does his entire summer is take a look at his pension statement to watch to figure out how much money hes gonna make when he gets to retire when hes 55 years old
3906605 do you think that they even are aware that up here in the upper midwest weve been freezing our butts off all summer no they dont know that
3906606 george washington was the president the north beat the south in the civil war
3906607 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3906608 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3906609 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3906610 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3906611 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3906612 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3906613 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3906614 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3906615 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3906616 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3906617 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3906618 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3906619 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3906620 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3906621 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3906622 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3906623 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3906624 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3906625 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
3906626 el estado no dar marcha atr s con el retorno de esos sujetos a vista hermosa para que vuelva a mandar puesto que la mayor a de los internos rechazan su presencia porque se trata de la moral los principios y los derechos del colectivo
3906627 ya estamos como lo hemos hecho en otra oportunidad conversando directamente con los privados de libertad adem s tenemos otras instituciones trabajando de la mano con nosotros tales como el ministerio p blico y la defensor a del pueblo que ya cuenta con una representaci n en el sitio para establecer los enlaces y di logos con esas personas
3906628 las experiencias en ecuador m xico y recientemente en los ngeles nos han reafirmado que indiscutiblemente el fen meno musical del que todos formamos parte sigue vivo despu s de 30 a os
3906629 este pa s puede prepararse muy r pidamente para construir 200 mil viviendas al a o si me lo permiten yo pienso alcanzar ese ritmo tengo que preparar las estrategias para que se puedan construir viviendas en un h bitat digno por su puesto hay un aspecto financiero que nos dice si lo vamos a poder hacer o no
3906630 estas personas no tienen ninguna posibilidad de ser legalizados esto no quiero decir que no sigan manteniendo el derecho a la vivienda
3906631 que ninguna familia pague nada a las ocv hasta que no se est n haciendo los papeles de propiedad de la vivienda el ministerio pagar el terreno y los proyectos que necesiten las comunidades tampoco deben pagar nada a nadie por las adjudicaciones ya que se est creando un sistema nacional de adjudicaci n donde est n fundamentalmente los organismo involucrados en la construcci n de viviendas

3906642 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
3906643 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place
3906644 many world records are being broken at the olympics but that doesnt make the feat easier or the distances shorter
3906645 no doubt the annual debate will surface once again about whether the exams are too easy or have been dumbed down or whether the education system is failing down playing the achievements of schools at exam results time has become something of a national sport
3906646 none of this however should be allowed to detract or distract from the years of hard work pupils and teachers have invested in preparing for these examinations congratulations to all those involved should be the order of the day
3906647 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
3906648 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
3906649 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 of their pupils studying a levels all this shows is that some boroughs have lots of pupils travelling to do their a levels which is very common
3906650 the fact is more young people are staying on in education than ever before
3906651 rather than painting a picture of doom and gloom the tories should be preparing to congratulate pupils on their hard work
3906652 colon cancer is the second leading cancer killer in the united states
3906653 150 000 americans will be diagnosed with the disease and 60 000 will die from the disease this year
3906654 i wish id have started buying your stuff when i first got into online marketing i spent almost 30 000 and 5 years of my time trying to figure out what you just told me in your course
3906655 finally for 9 months ive been scouring the net reading all the info products i could get my hands on and not until today when i read yours did i actually increase my income from one within 24 hours of my purchase its worth ten times what youre charging for it if you ask me
3906656 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
3906657 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
3906658 the very first thought that came to my mind was murder or somebody whos got to kill an awful lot of rodents because years ago cyanide used to be used to kill rats and roaches
3906659 a tablespoon would be enough to kill you less actually
3906660 and put it in a little capsule it is in fact used as a suicide pill just like you see in the movies
3906661 whiskey is for drinkin and water is for fightin over
3906662 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3906663 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3906664 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3906665 every veteran and military member deserves recognition for their contributions to our country
3906666 sgt stewart and his family deserve recognition for their contributions to our country
3906667 its unfortunate the process is taking so long but i am certain sgt patrick will ultimately receive his marker with the wiccan symbol
3906668 the least his country can do is give him the symbol of faith as he would have wished
3906669 while this stonewalling continues family of soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice are still waiting for equal rights
3906670 sgt stewart was shot down by terrorists he deserves to be recognized im holding out hope that my ancestors who fought in the revolutionary war did not do so in vain and that the freedom of religion on which our country was founded will prevail
3906671 the secret of living here happily is to adopt the mexican time frame when you do you will find yourself free from deadlines unafraid to postpone things or be late for appointments
3906672 if guns are your primary issue youre probably not going to like either of these guys
3906673 if youre absolutely not going to vote for mccain or obama on guns
3906674 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3906675 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3906676 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s
3906677 infection can spread to your bloodstream quick in a matter of hours and you die
3906678 debt is the state of owing someone something in the future
3906679 the start of the beijing olympics has done little to fuel peoples enthusiasm for 2012
3906680 people feel that the budget is spiralling out of control and they feel money could be better spent elsewhere
3906681 with income being squeezed in so many ways those looking to raise some extra money may find that their spare room could provide the answer
3906682 demand for rooms is likely to be fairly high too and with the government providing tax free incentives for landlords now is certainly a good time for those considering taking in a lodger
3906683 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3906684 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3906685 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3906686 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3906696 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3906697 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3906698 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3906701 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to grant the english people a referendum on independence for england
3906702 68 of english people want an english parliament 59 of english people want scotland to leave the uk the will of the english people for self rule within the united kingdom is flagrantly ignored because we are told an english parliament within a federal uk would break up the union well maybe english people would prefer independence to being 3rd class citizens within a united kingdom lets ask them

3906705 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3906706 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3906707 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan
3906708 youre going to have one retainer then have braces put in
3906709 the secret of living here happily is to adopt the mexican time frame when you do you will find yourself free from deadlines unafraid to postpone things or be late for appointments
3906710 glenn you are the first member voted off the island
3906711 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
3906712 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
3906713 i think as a new team or as a new partnership between myself mike canney co driver and the whole effort i think everyone has done a fantastic job right out of the box
3906714 i think that the mustang being a little bit bigger of a car little heavier and the roll center being a little bit higher its made me change a little bit as far as driving style and how to handle the car mid corner
3906715 it is ive won there before and we were third there last year its really a survival game as far as conserving the car and conserving the brakes i think we found a brake package that will last in the mustang i think its going to be good for the mustangs so well just have to see i think we found something for the more twisty lower speed corner aspect and im very comfortable there itll be good
3906716 i think the part that i am looking forward to is the relationship that we have with hyper sport im hoping that that relationship works out well and that we will we have better results at the end of the weekend i have a good feeling about that
3906717 all social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision making known as cognitive biases
3906718 we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
3906719 they standard played very well and we didnt play to our form two weeks from now we will have to reverse that
3906720 we had problems today but we have no excuse standard today proved that we must not underestimate them
3906721 i dont know that i have ever seen a dirt track much less drove on one

3906723 frank has been helping me a lot with what i am supposed to do on the dirt tracks
3906724 so it should be quite interesting to say the least
3906725 the funeral was 6 500 i donated 500 to the church the wake food and drinks were another 500 the rest went for the memorial stone
3906726 early case identification and treatment with oseltamivir is key to addressing the high case fatality rate in indonesian cases there is a clear need to identify definite causes for high case fatality
3906727 consideration needs to be given now not in the teeth of a pandemic and not deflected by either proprietary defensiveness or opportunistic profiteering to gauging the comprehensiveness of national surveillance for human h5n1 cases
3906728 londoners and indeed the british public as a whole will never forget the tragic events of july 7th 2005 gill hicks embodies the bravery and spirit of those who were most severely affected

3906731 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3906732 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3906733 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records

3906744 the worst case scenario is that russia decides not to adhere to the peace plan which is still in very outlined form russia may even go as far as to surround or shell tbilisi itself
3906745 that really would be a major international incident it would be extremely counterproductive for russia
3906746 all the eu can commonly agree on is an absence of conflict essentially its role is one of conflict mediator

3906786 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3906787 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3906788 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization

3906792 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere

3906797 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3906798 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3906799 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies

3906814 wed like them to stop hiding from public debate and be accountable to the community

3906817 this feat took me years and thousands to complete this is my most prized collection which i do not want to give up but i have some serious family issues where money is needed now
3906818 then i knocked on the window of the house and opened the front door and just yelled at them to get out
3906819 the older woman couldnt hold on to cup she was so upset
3906820 im not a hero i just did what i did
3906821 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3906822 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved

3906824 i think people who live in canberra do appreciate the way in which its been formed from paddocks basically
3906825 heritage issues are dear to the hearts of many in the community of canberra
3906826 i dont know what our government does period i martin luther king

3906828 anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
3906829 in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3906830 we feel like weve been led down the garden path and our interest in working in partnership and leading our mission as educators is now being used against us
3906831 i think it is more urban im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room this is my best work ever
3906832 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3906833 in my announcement on may 13 i said i was stepping away
3906834 i never used the r word retirement that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3906835 golf has been tremendous to me and thats one reason i want to stay within the game because i really love it
3906836 but what im not going to miss and one of the reasons im stepping away is that its really hard work to grind every day
3906837 its tough to travel every week ive dedicated my life to it pretty much since i picked up a club its over 20 years its been living breathing eating and sleeping golf so its time golf is part of life but its not life
3906838 if she goes out and doesnt miss practice and playing then shes not coming back
3906839 if she has a couple of kids and stays busy she has no reason to come back
3906840 i think one year at a time and well see how it goes i think it would be great to see her in five six years playing at the u s open or something and we can all enjoy her one more time
3906841 im doing the best i can to stay focused on the game
3906842 its never been about a farewell tour or about saying goodbye other than im here and i want to support each tournament
3906843 but i also want to win im a competitor but having said that i have not performed as well since i made my announcement maybe theres something unconsciously telling me its ok
3906844 lorena is leading the charge now and shes a fantastic person and a great golfer so i feel like the tour is in great hands
3906845 i cant think of a better spot than maybe march meadows in honeymoon bay on vancouver island to wind up my career but you cant host an event there
3906846 but its nice to see a lot of old friends and come back to a golf course that we played before in 1994 thats phenomenal
3906847 i can say so far its my favourite place on tour i love that its old and very traditional
3906848 while the national propane code allows such practice the province of ontario and tssa as its delegated administrative authority prohibits truck to truck transfer in the best interest of ontarians and enhanced public safety
3906849 we dont know what happened at that facility that night
3906850 we are absolutely committed to the safety of the public thats number 1 any changes that we make will be based on that
3906851 but other than this incident which is very large and concerning the tssas performance has been satisfactory
3906852 they howled in protest the liberal cabinet ministers did when they were in opposition
3906853 its time for the government to acknowledge this experimentation this flirtation with privatization has been a failure
3906854 its time to restore the regulation policing and licensing of these fueling facilities to restore it to some government body so theres some accountability
3906855 i dont know for the life of me why mr takhar hasnt said by now that every single one of the major transfer facilities in this province will be inspected
3906856 what i want to see is some short term action inspect these plants now and be able to tell people theyre safe or theyre not
3906857 its time they stood up and said there are going to be things done starting today
3906858 they havent even indicated any sense of urgency about it and i think thats a disgrace
3906859 i have no doubt that if they had the ability to get onto these sites before this we could have solved this problem
3906860 we are not trying to do the wild west thing
3906861 there is much debate among firearm owners about whether openly carrying firearms is really a good idea
3906862 while we will leave that choice to the individual we will state that in many urban areas doing so will draw unwanted attention from law enforcement
3906863 porque ellos se encargar n de dar a conocer su propuesta en otra ocasi n
3906864 its a very aggressive and obviously retaliatory move but were not just going to roll over
3906865 imagine youre a working person and all of a sudden your salary gets slashed people can lose their homes just because the mayor wants to retaliate it remains to be seen how well fight back but were certainly not going to watch our members lose their homes
3906866 what they did is an unfair labor practice retaliating against someone who refused to make concessions
3906867 look at the bernal preschool this is a tiny amount of money but its important to the community and he didnt even have the courtesy to call me himself and tell me about it
3906868 its particularly ironic since he talks all the time about keeping families in san francisco i guess that doesnt mean low income families

3906874 some students just dont do well in a big school this is an alternative
3906875 math is the one score we were most scared of because it tends to be tied to innovation
3906876 if we had it our way it would be 220 days but that might have been a shock to 15 year olds
3906877 not to call a football team fat but its not helping us compete against beijing
3906878 hopefully well be able to make sure the students only go to chuck e cheese at an appropriate time
3906879 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners

3906890 in essence what were doing is trying to make sure that during construction all homes regardless of whether theyre built in or out of the city limits get inspections done to make sure that theyre bring built to code
3906891 if that were in effect today im not sure where i would turn and i build a lot of homes outside the city limits
3906892 weve done statistical work to try and see what you know the value of a house is at what point at what level of dollar change does that affect the market as to whos a buyer and whos not a buyer we dont think that this will change that

3906904 the writing had been on the wall for some time for mr edmunds
3906905 one view is that developing countries need to have a safety net against import surges of agricultural products to be able to protect their farming systems and that this safeguard should be easy to use
3906906 another view is that like all safeguards in the gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade and wto the ssm should be subject to certain conditions and limitations to ensure that that it does not hamper normal trade flows and that it should not be abused
3906907 if were going to remove the safety net from american producers we are going to balance that with giving them more economic opportunity through increased exports
3906908 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3906909 i grew up with life magazine which offered these wonderful glimpses into the lives of people that id never meet i think we need to learn more about each other i think it is important to see how many different ways people choose to live their lives the book is like an ink blot test it means different things to different people we wanted to give people lots of different ways to experience it we also did a sister book uk at home they said we needed to do it at the same time whew so we had two teams google let us move into their offices in london and paul mccartney wrote the introduction so it worked out pretty well
3906910 well i have an eight year old and a six year old its amazing how you come to see the world through their eyes america at home came through my daughter phoebe she was going on a sleepover and was nervous what teddy bear should she take what if she didnt like it would i come and get her in the end she had a great time when i picked her up the next morning i asked her what was the one thing that stood oout the most she said dad did you know you that other peoples lives are different than ours then my wife and were talking about it and looking at home in terms of relationships doing this book it made me realize something people hang out with people like themselves there has to be a commonality yet collectively i was stunned at the diversity and seeing how astounindingly different peoples homes are i mean so often the houses look the same on the outside but inside its a whole different story everyone takes the home like a blank piece of paper and draws something unique
3906911 pick a personal photo it might be a digital photo or standard photograph you can scan it use a cropping tool or whatever you can produce your own cover using your own photo you also write the caption it looks the same what youd get in the bookstore except its your personal photo on the cover were the only people that have done this custom cover people are the surprised they really love this feature weve seen some great covers come through
3906912 we spend about three months with researchers in new york just planning wed put the word out via user groups and the internet looking for people with very interesting and diverse lifestyles who wanted to be a part of this project we found people in magazines on the web talked to journalists and of course word of mouth then we sat down and put them all up on a board we had a big map with dots on it and discussed ok weve got too many people in nyc we need more folks from the midwest and so on then we called people up we have a photographer would like to spend a few days with your family 99 9 people said yes
3906913 the thing is people can put up a good face for about an hour and then they slide back into their routine after awhile people just got used to it and didnt even see the photographer anymore also each photographer probably shot 1 000 photos a day so theres a wide range in there
3906914 what we do is develop a concept take creative people give them the resources and put them under pressure we let them know they are competing and stand back let them produce there is that sense that the photographers are discovering the unseen
3906915 we feel strongly that the books are made by the editors i often say that its like doing a jigsaw puzzle but you lost the box you have no idea what the picture is supposed to look like well we ended up with about 250 000 photographs which all arrive digitally that come with rudimentary captions we then have writers go back and re write the captions yknow people think that coffee table books are always so nice and perfect like hallmark cards and we wanted to make this one true to life some of this is evident in the layout of the book for example we included a woman being evicted from her home and then on the next page is 10 000 doll house its different things for diffeent people two realities theres another example theres a shot taken chinatown in nyc an entire family packed into one room on the page next to it a house with so many rooms theyve got secret rooms behind bookcases with these books we are always fighting the prejudice of what is this some patriotic thing im proud that this not a disney or a hallmark thing these are real people living their lives
3906916 its like taking a pebble and skipping it across the surface of a lake theres not goal to try and be fair
3906917 jennifer is the organizer she does the budgets spreadsheets and databases i do fundraising we also take turns on the creative side of it our company is three people and most of our projects are done like a relay race passing the baton we have a tiny office in sausalito california my wife and i have been working together since 1983 and we didnt have kids until eight years ago the books used to be our kids since we do a book every 18 months it is like having a kid we probably would never see each other if we didnt work together she should have been a lawyer shes got an amazing mind i should also mention that my wifes father is he is one of the worlds great photojournalists and a hero of mine
3906918 yes but im way too close to the project so i submitted my photos under an alias i didnt want anybody to choose them to suck up to me
3906919 there are so many but there is one on a double page spread it shows a line of kids some of them handicapped riding bikes and wheelchairs to avoid a storm this florida couple has adopted so many handicapped children and i just love the background and the variety of their circumstances and yet all just kids
3906920 we invited any body with a digital camera to participate we got the word out through snapfish google ikea wed give out daily assisngments morning rush dinner time and so on about 10 percent of the book came from amateurs we got tons of baby pictures and people asleep about 150 000 photos came in an amazing response
3906921 its kind of schizophrenic these days wed been living in mill valley california for the last 20 years but last year we moved to the upper west side of manahattan having two kids i feel outnumbered ive never been so tired in my life its a three ring circus the kids adore new york central park is my backyard but they miss their friends in mill valley weve got friends cat sitting for the year we are gone i like the gentleness in northern california everything is crowded here in new york also i miss my walks up in the hills in mill valley i dont know we havent decided yet if well stay
3906922 thats the big challenge with our books people think coffee table books are so bland and just flip through the pages we wanted to provide more than just the photos im so glad you enjoyed the essays i was floored when matt groening agreed to write the forward we were so excited that writers of this stature would want to participate david pogue is a friend of mine and hes so prolific amazing the influence he has the statistics were great in terms of providing a 30 00 foot view compared to the personal view that the photos provide it helps illustrate a full picture that 1 5 of or country doesnt speak english at home or that most people live within 50 miles of where they were born ive always loved statisfitcs but they are much more interesting within the context
3906923 this publisher does books like this all over the country
3906924 it was a great opportunity to do this here in carrollton there are so many great photographs here
3906925 im still getting a check and its not going to arellanos financial services its going to a federally insured bank
3906926 they started out with the best of intentions but things got out of hand in their heart of hearts they were trying to do the best they could for people
3906927 if youve never seen them move on to something you have seen and that you know exists in reality
3906928 they preyed on elderly vulnerable people they used their language and their heritage against them
3906929 the offender did go out and purposely target the victim
3906930 he was viewed as a strong forthright christian gentleman scholar and i think were all deeply saddened by his loss
3906931 cool to see you bla bla bla new hang out friends in the making catch you soon
3906932 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3906933 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3906934 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3906935 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3906936 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3906937 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3906938 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3906939 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3906940 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3906941 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3906942 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3906943 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3906944 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3906945 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3906946 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3906947 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3906948 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3906949 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3906950 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3906951 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3906952 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3906953 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3906954 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3906955 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3906956 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3906957 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3906974 members are angry the employers want to lock them into 2 5 per cent increases for the next three years while inflation is still rising the 2 5 per cent pay offer is already a pay cut
3906975 the employers locally have said that they cant afford a better rise but they agreed that they didnt need to raise council tax and they have saved 6m over the last year in efficiency savings efficiencies that have been delivered by our members
3906976 it is time for members to share in the savings

3906989 our approach and tools help the business owner manage this important detail in a strategic systematic achievable approach

3907000 certainly recommendations were made at the time they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end theyd changed
3907001 probably due to perhaps a few different reasons you know the labs can now detect very minute traces of chemical also the recent flood events certainly may have had some impact in washing chemicals off

3907011 decreased funding by the national institutes of health has created enormous pressure on young researchers and the marketplace of current medicine with its increased demands to be clinically productive further constrains the time they can devote to research
3907012 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research
3907013 im pleased that great research has the opportunity for funding
3907014 weve sold some special cars during our 37 year history but this mg ranks among the most significant vehicles to ever cross the barrett jackson auction block

3907016 my good friend in dallas ed wilkins owned the car and let me drive it in the race
3907017 because it was early in my career i still had a lot to learn but knew how to go fast this mg changed my life because from that point forward i knew that i wanted to be involved with racing and sport cars
3907018 in addition to the amazing story this mg is in pristine condition and its track ready
3907019 it would be quite a thrill to drive this beautiful sports car in a vintage race knowing that carroll crossed his first finish line behind the same wheel its truly a collectors dream and will serve as the cornerstone of our inaugural las vegas event

3907022 the acquisition in the open market or otherwise of shares constituting control without offering fair value to all stockholders a partial or two tiered tender offer that does not treat all stockholders equally or other coercive or unfair takeover tactics which the board believes are not in the best interests of the companys stockholders
3907023 is not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company on terms that your board considers favorable and fair to and in the best interests of all stockholders and will not do so the rights plan is designed to deal with the serious problem of unilateral actions by hostile acquirors which are calculated to deprive the companys board of directors and its stockholders of their ability to determine the destiny of the company
3907024 and then theres my current storyline once again i havent a clue what im doing its not even a story just page after page of me whining about porn at some point the readers going to realize that its going nowhere that theyll be no payoff no epiphany no nothing

3907032 this is a very important moment for the birds as they take their first flights into scottish skies they will be facing many challenges in the years ahead and like others ill be crossing my fingers that they find their way and breed in the future
3907033 the sea eagle is one of the cornerstones of scotlands species re establishment programme and it will be an incredible experience for more people to see these huge birds in their natural environment
3907034 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watched them grow up and now theyre raring to go
3907035 the re establishment of scotlands sea eagle population range to its former glory is a key part of our species management plans over the next few years this is an important step in that process the presence of these amazing birds in the east will support populations already established in the west and it should bring similar benefits in the form of tourism and quality of life for those in the area
3907036 best film best director best photography best european north or south american film
3907037 some of the most exciting forward thinking cinema today falls under the genre label and deserves a showcase
3907038 in the tradition of the shooting gallery film series were putting together a group of films whose quality far outweighs most of whats on offer from hollywood and what better way to kick things off than with let the right one in which is one of the best films of the year period
3907039 its hard enough finding one film let alone two that are benchmarks within any genre
3907040 were extremely fortunate to have six stellar films future classics in my opinion that will appeal to critics and audiences alike and make great additions to discerning dvd collections

3907044 there is something very strange going on with spacecraft motions we have no convincing explanation for either the pioneer anomaly or the flyby anomaly
3907045 this near perfect symmetry about the equator seemed to result in a very small velocity change in contrast to the five other flybys
3907046 i would be very surprised if we have discovered two independent spacecraft anomalies
3907047 i suspect they are connected but i really do not know
3907048 another thing in common between the pioneer and these flybys is what you would call an unbound orbit around a central body
3907049 for instance the pioneers are flying out of the solar system theyre not bound to their central body the sun for the other flybys the earth is the central body these kinds of orbits just dont occur very often in nature it could be when you get into an unbound orbit around a central body something goes on thats not in our standard models
3907050 we should continue to monitor spacecraft during earth flybys we should look carefully at newly recovered pioneer data for more evidence of the pioneer anomaly
3907051 we should think about launching a dedicated mission on an escape trajectory from the solar system just to look for anomalies in its motion
3907052 theres definitely something going on whether thats because of new physics or some problem with the model we have is yet to be worked out as far as i know a lot of people are trying to look into this

3907109 im so happy that this provides me an opportunity to get a close up look at the success of this festival
3907110 from all the comments ive heard it seems to be extremely successful
3907111 it seems like every time i attend a film festival i get a job in a movie out of it
3907112 there are always going to be film festivals that deal with pointedly focused groups in a community
3907113 a lot will either break out and become mainstream or at least provide a place where filmmakers can get their work seen by a broader audience
3907114 without my training at that school and unc i wouldnt have had the career that ive had
3907115 im like the energizer bunny i just go on and on
3907116 i struggled socially i struggled with my parents it was not a fun time but it was a formative time and it played a big role in who i became
3907117 a lot of people in their 20s and 30s relate because they had similar experiences and parents want to know whats going on with their teenagers
3907118 i think it has that crossover appeal to different generations
3907119 its pretty tame compared to some of their experiences that werent in the movie
3907120 it was impossible for me to stand by and not give my input for whatever it was worth in the end
3907121 i stay friends with the people i make movies about but filming them is a one time thing
3907122 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3907123 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3907124 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3907125 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3907126 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3907127 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3907128 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3907129 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3907155 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3907156 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3907157 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3907158 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3907159 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3907160 we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3907161 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3907162 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3907163 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict
3907164 it just started with a little trickle of smoke i almost felt silly phoning
3907165 an hour later the smoke was more and i didnt see anyone up there
3907166 i left it at that and an hour later it had burst into a ball of flames and i was starting to get a little more nervous and still nobody up there
3907167 shortly after that our private air show started with the planes dumping fire retardant but if they would have attacked it when i phoned at 8 oclock it wouldve been pretty easy to take care of
3907168 i tried not go get too excited or react too nervous because i didnt want to scare the kids
3907169 but when it started to be a big ball of flames i started to get a little concerned
3907170 right now its looking to be under pretty good control
3907171 we wouldnt consider it 100 per cent contained but we have a pretty good grasp of the fire
3907172 theyve got a helicopter flying over top dropping water on it
3907173 but if it does get out of control theres some houses down less than an eighth of a mile lower than the hill that could be threatened by the fire
3907174 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3907175 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3907176 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word

3907183 the government has become a major employer causing a lot of economic problems for the country
3907184 the government has got involved in many economic activities ahmadinejad has turned the economy into a fully state dominated economy
3907185 when ahmadinejad was elected the leader asked us to tolerate his economic policies but after three years the era of tolerating the government on carrying out privatization has ended
3907186 the government still controls many key industries giving control of sectors to semi governmental organizations does not mean privatization

3907212 um dos lugares mais inalterados pelo homem que eu j vi
3907213 avistamos dois bandos por quil metro em uma transec o na gran caldera
3907214 os macacos eram abundantes e tamb m destemidos eu me surpreendi com a ingenuidade deles
3907215 talvez os macacos tenham decidido passar a noite em outro trecho da mata
3907216 ningu m estudou a ecologia desses animais em condi es naturais
3907217 mas agora poss vel fazer isso algu m pode acostumar um bando de drils presen a humana e realizar um estudo de longo prazo
3907218 sem d vida j n o s o mais ing nuos nem t o numerosos quanto em 1986 mas ainda podem ser encontrados em boa quantidade
3907219 a floresta continua intacta mesmo nos locais em que n o mais se v em macacos
3907220 bioko n o parecida com aquelas regi es da frica oriental onde as pessoas derrubaram a floresta at o alto dos montes para a agricultura mesmo assim na frica oriental raramente seres humanos abatem macacos
3907221 vejam os mognos em qualquer outro lugar h muito teriam sido derrubados mas este um lugar remoto e inacess vel demais e n o s o muitos os ca adores que chegam aqui isso o que mant m os macacos relativamente seguros
3907222 ach vamos que os primatas estavam seguros aqui que este um lugar remoto demais para os ca adores mas n o bem assim
3907223 est vendo esta rea n o t o longe da borda norte da cratera
3907224 eles sabem que esta uma rea protegida mas como n o h nenhum controle entram aqui e abatem os animais
3907225 no mercado de malabo comentam descaradamente que carne de macaco da gran caldera
3907226 ningu m vai servir aos membros de sua fam lia uma carne que poderia deix los doentes

3907240 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
3907241 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3907242 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3907243 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3907244 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3907245 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3907246 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous
3907247 apple installing a kill switch and not telling anyone caused a firestorm in the application developer community online
3907248 ya know its such a great feeling to know that no matter what i can call you for whatever dumb reason
3907249 do all they can to support the proposed constitutional amendment
3907250 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
3907251 have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh
3907252 gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose
3907253 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
3907254 the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society
3907255 it wont affect you so why should you care is the common refrain while it may be true that allowing single sex unions will not immediately and directly affect all existing marriages the real question is how it will affect society as a whole
3907256 we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society
3907257 do moms and dads matter evidence from the social sciences on family structure and the best interests of the child

3907265 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3907266 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3907267 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3907268 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3907269 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3907270 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3907271 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3907272 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3907273 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3907274 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3907275 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3907276 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3907277 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3907278 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3907279 m s vale que esta vereda que andamos se convierta en camino

3907283 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3907284 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond

3907286 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then

3907296 they are not going to send you back to the facility again brother you are free now
3907297 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
3907298 certainly we need a week although some experts suggest that two weeks is what is needed to really recuperate
3907299 the important thing is to have some block of time for vacation and not just take a day here and a day there when people do that they usually end up just running errands and not getting a chance to unwind

3907312 if textbooks weekly readers and other classroom materials mention u s imperialism at all its most likely a mere hiccup starting with the spanish american war in 1898
3907313 and vietnam if history teachers make it that far is more often portrayed as a mistake than as part of a pattern of u s imperial policy

3907315 such theorists are not content simply to advocate teaching about treatment of native americans and blacks from a historical perspective they advocate using the public school classroom as a forum to promote the notion that there must be redress now for injustices that whites perpetrated in some cases centuries ago against people of color a classroom focus upon content based history education is in the minds of the theorists woefully inadequate instead promotion of an activist agenda should be a major pedagogical goal beginning in preschool since most multicultural theorists are educating for justice and activism simply teaching about white racism is inadequate because it fails to demand compensatory action and the renegotiating of power relationships

3907328 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3907329 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3907330 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3907331 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook
3907332 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odours

3907343 work is going to take three to four months before we can put in new arrangements and the red lines will be the last thing to go the most important thing is to get rid of the signs
3907344 the road will revert back to the original traffic orders and yellow lines
3907345 the same parking restrictions will apply until we bring in new traffic regulation orders to reflect the extra parking we created we will keep people informed of what is happening
3907346 the only people who will be affected by the changes will be those who abuse the road by staying longer than they are allowed to
3907347 people could end up infringing the law without even knowing because they will be expecting one rule and getting another

3907381 ive begun a personal blog dedicated to sharing all that ive discovered as well as explaining the simple secrets to hopefully enable everyone the means of seeing these incredible hidden images
3907382 there really is no way to prepare you for what all youre going to see
3907383 of course one of the best secrets to seeing these images and illusions much faster and easier is knowing exactly what to look for in addition to knowing how to look in just a slightly different manner than were perhaps accustom to viewing a piece of art these images and illusions can be seen clearly with the naked eye once you know the what and how to finding them
3907384 my most recent blog entry features a sketch by da vinci and is a very simple illusion that will hopefully allow viewers a sense of immediate gratification in being able to see one of these vast number of illusions the type of illusions as well as the style of hidden images can vary from painting to painting and from sketch to sketch once you grasp the concept of a particular illusion or hidden image youll quickly begin to discover more and more of the same within that particular piece of art work

3907397 its not the first research to show a correlation between talent management and financial results
3907398 but its one in a handful and i think it really adds to that body of evidence that is helping organizations to build a solid business case for investments in talent management
3907399 smaller competitors who havent done this work really scramble in a lot of cases when it comes to filling holes in their workforce
3907400 youre too small to do it by yourself but perhaps havent built the infrastructure or managerial focus
3907401 confusion is a word we have invented for an order which is not understood
3907402 reminds me of the way five to seven year olds play soccer players on both teams tend to chase the ball in the manner of a noisy herd they are in effect totally data dependent their approach stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of older kids anchored by a better understanding of the game and more of a strategic mindset the older players seek to maintain positions on the field and rely more on letting the ball do the work

3907406 we hoped that these two policies would have a positive impact and they did
3907407 of course i dont know why they did that but my assumption was that they had alcohol in their bags and they went back and dropped off the containers in their cars
3907408 we seemed to deal with a lot fewer intoxicated people
3907409 before people were able to sneak alcohol in pretty easily
3907410 we are working with the state to update the habitat conservation plan
3907411 continued clearcutting of the limited spotted owl habitat on the elliott should stop until it can be shown that it will not further endanger the spotted owl
3907412 in developing the recovery plan and the critical habitat designation we worked closely with the u s forest service and the bureau of land management to identify areas on lands they manage that are best suited for owl conservation and recovery
3907413 in the recovery plan those mocas include wilderness areas and national parks
3907414 we dont believe thats the best way for the owls and for the forests either
3907415 its clear that the fish and wildlife service is setting this up as a free pass to blm
3907416 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3907417 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day

3907420 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3907421 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3907422 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3907423 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3907424 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3907425 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3907426 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3907427 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3907428 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3907429 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3907430 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3907434 they give students research and analytical skills and the ability to work independently on large scale projects which are useful skills in themselves
3907435 they are also what universities look for in their applicants it is why i ultimately want every school to give their students the chance to undertake an extended project
3907436 opportunities to get deeply involved in a subject that interests you to develop research skills to pull together different areas of the other subjects you are studying and to develop extended writing skills will all be enormously valuable preparation for going to university

3907476 my current manager is doing a good job but there are always options in life and you only have to look at the stars nasser has already got
3907477 it depends on what is being said at your club he said hinting at williams attack on coach steve folkes and suggestions of racism
3907478 i see myself as a rugby league player right now but you never know everyone has got their own opinion of what sonny did but he was looking after his own backyard which is understandable
3907479 choc is a great role model because hes outspoken he has balls inglis said
3907480 and despite all the criticism hes faced he wont back down to anyone
3907481 everyone needs to be heard and choc gets out there and says what he thinks
3907482 greg said if im doing anything i will be doing it with you youre my manager thats it
3907483 ive been right through that with him his parents and everything
3907484 he cant afford to have his image or reputation tarnished the way the other bloke williams has
3907485 bellyache coach craig bellamy who is very close to him has been in his ear about that gregs sensible enough to know
3907486 theyve been speaking regularly for 10 years their families are close gregs under contract for two years and hes guaranteed everyone he definitely wont be walking out
3907487 all the speculation has been amusing to greg and to us

3907501 the roycroft campus corporation rcc board of directors staff and volunteers welcomed senator dale volker to the roycroft campus in east aurora ny on tuesday august 12th
3907502 rcc supporters were very honored that senate majority dean skelos and senator dale volker toured the roycroft campus which is one of western new yorks most significant economic development and cultural tourism projects
3907503 the rcc was also pleased to have the town supervisors from aurora elma brant and wales join senator volker in the visit and presentation during his visit senator volker presented a check to the rcc in the amount of 100 000 to be used toward phase i projects to include reconstructing the power house restoring the copper shop and repairing and enhancing the campus grounds

3907532 consumers increasing desire to access social applications such as facebook on their cell phones coupled with flat rate pricing plans will give carriers the opportunity to capitalize on this revenue shift
3907533 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
3907534 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place
3907535 many world records are being broken at the olympics but that doesnt make the feat easier or the distances shorter
3907536 no doubt the annual debate will surface once again about whether the exams are too easy or have been dumbed down or whether the education system is failing
3907537 none of this however should be allowed to detract or distract from the years of hard work pupils and teachers have invested in preparing for these examinations
3907538 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
3907539 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
3907540 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 of their pupils studying a levels all this shows is that some boroughs have lots of pupils travelling to do their a levels which is very common
3907541 the fact is more young people are staying on in education than ever before
3907542 rather than painting a picture of doom and gloom the tories should be preparing to congratulate pupils on their hard work
3907543 i dont know what asset smart looks like but anything is better than today anything is better than going out of business because you run out of money
3907544 it might be a partnership with ibm or tsmc or it might be an outright sale of their manufacturing
3907545 thats something we might expect to see where amd donates the fabs and the other partner donates cash
3907546 it wouldnt surprise me if hector ruiz played a role in running that new joint venture company
3907547 foundries have moved up to a viable model of leading edge lithography that wasnt there before
3907548 your investment thesis in amd has to be that they introduce unique products and return good cash flow to the product side of the business with the assumption that theyre going to be much more like a fabless company than one that is paying for their own process development
3907549 i am disappointed that they have stepped away from this i know that there are practical difficulties and that there were matters of principle that the fashion industry found difficult but i feel the bfc should show leadership on this issue
3907550 i feel that to ask all models to produce a mandatory certificate of health compromises their dignity and potentially infringes their human rights
3907551 furthermore the logistical constraints involved with ensuring all models are medically checked in good time to fulfil work engagements represent an ongoing obstacle
3907552 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

3907555 the new words paint a vivid picture of current interests social trends and preoccupations such as the environment have come through words like food miles and carbon footprints
3907556 weve been watching words like wag a wife or girlfriend of a professional sportsman for a long time but we dont want words that are ephemeral or just the buzz words of the moment
3907557 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3907558 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3907559 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3907560 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3907561 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3907562 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3907563 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3907567 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
3907568 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
3907569 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
3907570 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
3907571 the organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on ethnic minority solicitors
3907572 the sra at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen
3907573 potentially this still leaves the sra open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme black and minority ethnic solicitors
3907574 not to be under estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations
3907575 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
3907576 manipulation and deception some of it of a highly reprehensible kind
3907577 thats an incredible sum fair play to him i am sure his life has been turned upside down with the no smoke without fire school of thought but thats a huge sum
3907578 does that mean that barry george is on to a couple of million
3907579 i would like to buy my council flat where i have lived for over 30 years and i want to put in a new bathroom and kitchen and make a few changes in the garden and of course make sure that i have got food on the table and my bills paid
3907580 the best thing is being able to get off the dole i am a proud man who has never been afraid of work but nobody in the countless interviews i have attended has wanted to take me on
3907581 now i have got a couple of small business ideas i can afford to try out but i want to take my time and not rush into things i am still coming to terms with all the implications that go with the award i am also feeling a sort of peace for the first time since my arrest 15 years ago i am now slowly realising that i have a future after all and that is a great feeling
3907582 not merely an excess of zeal but a blatant attempt to incriminate a suspect by positive and deceptive conduct of the grossest kind
3907583 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the least 16 years but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that is something he will never get
3907584 he is not angry he is hurt and disappointed he is gradually getting his life back on track and this will act as a catalyst colin is realistic enough to realise and accept that his name no matter what happens will always be synonymous with the tragic events of rachel nickells death in some peoples eyes he will always be the bloke who got away with murder

3907593 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3907594 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3907595 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3907596 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3907597 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3907598 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3907599 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3907600 children who do poorly at school are more likely to have been affected by the food they ate many years earlier rather than the chicken nuggets they had at lunchtime
3907601 theres been considerable levelling down to make a levels more accessible to a much broader range of abilities and to serve a much bigger higher education system
3907602 the essay questions tell you the factors you should consider instead of allowing you to decide what the important factors are there is strong evidence that its now easier to get an a but it wont feel like that to the students who are under more pressure than their parents ever knew
3907603 from the point of view of pupils the exams are harder because they are more competitive its not enough to get a pass or a c you need an a or three as to get into the top university
3907604 i would say modern kids are better prepared for the exams i would expect them to score more highly as a result
3907605 certainly they are on dodgy ground with the code of admissions but this undoubtedly happens in the top state schools that want to get the best results
3907606 if the stretch and challenge in the questions does what they are meant to no amount of drilling will help less able students it may be the a could help identify the best students regardless of their educational background
3907607 incredibly useful i used it a lot as did all my friends and even my lecturers the essays explanations and outlines of philosophy are each looked after by a leading philosopher so you feel certain that the info is worthwhile and properly referenced
3907608 without the sourcebook my crusader module this year would have been a lot more taxing and time consuming this is an incredibly useful site
3907609 fantastic starting place for quick and broad introductions to any organism group of interest
3907610 i can use citations from the future and tutors cant accuse me of not being up to date
3907611 all the data predicts that the trend will continue and the a grade will go up by about one percentage point
3907612 fewer applicants have missed their offers that implies results have gone up the impression is were seeing fewer bs than last year so the number of as will have gone up a bit theres a general sense of it being tougher than ever with a slightly lower rate of students turning down offers as well
3907613 it will give us no room for manoeuvre for people who have missed their results because of illness or family issues or other discretionary issues
3907614 we could be up for record numbers of student who get three as who are turned down on that measure yes its tougher on the students
3907615 extended projects are an excellent way to learn skills and even better when a range of research and presentation methods can be used but trying to graft them on to an already crowded and incompatible curriculum is not the answer
3907616 people will be shocked to see there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
3907617 people are getting better at the exams game the government sets up a system and schools and colleges try to play that system thats what they do thats what independent schools have always been particularly good at
3907618 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
3907619 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place many world records are being broken at the olympics but that doesnt make the feat easier or the distances shorter
3907620 youtube can also be an excellent way to not do something productive

3907637 always treated me fairly and gave me a far voice
3907638 i think it would be very interesting to have a newspaper in the state capitol that asked the hard questions the reporters had been very fair but the editorial standpoint it leans to the left i would like to see issues legislation budget discussed from both sides a conservative voice would be heard its something i am going to inquire about and pursue and see where it takes us the truth is the newspaper business is a tough business today revenues are declining readership is declining however having a newspaper the paper of record in the state capitol of a state that will be the largest is a rather intriguing idea
3907639 but in terms of the editorial content there would be a different viewpoint most importantly we would be sure that the conservative point of view would have a clear voice in that newspaper personally i think its a fine newspaper and although it leans to the left it always treated me fairly and gave me a fair voice but overall the tone would be different if there were conservatives as owners
3907640 i would like to announce today that the victoria police board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the victoria police department
3907641 the disciplinary hearing set for aug 18 will no longer proceed due to the resignation of battershill
3907642 the police board will not be paying a severance to battershill we will contribute a sum of 15 000 towards battershills legal fees as part of the settlement agreement the victoria police board considers this matter closed
3907643 a public hearing could be held if the commissioners office believes that the issues are such that they are in the public interest
3907644 the investigation completed by the rcmp did not find that battershill had committed any criminal acts had any involvement with any criminal activity nor did it find any financial impropriety
3907645 we as a police board have acted very appropriately and we are looking after the best interests of the taxpayers
3907646 there are some things within the last nine and a half months that we are unable to disclose only due to the fact that we are bound by the settlement agreement at this time
3907647 his brother wasnt one of the best people in the world but fredy never did anything bad in his life

3907658 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3907659 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3907660 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3907661 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3907662 may demand that naval ships and aircraft of the black sea fleet leave

3907667 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3907668 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the cease fire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving

3907676 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
3907677 before proceeding to study applications that may not make physical sense
3907678 one should differentiate between an isomer programme and what might be called the hafnium programme
3907679 the former has added significantly to the body of science as documented by many peer reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community
3907680 the hafnium program was focused to my knowledge on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and sceptical group it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping yet distinct programmes with quite different aims and outcomes
3907681 this approach differs dramatically from suggestions for use of isomeric materials in explosives applications
3907682 this process requires a resonance between the nuclear and atomic electron transition energies
3907683 in principle these might be adjusted within a high temperature plasma to bring an appropriate atomic transition into resonance with the nucleus
3907684 a secondary role of awe is to provide independent advice to the uk government on potential threats to the security of the uk so an understanding of the fundamentals of isomer physics is essential
3907685 genetic engineering leading to the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3907686 if we were to increase the gap by even a second or two this problem would not have arisen
3907687 enough of a success given that it provides us with the data to go operational
3907688 i used do lots of crazy stuff like fly a fighter plane and drive a mclaren f1
3907689 the suppression of black people just didnt seem like a really good way to spend time
3907690 if someone with a particular purpose in mind enters the area that things will happen

3907692 im extremely optimistic about earth and i think its highly likely to be a great place to live for a long time but not completely likely
3907693 100 years ago there was no atomic bomb who knows what the next 100 years will bring some unknown threats that we could invent to bring about self annihilation then theres also the chance of a super volcano or big meteorite
3907694 you cant compare a sub orbital flight to an orbital flight they will fly to 60 miles and next year we will fly to 22 000 miles its in a different league

3907705 mr ailey he always said dance came from the people
3907706 im not a black anything first of all im a human being and i dont really like being put into a box
3907707 mr ailey was reacting to the fact that we couldnt see our own images up there on the stage he wanted to say something about our beauty about our intelligence about our craft and our experience
3907708 we have evolved and reinvented ourselves but based on the premise that this man thought of a long time ago that dance should be accessible
3907709 and they loved us and we still kept true to our ailey vision
3907710 im the most dramatic change look i dont have hair on my head i had hair 50 years ago
3907711 heart and soul spirit love humor dedication all those corny words we like to use happen to work for us
3907712 i am disappointed that they have stepped away from this i know that there are practical difficulties and that there were matters of principle that the fashion industry found difficult but i feel the bfc should show leadership on this issue
3907713 i feel that to ask all models to produce a mandatory certificate of health compromises their dignity and potentially infringes their human rights
3907714 furthermore the logistical constraints involved with ensuring all models are medically checked in good time to fulfil work engagements represent an ongoing obstacle

3907745 the beautiful statues of antinous hadrians male lover are worth the trip by themselves
3907746 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3907747 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more houses to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3907748 it the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
3907749 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad she sozen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions
3907750 i dont think the critics will be satisfied with such a motion from the prime minister he has to show that he favours further liberalisation of the country and cares about more than just the rights of the muslim community
3907751 we expect inflation to reach its maximum in august of 5 4 falling to around 4 3 or 4 4 in the next three months
3907752 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity should be respected
3907753 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them

3907757 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
3907758 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
3907759 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
3907760 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
3907761 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
3907762 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
3907763 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
3907764 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
3907765 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
3907766 i had watched programmes on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
3907767 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
3907768 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
3907769 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
3907770 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
3907771 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
3907772 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
3907773 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
3907774 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
3907775 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
3907776 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
3907777 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
3907778 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
3907779 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
3907780 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
3907781 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
3907782 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
3907783 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
3907784 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
3907785 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
3907786 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
3907787 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
3907788 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
3907789 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
3907790 it takes a long long time to come to terms with it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is
3907791 she is still young and everything is raw for her she hates the label transsexual she is just a girl who happened to need the surgery to make her genitals right
3907792 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
3907793 the organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on ethnic minority solicitors
3907794 the sra at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen
3907795 potentially this still leaves the sra open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme black and minority ethnic solicitors
3907796 not to be under estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations
3907797 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
3907798 what stands out is the mediocrity of a group of technicians and developers who are well meaning but full of an anachronistic paternalism in the best of cases and are once more using gaud to leave their personal mark on the building to the detriment of the original work
3907799 what they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of gaud it has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes
3907800 this was a disaster because even though they had all the necessary documents regarding the material and techniques to be used they were not followed
3907801 the problem with restoring gaud s work is that by the time there was an awareness of his legacy he had been dead for 50 years
3907802 los que viajan a pie son los temidos los que viajan en auto son los odiados pero los que viajan en bicicleta esos son los amados
3907803 para que se vea desde altamar que poco le sirve al navegante que no sepa esperar un faro quieto nada seria guia mientras no deje de girar no es la luz lo que importa en verdad son los doce segundos de oscuridad
3907804 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics
3907805 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the casualties
3907806 by day five of a conflict one expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured but here there is no information nothing
3907807 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
3907808 the political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the march election
3907809 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3907810 september 2nd tuesday i need each parent to tell their child that they need to be in school
3907811 a lot of teachers pass out their syllabus meet new children new teachers you just miss out on a lot
3907812 whatever i gotta do on the first day of school thats what im going to do
3907813 i dont think they should be out but if its for funding keep them out
3907814 mais ou menos como se os clientes comprassem aqui na record a f rmula 1 e o futebol global de uma vez s por esse per odo todo
3907815 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3907816 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more houses to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3907817 but thats why im ringing you i cant speak to the account holder because somethings gone wrong with your line
3907818 and is there anything else i can help you with today
3907819 keep track of every penny from day one and itll help avoid more serious financial problems later on
3907820 think about simple things like making a packed lunch rather than buying a sandwich
3907821 be sensible and if you have spent a lot one week cut back the next
3907822 keep an eye on how much tax you are paying
3907823 if you earn less than the personal allowance reclaim your tax
3907824 remember your university is there to help you if you have an emergency
3907825 that way you keep more of an eye on what you are spending
3907826 and go to the discount shelves of the supermarket youll have to run on a sunday because everyones got the same idea
3907827 my advice is to earn money by working for your university
3907828 mine pays more than the minimum wage and you get to meet lots of new people at the same time
3907829 many folks have been very busy in the off season accomplishing a long list of improvements to the stadium

3907831 we realized we needed more space we needed better access for our patient
3907832 we needed more to be able to do what we needed to do treatment wise for our patients this is not an emergency room but its meant to handle emergencies that would occur in the stadium and at least try to stabilize the patient for transport minor injuries breathing problems dehydration heat nausea vomiting anything like that well see here a lot of those patients get released and they go back to the game or well advise them to go home or follow up at the hospital

3907845 the declaration of independence was first and foremost a declaration of secession from the british empire
3907846 american was founded by a war of secession the founders could hardly have thought that secession was an illegitimate act when it was what defined them politically
3907847 the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
3907848 southern disunionists openly avowed secession rather than revolution precisely because they rejected the ideal of a natural right to revolution
3907849 no were not convinced by this rhetoric of equality and inalienable rights
3907850 no testimony or other information compelled under the order or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information may be used against the witness in any criminal case
3907851 the inescapable conclusion that the state improperly used the testimony of these officers to indict them as well as the others
3907852 i believe russia decided to quit before the counter stroke could be applied at least it looks that way if you consider the terms of the armistice
3907853 would the counter stroke you forsee involve georgian allies now that follows a different time line doesnt it
3907854 so you keep nixing military options im not satisfied give me a mil option that meets my strategic requirements but adapts to diplomatic initiatives and works within time and logistical constraints
3907855 churchills story provides an exceptional example of strength of character and skills of oratory
3907856 at a time when britain stood alone against hitlers nazi war machine which had crushed much of europe weakened after dunkirk he inspired his countrymen and others with his stirring speeches and his vow never to surrender
3907857 if i could have dinner with anyone id choose winston churchill
3907858 between ww i and ww ii he suffered a very bad time he was out of favor with both political parties out of office and battled financial problems and depression but through it all he stuck to his principles he had a clear vision of what hitler was and was the most vociferous against him if not for churchill
3907859 the most important lesson for us all young and old is churchills admonition never give in never give in never never never never in nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense
3907860 the general perception of winston churchill is of him on the steps of 10 downing street with a cigar in one hand and making a v for victory sign with the other
3907861 i think its important for people to understand that he couldnt have got there if he hadnt had such an extraordinary life in the 50 years before
3907862 i gulped and said yes i would about six years later he contacted me

3907865 para selebriti yang kesengsem pada dunia politik sebetulnya tak semata mengejar jabatan publik yang memikat mereka justru terbukanya akses ke peluang peluang lain di luar politik seandainya mereka terpilih misalnya akses ke peluang peluang ekonomi jadi lebih besar selain itu mungkin ada status sosial tersendiri jika artis jadi pejabat

3907872 cameronism displays a number of key features it emphasises the pragmatic over the theoretical takes an essentially optimistic view of human nature favours the devolution rather than centralisation of power stresses social rather than economic progress and places more faith in society than in the state
3907873 but cameronism diverges most sharply from thatcherism with its focus on social rather than economic matters
3907874 ok dave that sounds great nobody can sensibly argue against a more socially responsible civilised society
3907875 labour would love to be able to cut the law and order budget following an outbreak of humean humanity but how given that you mostly correctly suggest that the state cant do it are you going to lead us to this brave responsible world
3907876 even before becoming pm he is making a compelling argument for his own powerlessness at the head of government real power lies in society
3907877 if elected cameron will be first prime minister from britains ruling class for half a century but one who proudly claims not to be able to rule
3907878 cameron verges on hypocrisy on the issue of state action
3907879 he has set up a young adult trust which he says is working in partnership with many of britains leading youth organisations to develop plans for a national programme for all 16 year olds that helps teach them the responsibilities of adulthood
3907880 a national programme to teach adulthood if ed balls schools secretary announced it the labour is very often guilty of a knee jerk statism but he is equally at risk of an unthinking anti statism
3907881 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3907882 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3907883 there might be people who are disgruntled and these things can grow arms and legs
3907884 thats been no different for the time that ive been in football paul knows within himself that he cant let it worry him i see no evidence of anything thats hurtful in terms of his relationship with the players or anything like that
3907885 ive always felt you cant get too close to players
3907886 maybe you can get closer than the manager can at times youve got to keep your distance
3907887 ive seen her shes not even an overhead kick from the goal line
3907888 i just dont believe in that its got to be bad cop bad cop
3907889 a real mans man when he shook your hand you had to untangle your mangled fingers afterwards call that a handshake hed say as he crushed your hand into his
3907890 players like imaginative bright sessions and in archies they always saw an immediate value in them there was a relationship with what would be happening on saturday
3907891 its not the same when you think the bloke next to you has an eye on the managers chair
3907892 the one thing these guys have to be reassured about is that the older figure isnt after your job
3907893 with younger managers you maybe want to say something different to what they are saying but they are the manager
3907894 it can be said quietly after a meeting or after a game
3907895 if we lose the first five games of the season then yes there can be questions but that hasnt happened
3907896 weve just got to get on with it and make sure we are ready for the start of the season
3907897 at bolton sammy was familiar with the place but everybody coming in here is new even the promoted managers probably have more experience than paul hull citys phil brown has experience at bolton so he knows the scene tony pulis at stoke hasnt been at this level but hes an experienced manager tony mowbray has a load of experience in scotland and at west brom paul is the new kid on the block
3907898 thats when well find out a wee bit more about each other
3907899 maybe i would have done something maybe he would have wanted to do something totally different you judge on when the occasion arises youve got to try and keep a cool head and make sure we come to an agreement
3907900 he was a young player coming into a team with a lot of experienced players back then so it was a big ask for someone
3907901 it took him a while to settle down it wasnt just a case of coming in and fitting in straight away he had to battle to overcome quite a few things like how could he replace remi moses or norman whiteside but he buckled down hes a strong willed character paul he knows what he wants and he wont deviate from that if he sets his mind out to do something he will stick to that and see it through thats always served him well
3907902 unfortunately due to the fact that more than 24 hours have elapsed since he disappeared the police and coastguard have decided that there is nothing further that can be done at this stage
3907903 following the dive his father was first to surface and it appears that the boy was seen to surface soon after he was described by family as being seen slightly tilted backwards as though his jacket was inflated and was buoyant in no apparent signs of distress
3907904 having surfaced there appears to have been a problem trying to start the small boat and the father subsequently called for help from a passing charter boat who came to assist it is at this point that all parties lost sight of the boy
3907905 i was taking customers on a diving trip when i saw the small craft and a man waving his arms
3907906 i have endured that stigma for 15 years its fair to say it has ruined my life yet until now i have never received the slightest apology from the authorities for my ordeal i admit i got a bit emotional it means so much to me
3907907 a lot of wild figures had been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people to realise they got it wrong i thought the establishment would just make a token payment but this is like winning the lottery what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
3907908 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the last 16 years
3907909 it will allow him to try and rebuild his life and to have some sort of normal existence but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that that is something he will never get
3907910 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
3907911 to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
3907912 the state party should ensure that its powers to protect information genuinely related to matters of national security are narrowly utilised and limited to instances where the release of such information would be harmful to national security
3907913 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indir ectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts
3907914 its application does not lead to a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression
3907915 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
3907916 some writers even sent him their own work while others spoke of their own circumstances and how they felt much better for writing to byron many of them were furtive and embarrassed and said can you burn this letter as soon as you have read it
3907917 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters
3907918 why did my breast with rapture glow thy talents to admire why as i read my bosom felt enthusiastic fire
3907919 should curiosity prompt you and should you not be afraid of gratifying it by trusting yourself alone in the green park at seven oclock this evening you will see echo
3907920 if this evening proves inconvenient the same chance shall wait you tomorrow evening at the same hour
3907921 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
3907922 the fact that byron kept the letters is important he was absolutely fascinated by his own reception and the way he was perceived he even mingled his poetry with his own self creation he pretended not to care about his reader while at the same time making huge efforts to keep track of what his readers thought about him
3907923 my lord tho i have not the honor of being personally known to you i yet venture to address you tho i cannot offer any other excuse for the liberty i take if the irresistible desire i feel of thus unknown paying my humble tribute at the shrine of genius be not deemd any apology i have hung in rapt attention over every line of child harold i am not a critic but an inexperienced young woman but the language of genius amp of nature must be felt amp never makes its appeal in vain to my heart
3907924 my lord you cannot retire to any part of the civilized globe where you will not be followed by the echoes of the worlds applause you must be satiated with the sound of public praise but you may yet endure it in the still small voice of a retired and nameless individual who has admired your splendid abilities from their very dawn
3907925 turn not from this address because the writer is anonymous
3907926 the person who addresses you is a stranger to yourself she never has had and probably never will have even the honor of an acquaintance though a female i have studied your works with attention and think i observed the tragedy of your mind
3907927 it isnt exact thats one we talked about it has to be exact
3907928 to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth
3907929 it seems that the fates have conspired against us but i am now even more determined to go again next year we always said every mile we sailed would be an achievement and we have to try and take positives from this years efforts i have enjoyed the wonderful experience of night sailing and the tranquility and sense of freedom that brings
3907930 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3907931 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3907932 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3907933 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3907934 fadel shanas death is a tragedy a journalist in action was killed by idf israel defence force fire along with others not involved in the hostilities however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3907935 the idfs decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
3907936 the fpa believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present
3907937 turns out the kindle is becoming the ipod of the book world
3907938 i dont think the kindle is quite the ipod moment for newspapers but even so it is pretty cute
3907939 no editor wants to be like a generation of music industry executives who woke up one morning to find the ipod had eaten their business
3907940 takes a look at the guardian and its possible positioning within a 10 year time frame
3907941 they have a tremendous amount of money already and for them to ask for more for some of the things theyre asking for it doesnt seem like people are ready to pay for that now
3907942 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3907943 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
3907944 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply he will be much missed
3907945 johns courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
3907946 same kinds of projects that have pushed californias water system to the brink
3907947 enforcing land use regulations based on true water availability creating a statewide conservation program protecting watershed and aquatic ecosystems and creating water policy that focuses on sustainability and equity
3907948 this is why i never read the newspaper or go on cnn anymore
3907949 they love to discriminate against us and make us feel bad it just makes me stronger and more proud of my culture and heritage
3907950 i dont know why white people are like that and have problems with us what did we do to them i dont understand it but i guess it makes them feel better about themselves to make fun of other races

3907992 in federal court affidavits mr ngs lawyers contend that when he complained of severe pain that did not respond to analgesics and grew too weak to walk or even stand to call his family from a detention pay phone officials accused him of faking his condition they denied him a wheelchair and refused pleas for an independent medical evaluation
3907993 on aug 1 mr ng was taken to a hospital where doctors found he had terminal cancer and a fractured spine he died five days later
3907994 even when she was sleeping she had a smile on her face
3907995 whatever that can give our family the memories from her we would like to have
3907996 we know we cannot repair any emotional wounds at this point
3907997 all i know is i love john more than anything i have never loved someone more than him it is incredible what i feel for him yet it is frightening going into the unknown another concept i feel has evolved into something amazing as marriage i use to be terrified by the idea but no longer am i i truly believe i found my mate for eternity and what follows i am finally ready to make the step to life commitment
3907998 you look at the dvd and ask yourself is that acceptable behavior by your police
3907999 these two officers were in a fight for their lives
3908000 thats what made it more degrading and sensationalized outside of the mace and being beat
3908001 he continued to resist he struck the officer with his fist then the suspect produced a gun and that changed the entire face of the encounter
3908002 yet if you dont have identification and you are walking around smith homes youre going to the guilty county jail cell
3908003 and if folks want to do that thats okay with us
3908004 i am disappointed however that we only saw a portion of what happened
3908005 and our officers are trained to use any reasonable maneuver to bring such a situation under control and prevent the loss of life
3908006 appears on the pages where it should most pages and does not where the template says it should be truncated currently data and sandbox subpages

3908008 anteriormente se ve a un espacio penitenciario concebido en arena cemento y dispositivos de seguridad hoy por hoy nuestra visi n humanista del sistema penitenciario busca que estos espacios sean de organizaci n social de los internos con trabajo productivo que tengan empleo y una fuente de ingresos producto de su trabajo una vez que salgan del sistema penitenciario
3908009 eso un espacio que nos da a nosotros la posibilidad de medir la habilidad las destrezas de nuestros internos a trav s de actividades como festivales de teatro m sica las olimpiadas penitenciarias como un elemento bien importante la incorporaci n de la familia a trav s de comit s en el proceso de comercializaci n del trabajo penitenciario

3908013 la cobarde agresi n de miembros de la uni n juvenil cruce ista y dirigentes c vicos contra colaboradores cubanos en san ignacio de velasco

3908016 for years we always thought it would be great to have our own beer
3908017 people like them because they re big only sold in the 22 ounce size
3908018 people love the labels and then people are surprised to find out that the beer s really good the financial arrangement included a signing bonus and some future residuals mr gratt said but has brought nonprofits for the nonprofit so far still he added we hope it ll be a nice little chunk of change as we go forward
3908019 to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws
3908020 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
3908021 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
3908022 lay the foundations for a new phase of brotherly relations
3908023 a neighbor saw the girls standing there just kind of hanging around like they were waiting for somebody and a few minutes later a small car pulled up and the twins got in the back seat
3908024 and then they drove away and we havent heard from them since
3908025 they look up close like theyre 22 and mentally theyre 10 or 11 theyre very slow mentally they each have dolls and they still play with them and yet their interest is to meet boys
3908026 mr corrodi indicated that the girls had run away from home in the past but had always returned that same day
3908027 these run away instances were never reported to law enforcement
3908028 i dont know if someone is holding them because i think theyd be home if they could get home
3908029 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3908030 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3908031 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3908032 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3908033 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3908034 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3908035 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3908036 they realized we were on the right track and they wanted our information we had to go to the sin for meetings with the intelligence community along with then police chief marco miyashiro
3908037 there are understandably differences between our countries but the overarching theme is the friendship that was established between my father and kim il sung my prayer is that this relationship will grow even stronger and i pledge to do everything i can to make this happen

3908045 josh has charisma hes intelligent and hes personable with his teammates along with our coaching staff
3908046 i have all of the confidence in the world with him
3908047 he breaks down every aspect of a quarterbacks game into little sections that build on top of each other im trying to learn as much as i can from him on the field and in the classroom
3908048 we were vulnerable last year as far as defensive line depth prince said
3908049 weve been multiple on defense here playing three man and four man fronts weve got more depth at outside linebacker too
3908050 its sort of a hybrid a guy who can play outside linebacker or defensive end were getting more dynamic speed on the field in this conference with the offenses we face thats a good thing
3908051 theyre not speculative theyve proven they can get up and go to class theyve proven they can play against good players theyve proven they can live away from home and wash their own clothes and theyre winners
3908052 if you dont have any standards or rules no ones ever going to break any of them i cant say im happy about disciplining any kid about stuff that doesnt have to do with football
3908053 but when youre in a public position and you represent as many people as we represent you have an obligation to try and obey the law to comply with whatever it is
3908054 im excited because i really think we have the big 12 experience where it counts thats at quarterback and on the offensive line
3908055 it drew us closer together but all of us had rather it not have happened defensive end ian campbell told espn
3908056 just to go up there and see what everybody was going through taught us something

3908059 our relations with the alliance cannot but change after jaap de hoop scheffer the nato chief did not say a word about the victims of the attack
3908060 whats different about immigration today as opposed to a century ago is not the immigrants but us america is now a mature society and that renders our past experience with immigration irrelevant we have a post industrial knowledge based economy a welfare state advanced communications and transportation technology that complicate the issues of security and sovereignty etc we have in other words outgrown mass immigration it was an important phase of our national development and played an important part in shaping who we are as a nation but like other phases weve passed through as a people pioneers settling the frontier for instance its something we need to put behind us
3908061 startup or hunker down what s happening with tech startup
3908062 its the best kept secret for getting started because vcs and the organised angel groups are really looking for traction before they commit but angel investors will invest in people first
3908063 one thing we did that was extremely helpful and ill pass it out to anyone whos starting a company and that is go out and do a convertible note as the very first thing to do because what that does is that gives you some time on the clock gets some people on board without giving any equity and that gave us a lot of confidence when we went out and done the fundraising and stuff and on top of that it gave us a lot of great contacts
3908064 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3908065 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3908066 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3908067 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3908068 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3908069 i was told twigs and leaves could fall out onto the operatives and cause serious injuries
3908070 we make every effort to collect bins in all sorts of circumstances we have a very satisfactory and comprehensive refuse service
3908071 i am quite satisfied we are doing the best we can to facilitate the best collection of rubbish we can in west wiltshire
3908072 we now have an agreement between the resident and refuse collectors over where he can put his bin in future
3908073 we wanted to cheer her up and there arent many things you can give to someone who is ill
3908074 i thought it was taking away something very important from someone who wasnt very well if i was on a ward id like to receive cards
3908075 we had never heard of this before and can only assume it is due to any bugs in the flowers or vases being knocked over
3908076 we asked if they could be left in a dayroom or nurses quarters but this was also rejected and they wouldnt dispose of them so the alternative was to bin them or bring them home
3908077 sounded pretty good guys i think the bass needs to come down though
3908078 i would never go back on my word unless there was something in it for me
3908079 we dont care who gets the bailout we just like to give away borrowed money hey nancy they want more ok 800 billion
3908080 every time they hear the noise of a car they think it is a russian plane
3908081 they were the ones that started this but the georgians were also at fault they mined the road before we could get out the whole village left in a convoy and three or four cars exploded innocent georgians were killed by georgian mines
3908082 until last week we always had the hope of returning one day
3908083 as a ruin it is certainly the most important memorial for reconciliation in berlin and possibly in germany
3908084 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3908085 pending an international mechanism russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures
3908086 in all truthfulness what really matters is whether more students are becoming ready for college and career
3908087 thats why we think its time to change the focus of our dialogue and we ought to be focused on are we making significant inroads in preparing more students to become ready for college course work
3908088 at the same time we need to see it as an opportunity to make changes in the system and how we serve those students
3908089 we know we still need to work on that achievement gap
3908090 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption
3908091 were still pretty early stages in this location stuff but if we can get wide adoption of fire eagle across the web we can become a leader
3908092 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3908093 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3908094 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3908095 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3908096 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3908097 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3908098 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3908099 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3908100 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3908101 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3908102 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3908103 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3908104 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3908113 one of dragics american representatives rade filipovich joined his representative in spain quique villalobos a week ago to begin working out a deal complicating matters is that dragics rights were technically owned by union olimpija in his hometown of ljubljana and he was on loan to tau dragic had to work out a buyout figure that would satisfy both teams

3908117 how the failed policies of the last eight years have betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
3908118 youve got conservative whites here and i think there are some whites who are probably not ready to vote for an african american candidate
3908119 i believe looking at the returns in my election that had lynn swann 2006 republican gubernatorial candidate been the identical candidate that he was well spoken charismatic good looking but white instead of black instead of winning by 22 points i would have won by 17 or so

3908208 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3908209 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3908210 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation

3908250 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks the credit suisse subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the structured credit groups holdings of exotic products opaque valuations and high leverage the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence

3908260 i respect and have learned a lot from the european tradition
3908261 when young people see orchestras just sitting down and doing concerts each week they see something routine they cant understand what people enjoy about it
3908262 in venezuela going to a symphony concert is like going to a pop concert everyone feels very proud it is our symbol we have our flag our national anthem and now our orchestras the citizens feel part of it
3908263 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3908264 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more houses to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3908265 our customers have to invest in assets right through the cycle so we are not exposed to the doom and gloom you are seeing elsewhere
3908266 we are not seeing the uk or us governments backing off on projects in health education or transport we would expect strong growth through 2009 and beyond
3908267 but thats how you have to ride a time trial as if you never want to breathe again
3908268 the slowdown in demand coupled with the increase in businesses non wage costs is likely to put downward pressure on employment growth
3908269 this is the weakest set of labour market data since the economic slowdown began employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions of the country while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3908270 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs we have been warning for months about a downturn in the economy and i fear there are more job losses to come particularly in food manufacturing where thousands of workers are being made redundant
3908271 until now low unemployment has helped sustain the belief that there might be a soft landing in the housing market without large scale repossessions but it is now clear that a prolonged slowdown is going to reproduce many of the bad conditions of the early 1990s
3908272 one consequence of the recent fall in the oil price has been a rapid unwinding of what the survey has highlighted as a highly crowded trade investors have reduced long or overweight positions in energy and started closing underweight positions in financials but have they lost sight of the fundamentals
3908273 the banks are looking no better than fair value at current share prices they are about 80 through the write down of toxic assets such as sub prime loans so far they have taken a 140bn 70bn hit but theres probably a further 40bn to come
3908274 on re capitalisations they have so far raised 120bn in fresh equity but european banks need another 70 120bn uk banks most likely to need to raise capital are barclays and hbos

3908283 the real economic data is undeniable the economy is slowing really sharply and to forecast inflation below target in two years time was a huge signal
3908284 will they cut rates next month well you cant rule it out with the signal they have sent
3908285 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
3908286 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
3908287 more pronounced slowdown in activity is likely to be necessary to contain wage and price pressures and ensure inflation expectations are anchored in the medium term
3908288 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times but the fundamentals of the uk economy remain strong the government stands behind the 2 inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target
3908289 it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating
3908290 after the inflation report what were seeing is the realisation from real money managers that theres no potential for a rate hike and that its brought forward the possibility for a rate cut leading to sterling weakness

3908292 what stands out is the mediocrity of a group of technicians and developers who are well meaning but full of an anachronistic paternalism in the best of cases and are once more using gaud to leave their personal mark on the building to the detriment of the original work
3908293 what they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of gaud it has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes
3908294 this was a disaster because even though they had all the necessary documents regarding the material and techniques to be used they were not followed
3908295 the problem with restoring gaud s work is that by the time there was an awareness of his legacy he had been dead for 50 years

3908303 the shares have rallied 86 since june 7 in part on hopes that dsg could ease its financial situation through asset sales we believe these hopes are misplaced unlike kingfisher in italy dsgs spanish and italian operations are leasehold and loss making

3908307 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3908308 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3908309 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation

3908313 theres been considerable levelling down to make a levels more accessible to a much broader range of abilities and to serve a much bigger higher education system
3908314 the essay questions tell you the factors you should consider instead of allowing you to decide what the important factors are there is strong evidence that its now easier to get an a but it wont feel like that to the students who are under more pressure than their parents ever knew
3908315 from the point of view of pupils the exams are harder because they are more competitive its not enough to get a pass or a c you need an a or three as to get into the top university
3908316 i would say modern kids are better prepared for the exams i would expect them to score more highly as a result
3908317 certainly they are on dodgy ground with the code of admissions but this undoubtedly happens in the top state schools that want to get the best results
3908318 if the stretch and challenge in the questions does what they are meant to no amount of drilling will help less able students it may be the a could help identify the best students regardless of their educational background
3908319 i regret that it now appears that the chinese authorities have announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time i understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
3908320 all the data predicts that the trend will continue and the a grade will go up by about one percentage point
3908321 fewer applicants have missed their offers that implies results have gone up the impression is were seeing fewer bs than last year so the number of as will have gone up a bit theres a general sense of it being tougher than ever with a slightly lower rate of students turning down offers as well
3908322 it will give us no room for manoeuvre for people who have missed their results because of illness or family issues or other discretionary issues
3908323 we could be up for record numbers of student who get three as who are turned down on that measure yes its tougher on the students
3908324 extended projects are an excellent way to learn skills and even better when a range of research and presentation methods can be used but trying to graft them on to an already crowded and incompatible curriculum is not the answer
3908325 people will be shocked to see there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
3908326 people are getting better at the exams game the government sets up a system and schools and colleges try to play that system thats what they do thats what independent schools have always been particularly good at
3908327 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
3908328 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place many world records are being broken at the olympics but that doesnt make the feat easier or the distances shorter
3908329 children who do poorly at school are more likely to have been affected by the food they ate many years earlier rather than the chicken nuggets they had at lunchtime

3908353 of washington state workers who have benefited directly from affirmative action 60 percent are white women

3908358 males were 3 4 times more likely than females to be murdered in 2002
3908359 feminists are understandably reluctant to acknowledge that study after study have shown that women are not only as potentially violent as men but they are potentially more violent partly because they expect not to be punished for their actions
3908360 women report using violence in their relationships more often than men the research disputes a long held belief about the nature of domestic violence that if a woman hits its only in response to her partners attacks

3908459 certainly not every abortion leads to domestic violence nor is every case of domestic violence rooted in the trauma of a prior abortion but it is not a coincidence that the rates of abortion and domestic violence have risen together during the last twenty five years the evidence supporting a correlation between abortion and violence between women and men at least for some couples is so compelling that it is beyond dispute
3908460 perhaps the two key elements related to post abortion violence are 1 increased levels of irritability anger and rage and 2 increased tendencies toward risk taking self destructive and suicidal behaviors
3908461 self hatred hatred of the male and hatred of men in general were all significantly correlated to each other
3908462 this constellation of problems an increased tendency toward violence emotional detachment and self destructive behaviors would appear to be exasperated by the study groups dramatically increased rate of drug and alcohol abuse subsequent to abortion

3908491 i do believe that the misconduct of the members amounts to a breach of privilege i do believe that the power of parliament to punish under privilege could be stretched to include the power of expulsion
3908492 i strongly contest the position that for misconduct outside the rules of privilege a member of a legislative body should be expelled from the house
3908493 i doubt if any house of parliament is empowered to cut short a constitutionally prescribed term of its members other than for breach of privilege
3908494 as per the constitution of india nobody the president prime minister chief minister speaker judges nor a journalist has special rights which makes him superior to a citizen of india under special critical circumstances constitutional functionaries are empowered with special privileges only to safeguard the democratic set up to safe guard the unity amp integrity of the nation but not to make themselves superior amp to subjugate his fellow citizens into slavery

3908509 we have definitely improved from a year ago in terms of experience and depth
3908510 its a powerful group of players with a lot of personality both lauren and kara have proven they have what it takes to succeed at this level im excited to see what sydney brings to the group she is really one of the best young forwards in the country with great speed and technical ability i think larsen is also going to be a really strong contributor to the group
3908511 i think we are going to be looking at different players in different positions in terms of defense
3908512 this is probably the first season in quite some time where our goalkeeping is not predetermined its really up for grabs with ashleys experience in the spring and yianas tremendous youth experience i think the two of them will be battling it out for the starting job its going to be interesting but im confident in both of their abilities and would feel comfortable with either as our starting keeper add our transfer marissa campbell to the mix and we have a solid unit heading into the season

3908541 if he wrote it he could get rid of it he had gotten rid of many things by writing them
3908542 i was trying to write then and i found the greatest difficulty aside from knowing truly what you really felt rather than what you were supposed to feel and had been taught to feel was to put down what really happened in action what the actual things were which produced the emotion that you experienced the real thing the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or with luck and if you stated it purely enough always
3908543 the writers only responsibility is to his art he will be completely ruthless if he is a good one he has a dream it anguishes him so much he must get rid of it he has no peace until then
3908544 really the writer doesnt want success he knows he has a short span of life that the day will come when he passes through the wall of oblivion and he wants to leave a scratch on that wall that somebody a hundred or a thousand years later will see
3908545 one writes of scars healed a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin but there is no such thing in the life of an individual there are open wounds shrunk sometimes to the size of a pinprick but wounds still the marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger or the sight of an eye we may not miss them either for one minute in a year but if we should there is nothing to be done about it
3908546 all good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath
3908547 the good writers touch life often the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies
3908548 you must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you
3908549 i would hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo and if an echo sounded no matter how faintly i would send other words to tell to march to fight to create a sense of hunger for life that gnaws in us all
3908550 how vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live
3908551 a perfectly healthy sentence it is true is extremely rare for the most part we miss the hue and fragrance of the thought as if we could be satisfied with the dews of the morning or evening without their colors or the heavens without their azure
3908552 when once the itch of literature comes over a man nothing can cure it but the scratching of a pen but if you have not a pen i suppose you must scratch any way you can
3908553 words so innocent and powerless as they are as standing in a dictionary how potent for good and evil they become in the hands of one who knows how to combine them
3908554 if i dont write to empty my mind i go mad
3908555 writers are not just people who sit down and write they hazard themselves every time you compose your composition of yourself is at stake
3908556 words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean little audible links they are chaining together great inaudible feelings and purposes
3908557 writing is utter solitude the descent into the cold abyss of oneself
3908558 being an author is having angels whisper in your ear and devils too
3908559 the writer writes in order to teach himself to understand himself to satisfy himself the publishing of his ideas though it brings gratification is a curious anticlimax
3908560 youre so smart why dont you just accept things the way they are and youll do fine

3908566 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies

3908592 i think the point here is that the plea agreement laid out robert moultries intentions and whatever they were they seem to be misdirected because the mississippi land water and timber resource board was overseeing the project
3908593 theres nothing in the plea agreement that shows musgroves involvement in this in any way
3908594 i think the whole question is how does everything function
3908595 in todays day and age things have to be run professionally and unfortunately thats not how things are done

3908597 i sincerely hope this win will change the face of olympic sport in india
3908598 in our country olympic sports are not really a priority i hope now they will get more attention
3908599 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3908600 it is not easy for an indian to win an olympic medal let alone a gold because there is no sporting culture in our country i hope this will make sports a way of life in india
3908601 these employees have been terminated or have been suspended and are in the process of being disciplined under local employment law
3908602 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3908603 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks the credit suisse subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the structured credit groups holdings of exotic products opaque valuations and high leverage the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence
3908604 this incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board it does not represent the high ethical standards of credit suisse we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review
3908605 one consequence of the recent fall in the oil price has been a rapid unwinding of what the survey has highlighted as a highly crowded trade investors have reduced long or overweight positions in energy and started closing underweight positions in financials but have they lost sight of the fundamentals
3908606 the banks are looking no better than fair value at current share prices they are about 80 through the write down of toxic assets such as sub prime loans so far they have taken a 140bn 70bn hit but theres probably a further 40bn to come
3908607 on re capitalisations they have so far raised 120bn in fresh equity but european banks need another 70 120bn uk banks most likely to need to raise capital are barclays and hbos
3908608 our customers have to invest in assets right through the cycle so we are not exposed to the doom and gloom you are seeing elsewhere
3908609 we are not seeing the uk or us governments backing off on projects in health education or transport we would expect strong growth through 2009 and beyond
3908610 its a bit like the slice of ham in a vertical ham sandwich
3908611 we leave the white bread and take out the ham from the middle its sort of a thin sliver running through the rock here in a tonne of rock you will probably produce enough gold to make a normal style wedding band
3908612 weve a number of occurrences that we know about at the moment and our exploration effort will be devoted to developing those and see whether those could be economic
3908613 this isnt a wilderness type of park its a managed landscape
3908614 gold isnt something you find every day we recognise the uniqueness of this so were certainly looking at it in as positive a way as we can
3908615 the slowdown in demand coupled with the increase in businesses non wage costs is likely to put downward pressure on employment growth
3908616 this is the weakest set of labour market data since the economic slowdown began employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions of the country while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3908617 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs we have been warning for months about a downturn in the economy and i fear there are more job losses to come particularly in food manufacturing where thousands of workers are being made redundant
3908618 until now low unemployment has helped sustain the belief that there might be a soft landing in the housing market without large scale repossessions but it is now clear that a prolonged slowdown is going to reproduce many of the bad conditions of the early 1990s
3908619 as we continue discussions in respect of a potential transaction we remain clear that the expertise of our people together with our sites makes british energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build
3908620 we have continued to make good progress towards resolving the plant issues that have significantly impacted our performance in the year to date
3908621 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3908622 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more houses to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3908623 the shares have rallied 86 since june 7 in part on hopes that dsg could ease its financial situation through asset sales we believe these hopes are misplaced unlike kingfisher in italy dsgs spanish and italian operations are leasehold and loss making
3908624 the shares look over valued at this level and we think the shorts should hold their nerve
3908625 once 75 has been reached c amp w can de list which would leave the remaining thus shareholders with a stake in an illiquid entity we believe the deal will go through subject to oft review
3908626 while this news is positive it is still some way from a successful resolution as a result our price target remains 200p this represents a 35 discount to net asset value of 306p to reflect the current uncertainties surrounding the two licences

3908635 we expect inflation to reach its maximum in august of 5 4 falling to around 4 3 or 4 4 in the next three months
3908636 the real economic data is undeniable the economy is slowing really sharply and to forecast inflation below target in two years time was a huge signal
3908637 will they cut rates next month well you cant rule it out with the signal they have sent
3908638 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
3908639 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
3908640 more pronounced slowdown in activity is likely to be necessary to contain wage and price pressures and ensure inflation expectations are anchored in the medium term
3908641 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times but the fundamentals of the uk economy remain strong the government stands behind the 2 inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target
3908642 it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating
3908643 after the inflation report what were seeing is the realisation from real money managers that theres no potential for a rate hike and that its brought forward the possibility for a rate cut leading to sterling weakness

3908812 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3908813 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3908814 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3908815 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3908816 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3908817 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species

3908826 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter

3908828 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3908829 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3908830 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3908831 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3908832 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times

3908843 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3908844 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

3908849 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3908850 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3908851 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3908852 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3908853 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3908854 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3908855 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3908864 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3908865 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3908866 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3908867 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat

3908869 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3908870 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3908871 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3908872 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3908873 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3908874 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3908875 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3908876 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3908877 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3908878 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3908879 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3908880 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3908881 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3908882 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3908883 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3908884 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3908885 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3908886 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3908887 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3908888 beste hieronder een leuke citaat misschien iets voor uw web ee
3908889 hallo peter dank voor je reactie ja hoopgevend is die metafoor h amp eg
3908890 beste coert dank je wel voor de metafoor van het vliegwiel ik zat ne
3908891 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
3908892 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
3908893 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3908894 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3908895 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3908896 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3908897 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3908898 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3908899 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3908900 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3908901 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3908902 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3908903 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3908904 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3908905 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3908906 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3908907 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3908908 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3908909 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3908910 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3908911 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3908912 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3908913 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3908914 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3908915 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3908916 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3908917 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3908918 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3908919 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3908920 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3908921 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3908922 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3908923 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3908924 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3908925 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3908926 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3908927 im not a hypocrite i dont see things as right left i see things as right wrong so just because the people at fox like the sean hannitys of the world dont want to accept that theres climate problems theres enough information out there that im concerned
3908928 so al gore says were going to put a set of commercials together where two enemies get together on one cause and say lets support this so theyre going to get donald trump and rosie odonnell to do one and me and my arch enemy to do one
3908929 i gave them two dates because i was doing the movie and i was doing my family vacation and then i had to get the sound track ready for the movie get my album ready the 35 hits do a ford truck commercial and start rehearsing for the tour
3908930 just one of those unfortunate things it could still happen
3908931 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
3908932 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
3908933 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
3908934 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3908935 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3908936 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3908937 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3908938 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3908939 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3908940 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3908941 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3908942 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3908943 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3908944 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3908945 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3908946 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3908947 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3908948 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3908949 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3908950 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3908951 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3908952 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3908953 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3908954 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3908955 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3908956 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3908957 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3908958 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3908959 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3908960 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3908961 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3908962 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3908963 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3908964 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3908965 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3908966 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3908967 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3908968 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3908969 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3908970 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3908971 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3908972 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3908973 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3908974 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
3908975 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
3908976 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
3908977 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
3908978 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
3908979 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
3908980 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
3908981 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
3908982 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
3908983 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3908984 les tout blancs sont trop tristes trop communs trop banals
3908985 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3908986 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3908987 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3908988 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3908989 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3908990 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3908991 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3908992 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3908993 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3908994 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3908995 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3908996 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3908997 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3908998 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3908999 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3909000 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3909001 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3909002 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3909003 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3909004 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3909005 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3909006 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3909007 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3909008 te le vis o dig ita l inte ra tiva
3909009 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3909010 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3909011 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3909012 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3909013 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3909014 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
3909015 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3909016 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3909017 el amor nunca se muere s lo cambia de lugar
3909018 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3909019 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3909020 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3909021 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3909022 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3909023 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3909024 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3909025 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3909026 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3909027 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3909028 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3909029 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3909030 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3909031 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3909032 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3909033 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3909034 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3909035 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3909036 youre always more popular before youre actually in charge of things
3909037 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common
3909038 in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future both views miss the truth that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe
3909039 we will never again make the mistake of not going to the south and proudly delivering our message
3909040 the democratic partys message will no longer be delivered by rush limbaugh and bill oreilly
3909041 it doesnt mean were going to win all those states
3909042 but at least were making it a contest and giving voters something to choose from
3909043 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
3909044 if green party values were now reflected in u s public policy
3909045 would be peace in the middle east based on self determination respect for human rights and justice
3909046 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says by phone from a hotel room in los angeles where he is working on the early stages of an upcoming movie comedy for paramount
3909047 i really didnt want to be one of those guys
3909048 squatting monkeys tell no lies which was shot in santa rosa straddles the manic and reflective
3909049 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with standup again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s
3909050 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it
3909051 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
3909052 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun
3909053 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
3909054 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3909055 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3909056 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3909057 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3909058 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3909059 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3909060 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3909061 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3909062 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3909063 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3909064 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3909065 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3909066 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3909067 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3909068 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3909069 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3909070 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3909071 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3909072 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
3909073 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3909074 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3909075 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
3909076 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3909077 hes a crybaby jon we are so lucky hes not our president
3909078 cause theyre real quiet you can go sneakin up on a mother
3909079 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3909080 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how the vp is going to be evan bayh
3909081 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
3909082 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would

3909093 this book is not intended to be a full or detailed history of animal morphology a complete account is given neither of morphological discoveries nor of morphological theories my aim has been rather to call attention to the existence of diverse typical attitudes to the problems of form and to trace the interplay of the theories that have arisen out of them the main currents of morphological thought are to my mind three the functional or synthetic the formal or transcendental and the materialistic or disintegrative

3909110 one of the best things terrorists could do is just build more fast food restaurants maybe add another pharmaceutical company have a couple more infomercials and encourage people to eat the way they eat now and everybodys gonna be dead in a hundred years they can just walk right in dont have to do a thing one quarter of what you eat keeps you alive and 3 quarters of what you eat keeps your doctor alive weights going up heart disease going up stroke going up were poisoning ourselves with highly processed nutrient depleted foods one of the major problems is what we do to the soil and the air and the water and everything we take in our food we for whatever reason decided were gonna spray everything with every kind of pesticide herbicide larvaecide fungicide we decided were going to genetically modify things we dont know anything about can we actually improve what is already been created and the answer is maybe but not the way weve been doing it if you wanna know whats wrong look down at the table its staring back at you think of it as chronic malnutrition because thats whats going on but if we think were gonna go to the doctor and get a pill for everything weve missed the whole point we have been taught our whole lives to be consumers to modern medicine which is pharmaceutical medicine good health makes a lot of sense but it doesnt make a lot of dollars now the drug industry has every right to make money no question about that at all the ethics i think need to be very closely watched what the pharmaceutical companies are doing may not necessarily be in the interest of our population you can be as sincere and you can be sincerely wrong approximately 106 000 americans die from pharmaceutical drugs each year and these are people who took the medication as directed there is a lot more turning to alternative because what is being done before it doesnt work there is no magic bullet but there is a lifestyle change that reverses serious chronic disease its cheap its simple its safe its effective the solutions are here theyve always been here every single person in the world every culture every language every person in the world knows it you are what you eat food does matter its a choice you dont have to be sick

3909121 children in the u s are facing a growing health crisis due in part to poor nutrition youth who are significantly overweight are at much greater risk for experiencing a variety of serious medical conditions including digestive disorders heart and circulatory illnesses respiratory problems and type 2 diabetes a disease that used to strike only adults they are also more prone to suffer from depression and other mental illnesses an estimated 30 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls born in the united states are at risk for being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at some point in their lives minority youth populations have been disproportionately affected for example african american and mexican american adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 are more likely to be overweight at 21 percent and 23 percent respectively than are non hispanic white children in the same age group 14 percent the institute of medicine has called on all sectors of society industry government health professionals communities schools and families to address this health crisis

3909127 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3909128 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
3909129 longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
3909130 the computer could observe each player and capture a lot of metrics which could be used to change the game so that it becomes personalized for him his game becomes a reflection of who he is internally

3909138 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3909139 saakashvili was mad enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
3909140 the georgians fell into a vulgar trap they thought that russian prime minister vladimir putin would not retaliate in the middle of the olympic games
3909141 they sent in the russian army and liquidated the opposing army
3909142 this is very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp

3909151 as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
3909152 did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house
3909153 how much are you going to sell the puppies for
3909154 no you dont want to buy that little dog if you really want him ill just give him to you
3909155 i dont want you to give him to me that little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and ill pay full price in fact ill give you 2 37 now and 50 cents a month until i have him paid for
3909156 you really dont want to buy this little dog he is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies

3909182 we havent covered this fully before as we didnt think it was worth it but now it seems to be going somewhere so we think we will
3909183 there is a buzz and clearly digital revenues are set to continue to grow
3909184 in terms of money digital is the fastest growing part of ooh but its important to keep it in context digital is still a small slice in terms of inventory
3909185 digital revenues are going to be about 6 of total revenues this year
3909186 in five years time id be gobsmacked if digital contributed more than 15 of out of home revenues
3909187 i dont think they are yet because the medium is relatively new and the offers available to people are very varied
3909188 digital offers the flexibility of a broadcast medium in the high street but many people are shoehorning existing stuff into digital
3909189 contractors need to work out what to sell on a network package basis and what they can sell with additional flexibility wed like the balance of buying a package and buying bespoke wed like to be able to buy outdoor in the way that we buy radio and tv
3909190 some of the bigger contractors arent really helping themselves in terms of presenting outdoor
3909191 if you look at a digital outdoor rate card for two weeks it doesnt encourage planners to exploit it
3909192 for example shoppers outside thomas pink were told they could use their amex card and get a free pair of cufflinks
3909193 were on pretty much all the digital platforms we can be
3909194 but we have no specific metrics to say that it delivered fantastic results
3909195 well be looking at all sorts of different stuff anything that makes the experience a bit richer and we will continue to look at opportunities as they come up
3909196 but for it to work as a premium opportunity the price doesnt necessarily get more expensive because advertisers who bought static sites now share the time so in one way the cost has gone down but its important that digital remains a premium product so it remains in premium locations
3909197 theres no question that it costs a lot of money to post a traditional outdoor campaign every two weeks
3909198 with digital a lot of that cost does go away but the flip side is that these digital signs are a lot more expensive
3909199 it will allow us to put news business news sports news entertainment news and weather up on the screen our research identified that people want to see more than just advertising on digital outdoor and we will allocate 30 seconds of every four minute cycle to content
3909200 i think its naive to think that digital will take over
3909201 our overall digital estate is less than 5 of the total
3909202 digital is a growth area but we dont see it replacing traditional outdoor putting a screen everywhere is not a sensible use of technology it would be visual noise
3909203 were not talking 2012 or anything like that the cost of digital units has to come down
3909204 in five years time when tv viewing becomes more fragmented and more people go on the web digital out of home will be the one place where advertisers can still get people in big groups so outdoor will get stronger and stronger
3909205 historically outdoor doesnt come out well in economic modelling it doesnt compare to radio and tv so in the future if you start buying outdoor on a day part basis it becomes easier to understand sales drive if we see a peak in sales then we can correlate that with outdoor
3909206 there are three critical factors that will drive the success of digital out of home
3909207 the first is the extent to which the technology is going to become affordable the second is the extent to which the creative community gets its head around writing work for the medium the third is the degree to which advertisers continue to embrace digital out of home as the innovative medium it is
3909208 die beerdigung schafft f r die eltern die m glichkeit ihr baby zur letzten ruhest tte zu begleiten und der gedenkstein markiert den ort der trauer und des trostes
3909209 es ist gerade auch in den sp teren trauerphasen und f r die psychische verarbeitung einer solchen trag die sehr hilfreich und wichtig dass die eltern immer wieder an diesen ort zur ckkehren und ihre wenigen erinnerungen an das verlorene baby wachrufen k nnen
3909210 und wenn du dich getr stet hast wirst du froh sein mich gekannt zu haben
3909211 when we start the comprehensive plan process you guys need to be involved as i would encourage every citizen of florence to be involved
3909212 we are not a party in any possible conflict between western countries and our friend the islamic republic of iran
3909213 we hope things will not develop for the worse and that the language of reason and dialogue between all parties prevails
3909214 i am excited at the prospect of joining prudential the company has a rare combination of both a proud heritage and an extremely exciting future the financial performance of the company over the past three years has been strong and differentiated from its competitors by its broad geographic reach particularly its exposure to asia product expertise and the strength of the leadership team built under group chief executive mark tucker sir david clementi has done an outstanding job of steering the company through this significant progress over the past six years
3909215 harveys record of achievement in the international financial services arena is exceptional and his leadership skills are clear i have served six years as chairman of prudential a period of considerable change real internationalisation of the business and rapid development of our management capability and leave the company in strong shape
3909216 vodafone shares have been sold off on weaker european top line growth despite group ebit and fcf guidance being maintained we believe the market has overreacted and though vodafones top line is exposed to the economy profits and fcf are much more defensive
3909217 the overall economic outlook for the group remains uncertain due primarily to the unpredictability of feed commodity prices and demand for fuels in the light of recent record oil prices
3909218 our proposal is a response to the changes our business is facing and the highly competitive nature of the market we operate in we are seeking to secure alternative roles for colleagues based on their experience and the roles available
3909219 if fewer people are moving house then they are less likely to purchase new fridges and washing machines that fit into their new space
3909220 will retain ownership of these highly successful businesses and move to integrating them with our existing franchise in australia and new zealand
3909221 assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risk involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time
3909222 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3909223 the government will end up having to borrow significantly more than expected
3909224 employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3909225 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs
3909226 the economy is losing momentum but with inflation set to rise to 5 per cent or more in the short term there is little room for interest rate cuts in the immediate future
3909227 we have lower output and higher costs but they are both understandable and we have still delivered financial results in excess of predictions
3909228 market conditions have allowed us to run eggborough at a higher margin
3909229 i dont see anything that suggests global energy prices are going to be driven down again dramatically
3909230 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
3909231 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
3909232 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3909233 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3909234 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3909235 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3909236 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3909237 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3909238 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3909239 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3909240 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3909241 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country

3909461 the advice given to americas best gymnasts can be used to help the everyday american the idea that failure is ok and even a good thing is extremely hard to grasp at first and it even seems counter intuitive why would you want to fail and how would that help you succeed when you imagine what it takes to be the best that america has to offer when sending athletes to the olympics the athletes that we see on television doing amazing things and breaking impossible records is only the end product of the journey it took to become so great
3909462 failure should be given the same positive outlook that we give to perfection or success because thats the engine that gets us there too many of us give up because failing feels bad and we just want to fast forward to the perfection and olympic athlete phase of practice yet how can we know how to do something perfect if we dont understand how we failed

3909754 joe what the heck does a director of photography do
3909755 could they only ask questions with a yes or no answer as i am not a writer and cannot type very fast
3909756 to jim what exactly does a director of photography do on atlantis what decisions are you responsible for making which one have you been proudest of and do you regret any choices you have made
3909757 now question for jim menard because hes seriously one of my heroes as im a ltheatrical lighting designer who loves his work what is your preperation process do you experiment draw things out test during whatever time you get or do you just wing it if you plan everything what method do you find easiest
3909758 what inspired the shades of blue for atlantis and the stained glass around the city
3909759 for jim i have noticed the change in background lighting on the show from season 1 2 and 3 being bright to season 4 and 5 being a bit darker did you make that choice and why i like it it is more real life looking dont know if that is the reason you did it or not
3909760 jim i really enjoy it when youre on the audio commentaries its clear you really love the show your colleagues and your work two questions 1 what are the pros and cons of hd filming in terms of lighting 2 how much of your lighting work is aimed at making the actors look their best and does that ever conflict with how you or the director want the sets to be lit
3909761 question for jim mernard what made you want to be a director of photography
3909762 question for mr menard after listening to various commentaries i still cant figure out whos responsible for the look of a show angles light amp shadow colors lenses etc the director the director of photography or the lighting director and then sometimes the commentaries talk up the camera operator too is there a rule as to who does what or is that pretty fluid depending on the individuals involved
3909763 1 when you are shooting a fight scene where the action is rapid paced and the actors are very close to each other as in broken ties do you use one camera on a dolly a hand held camera or multiple cameras to catch the action at various angles
3909764 jim first of all thanks for taking time out to answer questions for us fans my questions to you are what his harder to do lighting indoor sets like the village set that is suppose to simulate outdoors for night or day if it wasnt a problem of time or scheduling would you like to shoot more outdoor night shoots or is the technical problems involved with shooting outdoors at night more of a pain since changing over to hd what do you find the biggest difference you have to make in order to film in hd and what is the biggest challenge of hd
3909765 howd you get your start in commercial television where do you get your inspiration for new or interesting angles lighting etc
3909766 jim who is the easiest star to film who is the most difficult please give examples thanks for your contribution to sga
3909767 is it difficult to work in enclosed spaces i e the atlantis conference room the puddle jumpers the bridge of the daedalus apollo keep up the fantastic work
3909768 i was wondering if you could explain how you create the pulsing blue lighting effect for the gateroom when you do the night lights off scenes its a fantastic rippled water look and i was wondering what the secret was
3909769 how much has the production changed since you began working on stargate sg1s season 2 do you have now more input free reign in your lighting choices
3909770 1 being a dp what do you find is the hardest part of your job the prep work for a shot or shooting the shot itself the hardest part is managing time and knowing where to just get what you need or where to indulge a little 2 any interest in directing an episode i thought you had but as i breifly checked all 14 of my sg dvd cases i dont recall seeing your name if you did could you let me know so i can rewatch it i have not directed here although i used to shoot and direct second units i may give it a shot in the future 3 lastly love when you do the dvd commentaries thanks for the great work
3909771 question for mr menard has there ever been a look or image that seemed really good intially for atlantis that you wish you could
3909772 question for jim menard id just like to say that i really enjoy listening to your commentaries on the dvds and i have alot more appreciation for lighting in the episodes 1 what types of lighting styles are different from sg1 and atlantis for that matter how do you decide how a scene should be lit and 2 are you involved in other projects besides stargate either currently or during the hiatus etc
3909773 for jim menard thank you for your dvd episode commentaries you have a soothing voice and a calm and patient manner in explaining things that makes me enjoy the experience a couple of questions with a limited number of sets especially as regards ships how do you approach giving each one its own distinct look and personality we have to mix it up with layered lighting setups lens choices and camera angles the ships are tough to make different but you can argue that they are all of a certain class and why would they look different midway and daedalus variations show the diversity of the set also how have you had to modify your work processes and execution with the advent of hd lastly dont worry i wont ask you to write a haiku unless you think youre up to the challenge
3909774 for mr menard thank you for participating here its been great hearing from different people behind the scenes on what it takes to put together a show like sga and what the experience is like my questions first what changes in techonlogy have made your job easier hd has made the job both easier and harder as discussed in other questions which have made it harder do you foresee some new technology emerging in the near future that will change how you do your job electronic capture will evolve as memory capabilities grow we currently record to hard drives with a tape backup and will move to pure ram very soon with increased recording latitudes i think you will see more raw data capture with more finishing in post is there a scene show or movie that you wish you could redo after seeing it aired i am usually happy when it leaves my hands but it can get to air a lot different what is your all time favorite scene shot accomplishment during your career the underwater submarine in watergate was shot completely practical although vfx added a little deep background to the final product it was a challenge because the bubble front of the sub showed everything we tried to do that one sticks out in my mind but i have had many good moments exactly how many people do you have operating under you in your department and how much do you personally supervise them vs simply passing on what you want and letting them decide how to accomplish the task sorry for so many questions but as a person with no artistic talents its always fascinating watching those who do have such skills at work
3909775 mr menard is your interest in photography mainly film or do you also take still photography
3909776 do some types of lighting and framing flatter only cetain actors i mean do you ever choose a specific setup for a scene because the actor in it has for example an angular face vs a round face
3909777 what do you find the most satisfying about your job when you get to a scene what do you immediately start looking at can you tell us about any really difficult lighting situations that youve ended up being really happy with the way they turned out
3909778 what do you feel was your most challenging episode to date and why
3909779 hi jim do you have a set template for lighting indoor and outdoor shots and do you use this template all of the time and then just tweak it with additional lighting to capture what your trying to accomplish i have noticed the strong head lighting on interior scenes but do you follow up with softer lighting on the sides for skin tones and then use gels ect for effects on equipement

3909782 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3909783 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
3909784 longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
3909785 the computer could observe each player and capture a lot of metrics which could be used to change the game so that it becomes personalized for him his game becomes a reflection of who he is internally
3909786 computer gaming would be like having your own spielberg and his whole job in life would be to craft a personal entertainment experience just for you
3909787 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3909788 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3909789 washington is out to deny china east land access to either russia the middle east or to the oil and gas fields of the caspian sea
3909790 a close look at the map of eurasia begins to suggest what is so vital for china and therefore for washingtons future domination of eurasia the goal is not only strategic encirclement of russia through a series of nato bases ranging from camp bond steel in kosovo to poland to georgia possibly ukraine and white russia which would enable nato to control energy ties between russia and the european union
3909791 washington policy now encompasses a series of democratic or soft coup projects which would strategically cut china off from access to the vital oil and gas reserves of the caspian including kazakhstan the earlier asian great silk road trade routes went through tashkent in uzbekistan and almaty in kazakhstan for geographically obvious reasons in a region surrounded by major mountain ranges geopolitical control of uzbekistan kyrgyzstan kazakhstan would enable control of any potential pipeline routes between china and central asia just as the encirclement of russia controls pipeline and other ties between it and western europe china india and the mideast
3909792 eurasia is the worlds axial super continent a power that dominated eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the worlds three most economically productive regions western europe and east asia a glance at the map also suggests that a country dominant in eurasia would almost automatically control the middle east and africa with eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard it no longer suffices to fashion one policy for europe and another for asia eurasia accounts for 75 of the worlds population 60 of its gnp and 75 of its energy resources collectively eurasias potential power overshadows even americas
3909793 the real threat that remains almost unmentionable in western establishment circles and therefore in the media
3909794 bright and fierce and fickle is the south and dark and true and tender is the north

3909803 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3909804 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3909805 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3909806 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3909807 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3909808 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3909809 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3909810 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3909811 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3909812 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3909813 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3909814 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3909815 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3909816 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3909817 suplico lhe pelas entranhas de cristo pense na possibilidade de estar errado

3909819 but if i had your faith then i could make it safe and clean if only i was sure that my head on the door was a dream
3909820 ma se avessi la tua fede poi potrei renderla salva e pulita se solo fossi certo che la mia testa sulla porta fosse un sogno
3909821 we started as many jobs by april of 2008 as we had done in all of 2007
3909822 if we stay on track were probably going to grow by about 40 percent this year
3909823 weve got them all the way from texas to the arctic circle
3909824 ground source heat pumps have the lowest life cycle costs in several cost studies that ive done
3909825 for commercial buildings where you have a fairly large heating and cooling load the payback period could be two to three years
3909826 between 2005 and 2007 our revenue increased by 200 percent
3909827 the suppliers are backlogged and a few of the companies are six to eight weeks out from being able to send us everything last year the high density polyethylene pipe we use was really hard to come by
3909828 right now we dont have enough installers and we dont have enough drillers
3909829 ive got drillers who are booked out for six months
3909830 were bringing in folks who arent necessarily career hvac guys
3909831 even folks who have no skills are interested in learning because its such a growth industry
3909832 this is not the kind of town that will take this
3909833 our proposal is a response to the changes our business is facing and the highly competitive nature of the market we operate in we are seeking to secure alternative roles for colleagues based on their experience and the roles available
3909834 if fewer people are moving house then they are less likely to purchase new fridges and washing machines that fit into their new space
3909835 we have lower output and higher costs but they are both understandable and we have still delivered financial results in excess of predictions
3909836 market conditions have allowed us to run eggborough at a higher margin
3909837 i dont see anything that suggests global energy prices are going to be driven down again dramatically
3909838 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
3909839 will retain ownership of these highly successful businesses and move to integrating them with our existing franchise in australia and new zealand
3909840 assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risk involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time
3909841 i am excited at the prospect of joining prudential the company has a rare combination of both a proud heritage and an extremely exciting future the financial performance of the company over the past three years has been strong and differentiated from its competitors by its broad geographic reach particularly its exposure to asia product expertise and the strength of the leadership team built under group chief executive mark tucker sir david clementi has done an outstanding job of steering the company through this significant progress over the past six years
3909842 harveys record of achievement in the international financial services arena is exceptional and his leadership skills are clear i have served six years as chairman of prudential a period of considerable change real internationalisation of the business and rapid development of our management capability and leave the company in strong shape
3909843 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3909844 vodafone shares have been sold off on weaker european top line growth despite group ebit and fcf guidance being maintained we believe the market has overreacted and though vodafones top line is exposed to the economy profits and fcf are much more defensive
3909845 the overall economic outlook for the group remains uncertain due primarily to the unpredictability of feed commodity prices and demand for fuels in the light of recent record oil prices
3909846 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers
3909847 i condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms and urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators
3909848 every time they hear the noise of a car they think it is a russian plane
3909849 they were the ones that started this but the georgians were also at fault they mined the road before we could get out the whole village left in a convoy and three or four cars exploded innocent georgians were killed by georgian mines
3909850 until last week we always had the hope of returning one day
3909851 the divorce occurred two months ago and it was all very amicable and non confrontational
3909852 fiona is a very good friend and a great lawyer so thats why i decided to go with her
3909853 and if he is foolish enough to do so he should be prepared to get completely clobbered by the courts if it goes wrong
3909854 we are planning a fourth series next year but there has been no decision where well be filming
3909855 were sworn to secrecy until the queen makes an announcement
3909856 we saw him on telly recently and he looked very brown
3909857 i only mention it as its not exactly been roasting down here
3909858 they shot dead vachtang he was my neighbour there were four of them in a yellow private car they stopped at the village and started insulting vachtang and killed him afterwards they took some things from his house and just drove away
3909859 he was shot in the back he was just trying to get away and they killed him for nothing we have now lost everything we can never go back to our homes as long as those men are there
3909860 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3909861 i know there are a lot of people injured in the villages but what can i do i have responsibility towards my staff as well
3909862 we tried to find and talk to georgian officials in gori but couldnt find any
3909863 i do not know about that but i am sure if people have committed crimes they will be punished
3909864 im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century of course we have to deal with russia and deal with putin but it has to be on a very realistic basis
3909865 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g8 so they should be excluded
3909866 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3909867 of course peace in the caucasus is in the interest of everyone but it is simply common sense to recognise that russia is rooted in the region by common geography and centuries of history
3909868 russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region
3909869 russias actions are illegal but the us anduk who launched an equally illegal and much more devastating invasion of iraq are ill placed to be outraged a de facto russian annexation of south ossetia must not be permitted unless we eventually want a war for east ukraine
3909870 nato is part of the cause of the problem not the solution by encircling and humiliating russia nato has created the climate in russia so favourable to putin
3909871 a repeat of the failed extremism that has characterised and plagued democratic presidential politics since the late 1960s
3909872 the only political party i ever consciously joined is the constitution party
3909873 i am writing this book strictly to examine and oppose barack obama
3909874 as a ruin it is certainly the most important memorial for reconciliation in berlin and possibly in germany
3909875 they have only collapsed in the sense that there wont be a deal before mbeki leaves as originally planned
3909876 they have only collapsed in the sense that the deadline for a deal has not been met but they have not collapsed forever because there is still room for more dialogue and a consensus can still be reached if mugabe reconsiders his stance the ball is in his court there is no way we can budge on this fundamental issue configuration of powers
3909877 he insinuated threats against us and said we had to continue doing what we were doing
3909878 i know for a fact that he was an informant during the time that he was dealing with us
3909879 his argument would basically be that gonzales threatened him as a government agent in order to induce him to plant the sniffer
3909880 he would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat and his sentence was based on that
3909881 is it possible the same thing that happened to estonia is happening to georgia to put it quite simply the answer is yes
3909882 lots of icmp traffic and russian hosts sounds a lot more like users firing off the ping command and a lot less like some evil government controlled botnet
3909883 venturebeat city would photograph every vehicle entering manhattan and sniff out radioactivity nytimes
3909884 when our skin is touched our bodies produce various responses including producing oxytocin the emotional bonding hormone this makes us feel good around our loved one
3909885 that heart warming feeling means that we want more of their company
3909886 many women dont want to be seen as too small or too big and buy a bra that doesnt fit well in order to be what they consider to be a normal size
3909887 to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
3909888 the state party should ensure that its powers to protect information genuinely related to matters of national security are narrowly utilised and limited to instances where the release of such information would be harmful to national security
3909889 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indir ectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts
3909890 its application does not lead to a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression
3909891 i was travelling too much i was gone too much
3909892 i paid off a poker debt with sexual favours and i fell in love
3909893 so you wound up with apollo if hes sometimes hard to swallow use this
3909894 why fool around with hamburger when you have steak at home
3909895 over night we totally changed i think one day we had just nothing in common
3909896 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him wearing sunglasses
3909897 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3909898 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
3909899 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply he will be much missed
3909900 johns courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
3909901 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am am i going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3909902 amazing like christmas like your birthday or like winning the lottery
3909903 people may have been concerned that i wouldnt have the funds to bring in players but thats not the case we are actively pursuing players as we speak
3909904 it has been a difficult week in many respects but it has happened very early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better
3909905 there have been misunderstandings but its also true to say that in any organisation if you make big changes on occasions messages will be misinterpreted and mistakes will be made
3909906 i had a meeting with the players to make the group aware that im in charge and will make the decisions that affect the players
3909907 if players leave or if they go that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everybody understands now that that is the situation i think we will be better for it and we can now move forward
3909908 we cant really go into the details of the owners position because if we are truthful we dont know which way it is going to go
3909909 but i was aware of this situation before i came here
3909910 i was struggling not so much with the heat but i didnt prepare for the matches as well as i should have done after all the flying and stuff
3909911 it was unprofessional and disappointing on my part and again something i need to learn from and make sure it doesnt happen again because i think im playing really well right now
3909912 we have not played much together and thats something in the future we will look to do before we play in the big tournaments
3909913 after being a part of the olympics for the first time and seeing what it means when the athletes win medals and how big a deal it is you realise how much you want to do well and sometimes you want it a bit too much and dont play so well
3909914 we were a medal prospect but we are very very very disappointed
3909915 its been a great few days but thats a big slap in the face but we have to try and turn it around now we are absolutely gutted were disappointed for everyone at home who supported us its not a nice position to be in after thinking we were going to go in for a medal tomorrow
3909916 i think we will go and have a bit of a tear let it all out have a swim down and we have some people who need our support tomorrow
3909917 its very satisfying to see the players willingness to stay the club will not do anything crazy or break our financial and sporting guidelines so we have gone as far as we have been able to
3909918 it would have been an honour to fight de la hoya
3909919 i find the offer unacceptable and the only option is to move on
3909920 assistant referees are not getting properly rewarded for the arduous and difficult job they do
3909921 their remuneration lags well behind that of assistant referees elsewhere in europe
3909922 even if the claim was met in full we would be talking about rewards that are considerably lower than many other parts of europe when were talking about the premier league being the richest league in the world
3909923 we have had cases where select group assistants have been on the line in the freezing cold and are soaking wet and while the referee is getting into a new clean dry shirt at half time the assistant is shivering because they will provide them with only one of each of the three coloured shirts the pgmo are saying we are negotiating so you can get the shirts at cost basically theyre having to pay for their own kit
3909924 officials fees are a matter for the pgmo not the premier league
3909925 desde aquele dia em que entornei caf nas cal as e tu foste a nica pessoa no escrit rio que n o riu
3909926 sim sou para sempre mas agora tenho de ir desculpa mas hoje n o te vou levar comigo
3909927 no i mean if it was your birthday what would you want for dinner
3909928 mommy you arent doing anything tomorrow its your birthday and i am going to make you a birthday dinner
3909929 while dealing with a stranger common courtesy you use but the family you love you seem to abuse go and look on the kitchen floor youll find some flowers there by the door those are the flowers he brought for you he picked them himself pink yellow and blue he stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes
3909930 i found em out by the tree i picked em because theyre pretty like you i knew youd like em especially the blue
3909931 son i am very sorry for the way i acted today i shouldnt have yelled at you that way
3909932 son i love you too i like the flowers especially the blue
3909933 that would be most young rugby league peoples dream and im no different
3909934 i grew up as a kid watching the greats like ellery hanley andy gregory mike gregory and shaun edwards playing out in australia im not boasting that im going to be picked but this might be the best chance im going to get its a big incentive for me and a few of the other guys at quins for the rest of the season
3909935 weve just said to ourselves as a group that its still in our hands and if we win our games which we think were good enough to do we can still make it
3909936 but its going to be a massive challenge to do that against saints warrington dominated them last week and they still won to have any chance well have to play as strong and fast as they do and put our bodies in positions where they probably shouldnt be put
3909937 ive got no doubts that hes exactly the sort of bloke theyre going to need out in australia
3909938 this isnt bias its the way the blokes who have played with him think about him too
3909939 jimmy dymock a world cup winner with australia in 1995 who played for the broncos with purdham always used to say that people missed the point with this bloke and didnt realise how good he is
3909940 i remember the brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett saying when he was asked about scott prince during this years state of origin series that he wouldnt be silly enough not to pick him thats the way i feel about purdo
3909941 you are what you are and i think with the challenges theyre going to be facing out there the fact that rob comes from a different point of view will be helpful to the group
3909942 most of the work i did was on my dads farm in gosforth a little place not far from sellafield
3909943 then me and my brother had a little farm between us with a few cows and sheep i was happy enough doing that and playing for whitehaven when the broncos as they were then came in for me and i signed for them in december 2001 id never been to london at that stage and i still didnt for a bit because we went on a training camp out in australia for six weeks i came back to london from there and that was it ive been here ever since im getting married at the end of the year and i call it my home now its like 2 4 children except weve got dogs
3909944 i really admire him for giving up what he knew up north and taking the chance
3909945 but i think he made us have as much of a cumbrian outlook as we turned him into a londoner hes been great for the club as well as the team
3909946 why does it matter i know im going to succeed
3909947 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing its hard to criticise them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here but if they dont they will be kicking themselves
3909948 youd think the captain should be involved in something like that wouldnt you
3909949 you have to look at the ref 17 unawarded penalties thats bullshit
3909950 you cannot do anything about matters outside your control and match officials fall into that category
3909951 wayne has decided not to talk to the media and i support that
3909952 matt has proved himself with australia a and the act brumbies who have one of the best back lines in world rugby
3909953 why does it matter i know im going to succeed

3909961 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
3909962 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
3909963 russia has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that might have related to south ossetia
3909964 that calls into question russias suitability for all kinds of activities that it has said it wants to be a part of
3909965 you know you guys are about to be put in permanent timeout if you dont shape up and ship out
3909966 you can keep your meter with you and test your blood sugar wherever you want
3909967 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3909968 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3909969 we cannot end these traditions just because there is no king
3909970 i said exploitation and discrimination has been going on this should be eliminated
3909971 we dont want to end the tradition but we have to change for the protection of the culture
3909972 our relations with the alliance cannot but change after jaap de hoop scheffer the nato chief did not say a word about the victims of the attack
3909973 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3909974 querido comandante dichosos nos sentimos un d a como hoy de tenerlo entre nosotros de amar a quien nos contin a orientando con firmeza y justicia
3909975 usted es el director del equipo el jonronero mayor y el gladiador invencible de esta inmensa obra en la que ha actuado como excepcional estratega impulsor y profeta desde sus inicios
3909976 desde una prisi n del imperio con cari o y j bilo le digo felicidades
3909977 i havent heard both sides of the story and i think it would be prudent to get as much information as possible
3909978 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3909979 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3909980 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3909981 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3909982 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3909983 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3909984 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3909985 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3909986 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3909987 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3909988 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3909989 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3909990 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3909991 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3909992 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3909993 las autoridades continuar n con la investigaci n para esclarecer si se estaba violando la ley no es la primera vez que se detectan buceadores junto a las ballenas
3909994 est prohibida toda actividad de acercamiento persecuci n navegaci n nataci n y buceo a cualquier especie de mam fero marino y sus cr as en las costas y mar de jurisdicci n provincial durante todo el a o
3909995 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3909996 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3909997 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3909998 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3909999 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
