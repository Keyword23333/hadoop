6270002 i applied for and got a job in a supermarket as a deli clerk

6270012 our this song has recently been claimed by our old buddy omar nadeem as his own composition and he released an unplugged snip of it on internet

6270016 the more personal a mode of contact the more effective it is
6270017 and once they have those numbers they can use them again for mobilization
6270018 a lot of people simply dont use text messaging yet
6270019 and a lot of the people that do use it are reluctant to sign up to receive mass text updates
6270020 it should be used judiciously only send something out if you actually have something important to say
6270021 politics always strives to be about a one on one conversation
6270022 were betting that these subscribers are young folks who havent been reached out to before
6270023 for those who have been anxiously awaiting mccains pick as a signal of his ideological intentions

6270027 it may take ten years for car manufacturers to create and redesign higher fuel efficient cars fifteen years to find and exploit fuel fossil reserves in the us and maybe twenty more years to develop safe nuclear energy providing 50 of our electricity
6270028 moment o meter was developed and tested during the last three years and we now manufacture it in clearwater florida
6270029 it all started with my daughter and im always looking for a good reason to spend some time in my workshop
6270030 every driver can take advantage of their cars momentum to drastically increase their fuel efficiency if they are shown how
6270031 you will save 20 to 50 gas the very first time you use it to make it work for everyone it had to be simple and visual moment o meter is very simple just react to the devices lights to save gas i personally save 50 but my wife saves only 32 it still depends on the drivers skills but improvement is expected as driving efficiently will become second nature
6270032 when tom presented me his work i was skeptical because it was utterly simple and logical thus not new it took thousands of years to put wheels on our luggage because nobody thought about it
6270033 all im seeing is my gun r brok hao i feex
6270034 he looks forward every year to buying a new car
6270035 when i am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit i put a glass of vodka next to the water glass if i start to get nervous i take a sip

6270038 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6270039 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6270040 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6270041 all im seeing is my gun r brok hao i feex
6270042 increase intensity and the number of colours that can be displayed and is easier to view in natural light
6270043 increase intensity and the number of colours that can be displayed and is easier to view in natural light
6270044 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6270045 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6270046 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6270047 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6270048 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6270049 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6270050 hes doing it and making it look so simple did it and it didnt look that easy
6270051 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do
6270052 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6270053 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6270054 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that
6270055 its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6270056 its his anatomy hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart
6270057 and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see people enjoying themselves having a good time and he recognized the responsibility of seizing the moment and he did it
6270058 i told myself if im going to get this record its going to be here because the track is really fast
6270059 i told myself im going to go out there and give it my all and i went out there and just left everything on the track
6270060 i just want to chill out i just want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6270061 a prototype from her paris hilton push up bra line
6270062 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6270063 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6270064 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6270065 myc means new friends amp romance and no fear of rejection in public
6270066 my contact number or myc web site is a new social utility to connect users with people around through unique contact numbers c and e mail personal profiles and c apparel accessories
6270067 myc means new friends amp romance and no fear of rejection in public

6270073 increase intensity and the number of colours that can be displayed and is easier to view in natural light
6270074 you know judge felts broke the law and could have hurt or killed someone he has to pay the consequences just like everyone else if you are correct and this is his first offense then he deserves fair treatment he probably is a good father servant husband etc as you stated now tell me how you feel about matt kelty you are probably part of the good old boy network that wants to see matt lose everything do you think he and his family which includes his 4 children deserve to suffer more than they already have if so how can you feel sorry for felts but not for kelty matt kelty did not break any laws and was exhonorated by the ac election board the appropriate administrative body the grand jury indictment and the subsequent criminal charges are part of a conspiracy and not a theory being an attorney you should know the term collateral estoppel the perjury charges are shams and the special prosecutors line of questioning was vague at best and misleading matt told the truth and therefore cannot be guilty of perjury watch the public access broadcast of matt kelty the story behind the story airing tonight at 9 00 p m on verizon channel 27 the next time it airs is the 22nd 9 00 p m on verizon 25 you tell me how you feel about the kelty matter you jump on the bandwagon on his behalf and i will jump on the bandwagon on behalf of judge felts
6270075 besides according to popp once the media got a hold of the story they wouldnt give kelty a break
6270076 both of the major papers they dont want someone who is that conservative who believes in limited government and pro family issues
6270077 kelty said we used to be considered the city of churches and now were considered the city of strip clubs i dont think the more liberal newspapers wanted someone that strong that conservative that pro family with that kind of integrity
6270078 isto em ess ncia o que satan diz para deus
6270079 how can we get some big corporation to move here from somewhere else
6270080 we dont really know how to create an industry ourselves but we can locate some industry thats already created and promise them that they can do the same thing at a lower cost here usually because its a sufficiently mature industry that it doesnt need a lot of specialized support which we cant offer them in any case
6270081 cheap workers that wont cause any trouble because theyre grateful for anything they can get
6270082 cheap government that will starve public services that dont directly benefit the business
6270083 when you hear the descriptions of what the rescue workers found when they got to the scene of the stricken aircraft it seems almost incredible that anyone survived a fireball such as this
6270084 the focus of the investigation will now be on what exactly happened to that plane in the last few seconds as it reached the end of the runway
6270085 the plane was totally broken apart it was all full of bodies
6270086 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6270087 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6270088 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6270089 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6270090 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6270091 the reason i asked the divas to be in my video was because i didnt want the typical casting for this
6270092 i wanted women who mean something the divas have a fan base of their own theyre all stars each in their own way they all mean something
6270093 the houses they were sad because no people were inside them
6270094 might see me as a deluded literati seeking poetry where there were only brutal denunciations of crimes against humanity that he would think that i was a simple stylist who wasnt paying any attention to the content of the report
6270095 if the people who run the sport want it taken to a wider audience and to keep their foothold in the sponsorship market they do need to broaden their appeal
6270096 the days when show jumpers were household names are gone and with the best will in the world that cache no longer exists
6270097 but now you cannot see the riders faces under their helmets and they become indistinguishable so there has been a lot of discussion about people wearing jackets with their names on so that followers can identify them
6270098 unless we identify the competitors how are people going to get to know the riders
6270099 i dont see anything wrong with a little sex and glamour if thats what it takes to bring more interest to the sport
6270100 i can jump a double clear round and no one else does but i dont even get a medal
6270101 for such a long time we have not been able to go out there and make some money or get something back
6270102 look at golf and tennis and how far they have come i dont think we need to have women going half naked to get more money for the sport but there does need to be change
6270103 no i dont want every american to have healthcare unless they can pay for it without any government assistance
6270104 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6270105 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown
6270106 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6270107 obviously we have a lot to work on but overall it was good i thought john did a good job of getting the ball in the endzone
6270108 those are some good players but once we get everybody out on the field thats healthy things will be a lot different
6270109 hes been here for three days and has had two practices and a scrimmage he stepped up and really did a good job on pass protections that was the biggest concern i had with him i thought he did a really good job for three days of practice
6270110 el avi n levant el morro y las ruedas delanteras y traseras pero eso se est investigando
6270111 tanto exigir responsabilidades como poner los medios para que este tipo de accidentes no vuelvan a suceder
6270112 el comandante es el que decide si vuela o no lo valora y si se supone que el avi n debe ser revisado vuelve
6270113 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6270114 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6270115 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6270116 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6270117 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6270118 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6270119 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6270120 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6270121 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6270122 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6270123 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6270124 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6270125 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6270126 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6270127 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6270128 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6270129 laughter is the best tension reliever and sex is second so if youre having funny sex youre probably in good shape
6270130 certain volcanic formations in the state of colorado are of unusual scientific interest as illustrating erratic erosion and it appears that the public interest would be promoted by preserving said formations as a national monument
6270131 its not something you can drive into creede and ask at the chamber of commerce visitor center what can i do today
6270132 other places have secured appropriations to build highways over more dificult places which highways cost a greater amount of money or required much more time than it will to build the scenic road which means so much to our city
6270133 the steepness of that route is evidenced by the personal opinions of each rider who refuses to discuss the subject politely
6270134 the national park service regards the area as interesting but not of such unique or great value to warrant retention in the national park system
6270135 it reminds me of being at the beach with the sand castles
6270136 although the area is a spectacular bit of our states national attractions and highly deserving of wide recognition and use neither of the governmental agencies have made it easily accessible
6270137 i think it is nice the way it is we didnt see any beer bottles or anything
6270138 its worth the work to get here and if you want to see it you have to work to see it
6270139 i think we would want to keep it low key we dont want to discourage people from going there because its part of the national forest
6270140 but we just want to make sure it doesnt get loved to death
6270141 ninety four per cent are in favour of their new eba australian licensed aircraft engineers association secretary steve purvinas said today
6270142 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6270143 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6270144 as previously advised the group 2008 npat is not expected to be above the 2007 group npat of 643 million it said
6270145 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6270146 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6270147 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6270148 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6270149 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6270150 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6270151 an in depth inquiry to avoid such accidents in the future said ms alvarez
6270152 los que se dedican al tr fico de drogas tienen sus horas contadas
6270153 i say ready and she runs upstairs and peeks around the corner and i am downstairs and i throw the ball up the stairs and down the hall
6270154 she gets it and brings it to the top of the stairs and drops it if it does not reach the floor downstairs she will bat it around until it does we do that until she is tired and lays down
6270155 one of us will hide usually aggie and then i will find her
6270156 she always comes to the window so she knows im on my way in
6270157 i walk she rides in her backpack around my complex and up to the senior center
6270158 but her most favorite thing to do is play tether ball shell even play by herself she likes to smack the ball with her snout as she jumps in the air
6270159 i dangle it in the air above them and in front of them and on the floor and shadow and harley just go crazy
6270160 its their favorite thing to do and its something they can do together
6270161 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6270162 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6270163 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6270164 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6270165 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6270166 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6270167 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6270168 our aim is to receive international guarantees of ukraines territorial integrity which is only guarantee possible in the framework of collective security
6270169 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6270170 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6270171 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6270172 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic
6270173 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6270174 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6270175 a lot of buyers didnt really believe there was a threat
6270176 your entitled to your own opinion but your not entitled to your own facts
6270177 global governance as though any day now our country will be colonized by bangladeshis who will force us to marry gay hungarians
6270178 since its launch in 1992 the moscow times has been the one indispensable daily newspaper for the english speaking community in the russian capital with its excellent independent reporting of current affairs and outstanding business coverage it makes topical issues both accessible and absorbing the idea of starting the working day without the moscow times would be unthinkable congratulations to the board and staff on fifteen years of achievement and keep up the good work
6270179 it is clear to us and the u s leadership does not deny this that the anti missile defense in europe will broadened and modernized in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6270180 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6270181 we do not have the means to blow up such a bridge
6270182 time will show it depends on how the political process develops
6270183 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal
6270184 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increased and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6270185 laura and i are saddened by the death of chairwoman stephanie tubbs jones
6270186 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to healthcare
6270187 after making history as the first african american woman elected to congress from ohio the congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all americans
6270188 i have to thank chad mccumbee and terry labonte for their efforts in the no 45 wells fargo dodge over the last several races they have moved the team up to the 39 th position in the owner points standings and were in position to move up a few more if we can keep improving i know it hasnt been easy on the crew all three of us have different driving styles so they havent been able to get into much of a rhythm its just a testament to how hard this team works
6270189 this car can still be considered new at some tracks we just ran it for the first time at indy a few weeks ago when we go to bristol though its just a racecar this will be the fourth race for this car here everyone has it figured out by now it does a great job on the short tracks like bristol where you tend to use the bump and run to pass the way the bumpers on these cars line up you can still nudge someone to make the pass but they dont spin out as often
6270190 nascar did their homework and came up with some great adjustments to the schedule for 2009 atlanta will pack their stands for labor day because labor day weekend is an event in the south having a restrictor plate race in the chase was already a wild card in determining our champion but putting talladega at the first of november could potentially cause a big shakeup in the points with only a few races to go that will be very interesting and iowa gets a nationwide race ive said all along that the nationwide series needs to be able to stand alone going to iowa will help them do that
6270191 the university of nevada police department requested that we investigate lane grow and his vehicle registration
6270192 we were told he had purchased a new pickup truck in september but had registered it in idaho
6270193 the day off would probably do me good right now but im still going to have a crack at it hopefully the adrenalin will kick in tomorrow and i wont be able to feel it
6270194 tomorrow ill warm up see how it feels and do an assessment after that the main thing is going to be doing a gate i use so much of my upper body to pull at the start thatll be the main concern i dont want to go out there and just race the race i want to be able to compete compete to win
6270195 these guys they know how to handle stuff like this
6270196 its common when these rain delays happen in the summer its obviously a good thing for kyle mikey obviously wanted to get the race going but at the same time he could probably use a little bit of rest and relaxation
6270197 it just happened so quick he came in on the inside super hot going way too fast and i knew there was no way he was going to stick but i had nowhere to go
6270198 i put more of my weight on the left arm and my shoulder was out for a good minute or two i took a deep breath it went back into socket and it was a million times better
6270199 in a persons life they choose to take certain roads the road they choose will either be for fullfilment or for happiness just because a person is not on the same road as you does not mean they are lost
6270200 i will cherish that for the rest of my life
6270201 lord you know i am not ready to serve you
6270202 thank you for obeying god and your name is written in the lambs book of life
6270203 well brother steven jesus did say pick up your cross daily and follow him
6270204 come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
6270205 the meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism
6270206 were not there yet but this is another significant step
6270207 we were complaining last year that it wasnt hard enough now were finding ourselves in a situation that it might be too hard
6270208 theyve put some big stones in the wooded section its a beautiful course a hard course
6270209 globalization and technology and automation all weaken the position of workers
6270210 sticks and stones may break my bones but names can never hurt me
6270211 800 do not belong in the same question im sorry
6270212 wildlife photography usually needs as much focal length as you can bring along or afford
6270213 la serie constaba de mini cap tulos de pocos minutos en dos temporadas que fueron compilados en dos dvds m s adelante en mi opini n esta serie fue excelente destacando el trabajo realizado por tartakovsky en el dise o de personajes naves ambientes etc

6270216 the promotion is well deserved and will enable him to do even more to improve the business the way we service our fans the impact we can have on amateur hockey on
6270217 i know chris well enough that he will stop at nothing less in making the islanders the model franchise in the nhl

6270224 bahwa ayah mereka syeikh abdul wahab merasa sangat kagum atas kecerdasan muhammad padahal ia masih di bawah umur
6270225 wahai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong allah nescaya allah akan menolongmu dan menetapkan pendirianmu
6270226 silakan tidak ada seorang pun yang boleh menghalang rancangan yang mulia ini
6270227 apabila amir uthman tetap membiarkan dan mengizinkan syeikh muhammad terus berdakwah dan bertempat tinggal di wilayahnya serta tidak mau membunuh syeikh muhammad maka semua pajak dan upeti wilayah badui yang selama ini dibayar kepada amir uthman akan diputuskan ketika itu wilayah badwi tunduk dibawah kekuasaan pemerintahan uyainah
6270228 wahai amir sebenarnya apa yang aku sampaikan dari dakwahku tidak lain adalah dinullah agama allah dalam rangka melaksanakan kandungan la ilaha illallah tiada tuhan melainkan allah muhammad rasulullah maka barangsiapa berpegang teguh pada agama dan membantu pengembangannya dengan ikhlas dan yakin pasti allah akan mengulurkan bantuan dan pertolongannya kepada orang itu dan allah akan membantunya untuk dapat menguasai negeri negeri musuhnya saya berharap kepada anda amir supaya bersabar dan tetap berpegang terhadap pegangan kita bersama terlebih dahulu untuk sama sama berjuang demi tegaknya kembali dinullah di negeri ini mohon sekali lagi amir menerima ajakan ini mudah mudahan allah akan memberi pertolongan kepada anda dan menjaga anda dari ancaman badui itu begitu juga dengan musuh musuh anda yang lainnya dan allah akan memberi kekuatan kepada anda untuk melawan mereka agar anda dapat mengambil alih daerah badui untuk sepenuhnya menjadi daerah uyainah di bawah kekuasaan anda
6270229 demi menghindari pertumpahan darah dan karena tidak ada lagi pilihan lain di samping beberapa pertimbangan lainnya maka terpaksalah syeikh meninggalkan negeri uyainah menuju negeri dariyah dengan menempuh perjalanan secara berjalan kaki seorang diri tanpa ditemani oleh seorangpun beliau meninggalkan negeri uyainah pada waktu dinihari dan sampai ke negeri dariyah pada waktu malam hari
6270230 bergembiralah kakanda dengan keuntungan besar ini keuntungan di mana allah telah mengirimkan ke negeri kita seorang ulama juru dakwah yang mengajak masyarakat kita kepada agama allah berpegang teguh kepada kitabullah dan sunnah rasulnya inilah suatu keuntungan yang sangat besar kanda jangan ragu ragu untuk menerima dan membantu perjuangan ulama ini mari sekarang juga kakanda menjemputnya kemari
6270231 ya syeikh bergembiralah anda di negeri kami kami menerima dan menyambut kedatangan anda di negeri ini dengan penuh gembira dan kami berikrar untuk menjamin keselamatan dan keamanan anda syeikh di negeri ini dalam menyampaikan dakwahnya kepada masyarakat dariyah demi kejayaan dakwah islamiyah yang anda syeikh rencanakan kami dan seluruh keluarga besar ibnu saud akan mempertaruhkan nyawa dan harta untuk bersama sama anda syeikh berjuang demi meninggikan agama allah dan menghidupkan sunnah rasulnya sehingga allah memenangkan perjuangan ini insya allah
6270232 alhamdulillah anda juga patut gembira dan insya allah negeri ini akan diberkati allah swt kami ingin mengajak umat ini kepada agama allah siapa yang menolong agama ini allah akan menolongnya dan siapa yang mendukung agama ini nescaya allah akan mendukungnya dan insya allah kita akan melihat kenyataan ini dalam waktu yang tidak begitu lama
6270233 sebenarnya tuduhan tersebut telah dijawab sendiri oleh syeikh ibnu abdul wahab sendiri dalam suatu risalah yang ditulisnya dan dialamatkan kepada abdullah bin suhaim dalam pelbagai masalah yang diperselisihkan itu diantaranya beliau menulis bahwa semua itu adalah bohong dan kata kata dusta belaka seperti dia dituduh membatalkan kitab kitab mazhab dan dia mendakwakan dirinya sebagai mujtahid bukan muqallid
6270234 aqidah dan agama yang aku anut ialah mazhab ahli sunnah wal jamaah sebagai tuntunan yang dipegang oleh para imam muslimin seperti imam imam mazhab empat dan pengikut pengikutnya sampai hari kiamat aku hanyalah suka menjelaskan kepada orang orang tentang pemurnian agama dan aku larang mereka berdoa mohon syafaat pada orang yang hidup atau orang mati daripada orang orang soleh dan lainnya
6270235 bahwa mazhab kami dalam ushuluddin tauhid adalah mazhab ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dan cara sistem pemahaman kami adalah mengikuti cara ulama salaf sedangkan dalam hal masalah furu fiqh kami cenderung mengikuti mazhab ahmad bin hanbal rahimahullah kami tidak pernah mengingkari melarang seseorang bermazhab dengan salah satu daripada mazhab yang empat dan kami tidak mempersetujui seseorang bermazhab kepada mazhab yang luar dari mazhab empat seprti mazhab rafidhah zaidiyah imamiyah dan lain lain lagi kami tidak membenarkan mereka mengikuti mazhab mazhab yang batil malah kami memaksa mereka supaya bertaqlid ikut kepada salah satu dari mazhab empat tersebut kami tidak pernah sama sekali mengaku bahwa kami sudah sampai ke tingkat mujtahid mutlaq juga tidak seorang pun di antara para pengikut kami yang berani mendakwakan dirinya dengan demikian hanya ada beberapa masalah yang kalau kami lihat di sana ada nash yang jelas baik dari quran mahupun sunnah dan setelah kami periksa dengan teliti tidak ada yang menasakhkannya atau yang mentaskhsiskannya atau yang menentangnya lebih kuat daripadanya serta dipegangi pula oleh salah seorang imam empat maka kami mengambilnya dan kami meninggalkan mazhab yang kami anut seperti dalam masalah warisan yang menyangkut dengan kakek dan saudara lelaki dalam hal ini kami berpendirian mendahulukan kakek meskipun menyalahi mazhab kami hambali
6270236 adapun yang mereka fitnah kepada kami sudah tentu dengan maksud untuk menutup nutupi dan menghalang halangi yang hak dan mereka membohongi orang banyak dengan berkata bahwa kami suka mentafsirkan quran dengan selera kami tanpa mengindahkan kitab kitab tafsirnya
6270237 dan apapun yang kami yakini terhadap martabat muhammad saw bahwa martabat beliau itu adalah setinggi tinggi martabat makhluk secara mutlak dan beliau itu hidup di dalam kuburnya dalam keadaan yang lebih daripada kehidupan para syuhada yang telah digariskan dalam al quran karena beliau itu lebih utama dari mereka dengan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa rasulullah saw mendengar salam orang yang mengucapkan kepadanya dan adalah sunnah berziarah kepada kuburnya kecuali jika semata mata dari jauh hanya datang untuk berziarah ke maqamnya namun sunat juga berziarah ke masjid nabi dan melakukan solat di dalamnya kemudian berziarah ke maqamnya dan barangsiapa yang menggunakan waktunya yang berharga untuk membaca selawat ke atas nabi selawat yang datang daripada beliau sendiri maka ia akan mendapat kebahagiaan di dunia dan akhirat
6270238 sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul rasul kami dengan membawa bukti bukti yang nyata dan telah kami turunkan bersama mereka al kitab dan mizan neraca keadilan supaya manusia dapat melaksanakan keadilan dan kami ciptakan besi yang padanya terdapat kekuatan yang hebat dan pelbagai manfaat bagi umat manusia dan supaya allah mengetahui siapa yang menolong agama nya dan rasulnya padahal allah tidak dilihatnya sesungguhnya allah maha kuat dan maha perkasa
6270239 there remains the concern that the us experience might presage steep housing downturns in other countries that have also experienced a rapid rise in house prices with associated risks for output growth
6270240 we have been expecting a slowdown in monthly lending levels in line with interest rate rises
6270241 in the coming months we expect to see monthly lending levels dip below their 2006 levels for the first time this year as rate effects are exacerbated by the recent liquidity problems in the mortgage market
6270242 there is no doubt that in american terms obama is a liberal democrat just as theres no doubt that harpers base is on the conservative right on this issue ssm and others the u s left is on the canadian right
6270243 its not good to kite in scary conditions the most important thing about kite surfing is safety if its gusting or there are squalls nobody should be out
6270244 if the tide is out it doesnt bother you much but if not it doesnt take it long to flood give it a couple minutes and if its raining hard youre in the water
6270245 we have boards we put up around the doors and we seal it up with liquid nails and it keeps the water from coming in
6270246 is producing historic flooding across a large portion of brevard county
6270247 fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast florida as the storm turns westward on august 21
6270248 this general motion is expected tonight with a gradual turn to the northwest and west northwest on thursday
6270249 on this track fay is forecast to move very slowly across northern florida on thursday
6270250 the storm continues to be a threat to this community
6270251 no significant change in strength is anticipated before fay moves over land
6270252 they sent a warning to everyone not to leave their homes because the snakes are coming out of their holes and theres fish everywhere
6270253 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6270254 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6270255 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6270256 no deployment of ballistic missile defense systems in their neighborhoods at least not without their cooperation
6270257 the russian attitude is when we had a good reputation we were pushed around by the west so maybe an edgy reputation in the russian view isnt such a bad thing
6270258 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6270259 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6270260 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6270261 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6270262 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6270263 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6270264 annual house price inflation in london was 17 4 in august down from 19 1 in july
6270265 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6270266 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6270267 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6270268 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6270269 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6270270 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6270271 simon whitfield demonstrated the true spirit of olympic competition and proved that he is a world class athlete
6270272 congratulations simon that was one of the best showing of heart and sheer determination ive ever seen

6270274 39 ways musicians bands and record labels can reduce expenses and prosper in todays economic times
6270275 strategic along with all participants in the property finance sector has been affected by loan defaults and there are likely to be further loan defaults due to the continuing slowdown in the new zealand economy and in particular the property development sector
6270276 the time is right for this the people of northern ireland want it eight out of 10 people in the recent life and times survey highlighted that they would like to live in mixed areas
6270277 we have been instructed by a large number of people who want to take a civil action for damages following the loss of information relating to them by police at castlereagh
6270278 it just doesnt seem fair that other families are housed over us when we are homeless for so long i understand that everyone wants to be rehoused but no one seems to care that we have been waiting for so long and they are getting homes before us
6270279 with regard to re housing families from the new lodge multi storey
6270280 all we want is for somewhere to call our own so that caola will have a proper home its horrible knowing that she will have to come out of hospital with no permanent home to go to
6270281 i cant understand if i have so many points i am still sitting with nowhere to go im distraught by it all
6270282 how quickly someone is allocated a home from the social housing waiting list depends on a number of factors
6270283 these include their level of points area of choice and type of
6270284 laura has requested that her areas of choice are carlisle new lodge
6270285 i dont know what to make of the last 30 years anymore some of the things that i thought were black and white were a lot more complex
6270286 certainly the narrative that weve heard that we had two warring tribes with some kind of peacemaker in the middle is nonsense
6270287 were running a guy on the republican side that makes haddock look like a choir boy
6270288 when you are reporting in a divided society to a divided society you are very easily labeled
6270289 the more information that emerges the more confused i become
6270290 i dont know how this started out but i know how it ended up and the biggest missing piece is the role of the state
6270291 there is an attempt to keep the lid on rather than take the lid off and its going to be one hell of a battle
6270292 we are opposed to these proposals as they remove services from some of the most socially deprived areas in belfast
6270293 proposals will close libraries in ardoyne in north belfast and
6270294 many people do not know about the closures because no public consultation has been conducted by the belb
6270295 we have recently announced interim funding arrangements for work with victims and survivors during this year
6270296 the outline strategy proposes the way ahead in the longer term
6270297 we hope that this document will help to move us on the road to making a real difference to the lives of those who have been most affected by the events here over the last 40 years
6270298 it is important that everyone with an interest in victims and
6270299 this outline strategy will set a clear direction for policy in this
6270300 a major correction in the market seems unlikely while economic growth is above trend and employment conditions remain buoyant
6270301 the combination of rising interest rates the introduction of home information packs hips and volatility in the financial markets resulting in tightening of lending criteria has certainly affected the confidence of buyers and sellers
6270302 a group of twin cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 republican national convention in st paul
6270303 weve been painted in that bad light being compared to terrorist attacks on the xcel energy center or chemical weapons or other forms of violence that we are criticized for
6270304 its important for people to know we are not as scary as people make us out to be
6270305 our tactics are not terroristic if anything i would call them empowering
6270306 all that means is you are going to stay in an intersection or a place and not leave when the police ask them to leave
6270307 essentially anything that will stop or slow down traffic in this case the traffic of the delegates could be considered a blockade
6270308 engage in nonviolent civil disobedience peacefully preventing the delegates access the xcel center
6270309 its not part of it but we do know there are people who follow the philosophy that some property supports violence and enables violence to happen
6270310 there really is an open debate about it we are just glad this debate can happen and that people can be a part of that debate
6270311 we dont want to say that we condone property violence or that we support it but we also dont want to say we are against it as well
6270312 anarchism is easily the most understood pol theory in america today so much so that newspapers use the silly phrase self described anarchists
6270313 the media says direct action is synonymous with violence that anarchism is the philosophy with the end goal of chaos and disorder
6270314 i think the key issue is people taking control of their own lives rather than offering up their compliance by being satisfied by giving someone else control of it
6270315 a lot of people out there who dont know what an anarchist is might be an anarchist themselves if they look into it a bit its more about creating an environment and community where cooperation is essentially what keeps a community running not coercion
6270316 its very community based knowing who your neighbors are anarchy doesnt mean chaos in the streets breaking windows all these misconceptions a lot of what we do is community based everyone on an equal level with one another
6270317 it isnt about creating something big but making things smaller making communities smaller revolution should be the byproduct
6270318 its essentially a huge dog and pony show sponsored by some of the worst corporations you could think of where lobbyists pay for access to high level politicians
6270319 direct action has been a part of just about any effective political movement throughout history
6270320 we dont think the political elite will stop if we ask nicely
6270321 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
6270322 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
6270323 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6270324 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
6270325 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
6270326 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
6270327 the idea is to encourage the sort of short term selfish
6270328 those responsible for these attacks have no regard for local people
6270329 it is extremely worrying that viable firebombs have been uncovered during the security operations
6270330 these had the potential to cause serious damage to property and injury to people
6270331 i would urge all local businesses to be vigilant at this time and
6270332 while it is not yet known what group or individual may have been
6270333 two of these devices were left at the front window sill and the
6270334 this woman is well known and respected in the area and this degree
6270335 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda
6270336 se ores ha quedado demostrado que tenemos defectos pero el carpintero trabaja con nuestras cualidades eso es lo que nos hace valiosos as que no pensemos ya en nuestros puntos malos y concentr monos en la utilidad de nuestros puntos buenos
6270337 gm said it would begin offering a 12 month 12 000 mile
6270338 it means that pierce county approves of the work she has done
6270339 i am still very sad for dropping out of the race and disappointing everyone
6270340 as i have won more and more championships and more and more people have paid attention to me and supported me i have faced more and more pressure and disruptions to my life i cant have happy get togethers with my friends like other people my age and i feel the expectation from the entire country at every moment i know that yesterday everyone was enthusiastically expecting my appearance and i wanted to cross the finish line like ive done so many times before but it really was because of my foot please believe me that the sadness and pain that i feel is no less than yours
6270341 he was carrying the weight of 1 3 billion people
6270342 its hard to clear a hurdle with all that downward pressure
6270343 an official from the state general administration of sport once told us that if liu cannot win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements will become meaningless
6270344 not just for myself but for my country all asia and the yellow skinned people
6270345 china is a country run by engineers and the thought is always that outcomes can be predetermined thats not a western belief and its not how the world works but drive outside beijing theres whole cities built out of nothing their sense is that if you want a gold medal you build the right structure and do the training and you can do it and the idea that you can predetermine outcome is being proven here the chinese made the decision that they were going to win 40 gold medals and they did it but not all outcomes can be predetermined with liu xiang the structure didnt work thats why the chinese people are having problems digesting his injury
6270346 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
6270347 you dont expect certain people to just show up to eat
6270348 but you include the entire district so you have to consider the dietary needs of everyone at the table as well as the benefits of the meal
6270349 there is no funding stream for intervention and no resources for prevention we need to find ways to get people refinanced galvanize key stakeholders around these issues and make sure a true agenda is at the table
6270350 uproot those who are poor and push them out to suburban areas or economically harsh places
6270351 i will make sure that people in north minneapolis have priority when those opportunities come forth
6270352 i plan to work with the school board to regain confidence in schools its a question of trust and we need to find ways to make sure that trust is invigorated and identify where weve fallen short
6270353 we dont have the resources to handle the well documented achievement gap so why dont we make businesses accountable to invest as well
6270354 we need consistent predictable and sustainable revenue streams to fully fund education instead of accepting business as usual
6270355 im an example of that of a poor kid being afforded the opportunity to go to college the value of education is that important and im up to the challenge
6270356 we cant arrest the problem away we need to hold the police accountable for policing our community their job is to serve and protect not to rule and govern
6270357 we cant have kids not having things to do i had options
6270358 unfortunately the philanthropic community in the late 70s and early 80s decided recreation and development are no longer important
6270359 change minds and allow youth to see themselves outside of their circumstances
6270360 we need to re energize and re value our community jewels and the community should make the case to government and the philanthropic community
6270361 thats different from outsiders telling us whats wrong we can do a better job of marketing our own assets that way well continue to get partners to see the value in our district because were promoting it
6270362 small businesses are the backbone of the economy in order for businesses to grow they need contracts and opportunities its important to diversify funding streams to provide livable wages or else people are threatened to become the working poor
6270363 you have to chart out your desired outcome then move backward
6270364 you have to find those places and spaces where the people are
6270365 there are critical issues not being responded to or articulated and there have to be more aggressive strategies in place a laid back style wont work in our community it requires real time action dont wait for them to call you
6270366 we have to work together to have kids excel in school
6270367 i believe that light rail should be going through north minneapolis
6270368 folks are building all around us and the business will go there too
6270369 but we need to work on visibility of what we have done
6270370 i ran because district 58b was lacking opportunity for children adults and seniors i saw that were not getting to where we wanted to be
6270371 we have been assuming that the ways in which emotions are organized in the brain are essentially similar in men and women
6270372 im kind of hurt that you forgot i hate sushi
6270373 excel in being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6270374 el objeto es implementar en cada uno de estos municipios un programa de inspecci n conjunta a descargas de aguas residuales potencialmente contaminantes que se vierten a las redes de alcantarillado municipal verificando el cumplimiento de la normatividad vigente en esta materia
6270375 como dicen en estados unidos homemade es decir como hecho casa porque me tom el tiempo necesario para incluir 13 temas y en donde por vez primera escribo todas las canciones algunas son coautor as pero todas tuvieron su proceso est n las mejores
6270376 es una canci n que las pocas veces que la he cantado en vivo he sentido que me da fuerza que puedo gritar que quiero luchar porque no nos podemos dar por vencidos ni en el amor ni en la vida ni en nada
6270377 todo ha sido muy r pido lo bonito ha sido ver la transformaci n del estudiante de m sica que a n no sab a cu l ser a su destino que lo nico que ten a claro era que le gustaba la m sica y deseaba una oportunidad de ser escuchado

6270379 sab a que ten a que hacer el disco m s importante de mi carrera y los ltimos cinco a os estuve pensando qu quer a hacer hice una lista de las cosas que quer a desde m sicos productores ingenieros y cuestiones que el p blico no se llega a enterar quer a cuidar todo y cantar a dueto con artistas que admiro era una posibilidad
6270380 en realidad no fue tan planeado como pudiera parecer el tema ya lo hab a escrito hace casi seis a os y la idea era que cuatro voces masculinas le cantaran a la mujer pero nunca supe qu hacer hasta que en el proceso del disco tuve contacto con noel y syntek y en el caso de david bisbal es uno de mis mejores amigos y ambos hemos cantado en nuestras respectivas giras cantar con ellos definitivamente era una asignatura pendiente
6270381 es muy interesante el salir de mi g nero aunque debo confesar que me sent como si me lanzara de un paraca das con los ojos cerrados sin embargo no result algo tan diferente porque la canci n me permite hacerle cambios es un tema que puede ser vestido en diferentes g neros y eso abre puertas a otros mercados
6270382 me siento m s maduro aunque estoy conciente que personalmente me falta muchas cosas por pasar y me gustar a pensar que m s que pasar cosas dif ciles las he sobrepasado a nivel profesional casi todo ha sido positivo y no me gustar a cambiar nada porque he crecido durante el camino sin perder mi honestidad
6270383 people are being picked up at the airport and disappearing the organic cause of the eritrean crisis is the present one party dictatorship our puny tyrant is doing it
6270384 we considered ourselves so special so different instead of putting our faith in the rule of law we put it in a man who is weak and flawed like the rest of us
6270385 the fact is that there has been a lot of progress under the government they have built 500 hospitals put in paved roads reduced malaria deaths by 40 percent and built small dams and electrification projects in rural areas
6270386 did that make him a great leader yes there are new schools but who is attending them there are 197 000 eritrean refugees in sudan and who is responsible for that
6270387 no sabemos qu ser pero s lo deseo que est bien y sano

6270393 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
6270394 he was going to give me 10 000 and i would take the rest of the 80 000 and place it in a charity to help the poor

6270396 i dont know whether i can be nice to anybody that comes up to me
6270397 a du shell marketed by their manufacturers as the silver bullet is made up of a du penetrator rod encase in a light metal backed up by explosive when fired the du slices through tank armour like butter catching fire du is pyrophoric and aerosolizing into a very fine uranium ceramic dust a typical silver bullet fired from an a10 warthog or harrier jet contains 300 grams of du these planes are equipped with 30mm gatling guns that can fire 3900 shells per minute usually every fifth shell is a silver bullet this means that either of these planes could release 234 kilograms of du in a minute estimates are that over 300 tonnes of du was dropped on southern iraq and only about 10 tonnes on the balkans
6270398 just as gunpowder made obsolete castles and knights in armor so likewise big and small uranium metal shells and warheadsmay now have now made aircraft carriers cruisers and armoured personel carriers of empire obsolete andnow so easily totallydestroyed
6270399 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6270400 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
6270401 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 see picture was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots
6270402 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
6270403 if youre going to take out the heart obviously the heart starts up again or you couldnt do the transplant so its clearly not irreversible
6270404 to my standard the person is not dead taking the heart of somebody when theres a question of whether theyre dead or not is a serious concern
6270405 a temptation to bend the standards of futility in order to increase the supply of donors
6270406 while it sounds very erudite for the authors of the study to refer to withdrawing futile care in their population what exactly this means is neither defined by them nor is there a generally accepted meaning of this term in medical or medical ethics circles
6270407 in consideration of the fairness of the competition said a statement from the event organizers at the track

6270410 we are now monitoring the fuel price in the international market and i hope it will continue its downward trend
6270411 using taxpayer money to bail them out looks like its becoming reality now
6270412 is the single most important factor to their ability to remain liquid
6270413 this whole backstop mechanism was set up so the actual need for it could be avoided
6270414 continues to have strong access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
6270415 treasury is monitoring market developments vigilantly we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests
6270416 i think a path like what chairman greenspan suggested is probably the best path
6270417 the conditions dont seem to be turning into a good environment
6270418 it hasnt restored any faith it just highlighted their problems
6270419 the market has come to accept the fact that the government has got to do something
6270420 while the plan was extraordinarily aggressive it seems that the market is looking for something even more explicit and more guidance about what form that will take
6270421 that is where the motorway was built 40 years ago and it didnt leave much
6270422 clearly in this case there was a very abnormal pattern of rainfall and it
6270423 our priority has been to get the underpass open to traffic and now we are
6270424 sometimes people get passed between a large number of agencies we are striving to get a single number in place that wont stop the rainfall but often a complaint after these incidents is about the ability to contact the authorities we are hoping to have something moving on that in october
6270425 imagine being buried deep in sand and wanting to move but cannot
6270426 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6270427 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6270428 camaradas s siento y comparto la rabia contenida que albergan sus corazones por los hechos ocurridos en los ltimos tiempos contra la instituci n policial quiero decirles con toda firmeza y sin dudar que no permitiremos m s ultrajes a nuestra instituci n del orden y mucho menos el atropello a la investidura de nuestras autoridades y efectivos policiales
6270429 pacos malditos raza maldita hijos de puta mal paridos cholos asesinos independencia se van a tener que ir
6270430 al sinverg enza de rada no lo reconocemos en santa cruz
6270431 el excelent simo asesino presidente de los bolivianos es el verdadero responsable criminal quiere comunizar el pa s no respeta mujeres no respeta a la prensa
6270432 un segundo pueblo que se llama santa cruz al que usted evo morales odia con tanta sa a le dice que tiene que disculparse p blicamente
6270433 a los cobardes a usted garc a linera cobarde la gente le grita maric n a garc a linera que tembl de miedo cuando sancionamos la elecci n a subgobernadores
6270434 y le dije que tenga respeto que no sabe con qui n estaba hablando
6270435 el pr ximo comandante de la polic a va a ser bajo mi mando que soy comandante general del departamento no voy a posesionar a ning n comandante m s sino es bajo mi tuici n
6270436 nos vamos en paz y con la conciencia tranquila que no provoquen m s porque la paciencia tiene un l mite y se est agotando
6270437 no descartamos ninguna medida aunque salga la polic a y el ej rcito no vamos a tener miedo
6270438 se est convocando a la poblaci n por los abusos que la polic a cometi contra los discapacitados
6270439 la gasificaci n continu anoche la polic a corri a los j venes unionistas
6270440 nos est n llamando y criticando por mostrar los rostros de los que agredieron al comandante en pat no estamos de acuerdo con la violencia
6270441 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
6270442 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
6270443 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
6270444 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso
6270445 los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en am rica
6270446 ahora los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en numerosos gobiernos de nuestros pa ses con una conciencia diferente este proceso de cambios que est empezando con tantas ganas con una energ a creadora que viene desde abajo y justo por esto ser capaz de construir una realidad diferente
6270447 la mal llamada libertad de comercio es una libertad que enjaula y una gran mentira porque es el nombre que el norte del mundo da a todo lo que no practica pero es todo lo que predica y como el paraguay de los l pez cometi el grave pecado de proteger sus propios productos e impedir el paso de la avalancha de los productos brit nicos y no se at al cuello la soga de la deuda externa que nos ahorca fue castigado
6270448 para saber si un gobierno rey o presidente agrada o no a dios hay que preguntar c mo ese gobierno trata a los pobres porque si los trata bien significa que est del lado de dios

6270453 its first day it easily beats the 5 036 units
6270454 this is a positive step but it will only usher pakistan into a possible democracy
6270455 what we need are checks and balances the rule of law and an independent judiciary without that there will be no way to keep the corrupt politicians in line
6270456 the army had lost peoples respect and now it has done the right thing to win it back
6270457 this is a golden opportunity for the politicians but if they mess up again it may not last long
6270458 these fundamentalist groups are everywhere now this is the big challenge i am hopeful that the democratic system can do better than dictatorship but i cannot imagine how any government even with the best intentions can bring peace
6270459 the social contract is broken legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously
6270460 capitol briefing apologizes for the error and will be more careful as he continues to report this story
6270461 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6270462 she was the peaceful one and i was the impossible one
6270463 i dont get it how was hillarys bid bad news for women

6270468 while this number may look small compared to the number of hiv infected people globally
6270469 the number of infections appears to be increasing rapidly in the country
6270470 mongolia has a low hiv prevalence less that 0 1 percent with only 25 reported cases of hiv by 2006 among a population of 2 6 million however the situation is changing rapidly with 15 of the 25 cases reported in 2005 and 2006
6270471 at least 500 people are infected with hiv in mongolia
6270472 doctors and those who work with hiv aids in mongolia have stated that for every one that has been made public there could 200 behind that person
6270473 the young man is 20 25 years old and came to ulaanbaatar from the countryside to study at a university three weeks ago he had an hiv aids test that came back negative however within the last three weeks he slept with a prostitute without using a condom after this he felt that he should get another test and yesterday it came back positive he reported sleeping with seven women since giving the previous test and he reported that most of them were students two of these students have now been given tests
6270474 la creaci n de este fondo permitir el acceso a recursos y mejorar el bienestar de las personas con discapacidad que son nuestros hermanos y para el gobierno es un buen avance para que no est n al margen del cambio que favorece a los sectores sociales vulnerables
6270475 esperamos que ahora se discuta la aplicaci n efectiva de la ley en concertaci n con el sector y cese el conflicto que lastima
6270476 lo nico que queremos es terminar con el estado unitario que es justamente por lo que est peleando el gobierno y eso es la raz n por la cual choca contra la autonom a
6270477 confederaci n de estados y eso no es ning n pecado porque los pa ses m s avanzados siguen este r gimen este sistema
6270478 pol tica confrontacional desde el occidente para dividir a la familia cruce a por mercenarios pagados
6270479 que no es santa cruz el que se quiere separar de bolivia sino que es bolivia la que se quiere separar de santa cruz
6270480 la mentalidad andina no nos reconoce como cambas ni como cruce os ni como bolivianos y por lo tanto nosotros no estamos obligados a serlo parece doloroso pero tenemos que reconocer que nosotros nos parecemos a nosotros mismos y esto nos obliga a definir un escenario de acci n
6270481 establecer las bases conceptuales de un modelo de estado auton mico de plataforma federal y que tiene por objetivo el de establecer relaciones igualitarias entre partes iguales entre el estado a ser creado y el poder estatal andino
6270482 una etapa de transici n entre el centralismo colonial y su reflejo el unitarismo ultramontano creado por las oligarqu as comerciantes mineras y las burocracias parasitarias que se alimentan del excedente estatal a costa del atraso y la miseria de los pueblos
6270483 que no tiene ni tendr la capacidad para autogenerar su propio desarrollo y menos a n para enfrentarse eficientemente a los acelerados proceso de integraci n continental
6270484 ich bin immer noch frustriert aber wenn es mit der medaille klappt wird die freude berwiegen
6270485 sie hat probleme wenn sie tief einatmet aber ich bin sehr optimistisch dass sie spielen kann
6270486 meist sehen wir gegen holland ganz gut aus sie spielen offensiv und kommen nicht so gut mit unserer defensivtaktik zurecht
6270487 our goal is for the new facilities to have a positive impact on the recruitment of prospective students
6270488 these facilities are not just about the athletic department but the entire university we are building toward a better future for everyone associated with osu and stillwater
6270489 when all of that is completed i think its going to be spectacular
6270490 this is the time for everyone to ask the question what can i do to make a difference in the future of my university and there is no better place to create positive energy than saturday afternoons in boone pickens stadium cheering for the cowboys
6270491 everyone needs to put on their game face saddle up and ride for the osu brand
6270492 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6270493 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6270494 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6270495 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6270496 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6270497 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6270498 you are required by law to stay at the scene of an accident and share information so obviously thats why it progresses to a hit and run investigation
6270499 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl

6270506 does not have a fixed budget for how much it is going to invest
6270507 we have plans to serve lager and red and white wine that is what the average punter wants
6270508 we try to leverage situations like this to grow into new markets
6270509 where theres instability in prices buyers tend to be more open to new sourcing and thats a general market strategy not just green
6270510 our products are made from a corn derivative and our competition uses petroleum they are having price increases where our prices are stable
6270511 so our raw materials prices arent going up many other raw materials are linked to petroleum products so everyone elses costs are going up
6270512 it creates a system thats less volatile and benefits us in times like this

6270520 you go into a process like this and you have no idea what to expect from it me being this regular single dad from seattle you have no idea
6270521 but you can really find somebody in a show like that if they look for the right people to cast anything is possible
6270522 i am in a place where i could start dating again but to be honest i dont even know how right now my focus is on getting back to work and just being a dad right now im just back to my everyday life with ty and thats perfect for me
6270523 spurning his fellow republicans uncharacteristic effort to borrow their way out of budget trouble
6270524 i think the parent ought to perform the act of punishment
6270525 theres a list your parents will put you on it if they think you need it
6270526 she just said bend over and put your hands on the desk and gave me three swats
6270527 i think its great if the child deserves it and its for the right reasons
6270528 suspending him and sending him home on a vacation doesnt do any good
6270529 i just think it shouldnt be allowed your parents should handle that i dont think the teachers should handle that
6270530 the eeriness of the voice in his ear a woman who described exactly what he was looking at but wasnt there
6270531 baseball is a red blooded sport for red blooded men its no pink tea and mollycoddles had better stay out its a struggle for supremacy a survival of the fittest

6270536 the timing of this partnership is perfect as the indian market is experiencing strong aircraft growth with manufacturers bullish on aircraft orders
6270537 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6270538 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6270539 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6270540 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6270541 i havent got the confidence for that and i definitely dont have any rhythm
6270542 trying to be invisible and get on with my job
6270543 ive been a lot more open in the last couple of years since ive met my wife
6270544 shes a lot more outgoing and thats definitely been a help getting comfortable with the news media when i entered racing i didnt think it was a big deal but it is youve got to soak it up
6270545 i dont get out of the car and talk smack
6270546 he appears to be this mellow guy that everything bounces off and he doesnt get too amped up its almost the opposite once he pushes the button to go racing for the first practice you wont find a more strong willed guy
6270547 things that screw us up on the track i go nuts
6270548 but they receive it well and do the same when i mess up
6270549 hes very funny i would call him far from quiet
6270550 i like the competitive aspect but theres a fine line between bravery and stupidity were not talking about jack mildren and oklahoma thats not how you do it we want him to play 16 games
6270551 but were not looking for yards after contact from the quarterback thats ok for running backs but not quarterbacks
6270552 and hes not afraid to yell at lineman see i think i like him because hes a lot like me
6270553 i think youll see a completely different player this year
6270554 if i play well were going to have a good season ive never been that guy holding the team up so i dont want to be that guy now im working my butt off to get to the point where im looked at as one of the guys helping to carry this team
6270555 when you have the chance to drive the dagger you need to air mail it people are flat footed trying to defend against adrian peterson so we need to be better if we just want to dial it up on first down
6270556 theres always been someone who seems to come from the bottom to the top
6270557 theres not going to be emphasis on that guy at the bottom if youre one of those bottom guys you need to understand the history and understand what it takes to reach your goals i was one of those guys who set my goals and went after them and i was able to accomplish them
6270558 the one thing that set me apart was that i didnt make the same mistake twice
6270559 whatever coaching pointer or critique i would get i learned from it and never made that mistake again
6270560 a lot of guys can get over 1 000 yards if they carry the ball enough
6270561 if you can average in that 5 yards a carry range youre doing something special
6270562 some guys are able to withstand that punishment week in and week out
6270563 other guys cant take the punishment and cant take the number of carries the key is if you do carry the ball 25 times a game can you keep that quickness and speed and that endurance throughout the game all those questions will be answered as time goes on
6270564 i feel i have the ability to set myself apart from other guys in the league
6270565 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6270566 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest

6270569 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6270570 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6270571 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6270572 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6270573 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message

6270582 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs joness medical condition declined
6270583 medical doctors and neurosurgeons from huron hospital and cleveland clinic sadly report that at 6 12 p m congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones died
6270584 she dedicated her life in public service to helping others and will continue to do so through organ donations
6270585 please keep her family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time
6270586 we dont know how either animal got out were concerned about the public
6270587 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past
6270588 were mortgaging the future of people who cant vote and might not even be born yet
6270589 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances

6270592 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6270593 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6270594 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6270595 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6270596 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail

6270602 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6270603 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6270604 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6270605 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6270606 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
6270607 in rock your face off 101 we listen to the angst and the music of the lost generation and we rock our faces off

6270616 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6270617 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule

6270660 assessing past present and near future of the global energy market
6270661 recent work suggests that there are enough hydrocarbons available at production costs far below current oil prices for society to substitute alternative sources before depletion becomes a problem
6270662 a key question is whether there are enough resources to satisfy consumption rates
6270663 once the model was validated it was used to estimate the recoverable conventional hydrocarbon volumes of the 937 petroleum provinces of the world out of which 528 had not been evaluated previously these results indicate that there are enough recoverable hydrocarbons to satisfy energy requirements for the next several decades in our opinion this will provide sufficient time for society to substitute other energy sources perhaps unconventional or nonfossil
6270664 the global reserve resource base can easily meet forecast demand growth for decades to come estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves urr have increased over time with advancing technology enhanced recovery and new reservoir development for example according to an established industry source reserve growth from improved recovery alone in existing fields amounted to 175 billion barrels in 1995 2003 combined with new discoveries of 138 billion barrels total reserve growth was therefore well above the cumulative production of 236 billion barrels for that period moreover technology continues to blur the distinction between conventional and non conventional oil of which there is also abundance as well as with other fossil fuels we expect the worlds urr to continue to increase in the future therefore the real issue is not reserve availability but timely deliverability and here enhanced cooperation and dialog among all parties is essential to ensure security of demand as well as security of supply
6270665 the cost is about dealing with loss and the processes one might use to help get things back to a better balance in life
6270666 loss can cover a lot of ground but the cost is focused on two areas in particular love and freedom how each are tied together and how each must maintain their autonomy in order to flourish

6270703 our only goal is to execute and finish every day every play that sounds like a cop out but if we do that well have success in the end
6270704 we want to finish first or second in everything we do from recruiting to everything else as for that prediction we finished fifth last year i dont think anybody could think that would fit well for us intuitively
6270705 nine or 10 linebackers are going to want to get on the bus to army and were going to only have room for four so you can imagine how fierce that competition is if some of them are going to make the bus its going to be on special teams
6270706 we played with a lot of guys this year who are not starters for us this year and thats a good sign for our team
6270707 today was the first day we looked at army and thursday will be the first day well practice for army nine days is more than enough time

6270711 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6270712 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6270713 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6270714 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria
6270715 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all

6270733 to be honest im not capable enough to get a job now maybe ill find a job one or two years later
6270734 if i did more challenging work it would put more pressure on me
6270735 and i dont know if i could do it very well
6270736 i was very nervous and didnt know what to do or how to do it so that day was a terrible day

6270738 if you love your work you must keep working hard every moment so people whore supporting you wont be disappointed

6270740 all the volunteers feel it no matter how hard the task theyll spare no effort to do it
6270741 work very hard though we met and will meet many difficulties we always work together
6270742 it may look good on your resume and be good for future job hunting as it shows you can be responsible
6270743 like everyone else they will have this experience on their resume so it wont make that much of a difference
6270744 it wasnt an issue until the beginning of this year when the networks started broadcasting different hd content
6270745 people are now understanding more about what they are missing out on so the issue will just become bigger
6270746 seven and ten did a great job of advertising them their hd channels but we failed as a group to tell consumers that if you invested in an sd product you wont get all the hd channels
6270747 ten did the masters golf only on its hd channel so we had consumers bringing their tvs back because they couldnt see the golf
6270748 we were giving away hd boxes to consumers to appease their perception at the point of sale
6270749 so our concern about education is not the analogue to digital issue but the clarification of what digital tv you buy
6270750 the confusion needs to be eliminated so in terms of labelling not only do we need to state that this product is digital but that if you get hd you get all the channels
6270751 the secret about my business is the broadcasters offering content
6270752 algebra doesnt have to be difficult to learn or teach especially when we begin introducing these concepts at an early age
6270753 preparing all students for success in algebra at grade 8 requires a strong early algebra curriculum as well as a curriculum that focuses on developing concepts and skills involving fractions too many students find algebra challenging because of a poor background in fractions envisionmath develops the essential understandings and skills related to fractions needed for success in algebra
6270754 algebra concepts and skills need not be mysterious to teachers or students when they are taught with a focus on sense making furthermore all teachers can successfully teach algebra and all students can successfully learn algebra when teaching and learning are guided by envisionmath
6270755 our elementary grades program reflects the latest research about learning mathematics and already fills a void from an old model that essentially no longer exists
6270756 envisionmath sets a new standard in laying this crucial early foundation for success
6270757 one of the other critical programs we are offering for california is an algebra readiness fixed term course for eighth grade students who are not yet prepared for algebra 1
6270758 virtually all of the research in recent years confirms that in order for our students to compete in the global 21st century economy they simply must improve significantly in their understanding of math concepts and skills
6270759 mathematics is a significant obstacle for many students but this can no longer be acceptable
6270760 algebra readiness is clearly the area where we believe school districts will see the biggest impact for the money they decide to spend on new programs
6270761 it is discouraging that the state budget deficit is keeping some school districts from implementing these new programs at a time when they are most needed
6270762 middle school is what you might call the bermuda triangle of education because a significant percentage of californias kids fall behind and eventually drop out of school at this level
6270763 by focusing on algebra readiness with innovative research based programs with built in intervention and assessment we can not only do a better job of retaining students but also give them the skills and confidence to realize that they can be successful in math
6270764 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further
6270765 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6270766 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6270767 special constables and police support volunteers are a vital part of our modern police service
6270768 every day of the week specials are making a real difference responding to peoples concerns and making communities safer places to live the funding i am announcing today will ensure that the special constabulary can grow and continue their outstanding work
6270769 the nine new regional co ordinators will drive forward a more targeted approach to the recruitment and development of special constables
6270770 they will work closely with the local forces and the acpo regional leads to identify need and provide solutions to enable more people to become involved and contribute to the policing of their communities through the role of special constable
6270771 i hope they take good care of ed mcmahon because he deserves it the only reason anybody other than me would be interested in this house is because i showed an interest in it first
6270772 i just heard that the person negotiating doesnt have financing and the deal would be subject to getting financing something which i obviously dont need
6270773 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6270774 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6270775 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6270776 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6270777 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6270778 that is the reason why we are looking at the buyback and why so much of it is geared towards the northern end of the system
6270779 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6270780 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6270781 as ever with sonys cyber shot range the dsc w300 is as much about style as substance the metal build quality suggests this is a camera that youll still be using a few years down the line a feeling backed up by that whopping 13 megapixel resolution plus its plentifully large and bright rear lcd look back at a camera from four or five years ago when 1 5 inches was the norm and find a product looking positively prehistoric unfortunately though while images appear fine when viewed in isolation anyone who has handled a wide variety of digital compacts as us reviewers are privileged to do will discover that image quality is perhaps the least impressive aspect of the w300 thats a shame as among its bridge cameras im thinking of the h50 and dslrs alpha 350 at the mid range sony has delivered some surprisingly impressive photographic models of late all that being said noise is handled very well and shots do require a minimal amount of post processing out of the camera so in that respect the sony cyber shot dsc w300 could be said to be ideally suited to its target market of the undemanding snapper who requires visual aide memoirs delivered with the minimum of fuss

6270875 if in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics
6270876 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6270877 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896
6270878 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6270879 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6270880 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6270881 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view
6270882 ive had a rough day i deserve not to have to exercise
6270883 this is the one thing in my life that i am so unhappy about and it is something that is completely in my own control yet i dont change
6270884 there has been a lot of doubt within the international community that there are health outcomes of health tests and patient centred consultations within primary care
6270885 in denmark general practitioners are gate keepers to the entire health system almost all danes are ascribed to specific general practitioners such findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should now consider implementing health tests and consultations more widely
6270886 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6270887 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6270888 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small
6270889 electrical energy storage is very important for all electrical and electronic systems
6270890 even renewable energy systems like solar cells need somewhere to store excess energy to be used at night
6270891 traditional materials are ceramic materials which have high weight and are very fragile
6270892 matching the permittivity and uniformly dispersing the ceramic nanoparticles is not easy
6270893 both problems have to be tackled and solved at the same time for the material to have the desired characteristics
6270894 cette rate tait succulente servie avec de la roquette et de la gorgonzola
6270895 it took me four years or even longer to train for this medal coach chen chen xiong cried when i gave him a hug because we devoted so much effort and time the gold medal deserves our pride
6270896 the gold is heavy i will value it as many people have made efforts for the achievement
6270897 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6270898 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6270899 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6270900 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6270901 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6270902 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6270903 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6270904 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6270905 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
6270906 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use
6270907 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6270908 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6270909 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6270910 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6270911 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6270912 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6270913 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6270914 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6270915 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6270916 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6270917 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6270918 going back to the question of 10gige there is no way you could interconnect 25 000 nodes using 10gb ethernet today there just isnt the equipment available for that we could do so at some cost even today but its not insurmountable for somebody who has significant communication and computation needs and the appropriate budget they could use our techniques to deliver 10gige all the way out to the edge servers
6270919 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6270920 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6270921 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6270922 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6270923 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6270924 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6270925 we learned that even though we were using the same molecule all were composed of molybdenum and sulfur size and structure is important in determining reactivity
6270926 the most reactive nanocluster of those that we tested had six atoms of molybdenum and eight atoms of sulfur it readily absorbed sulfur and let go of carbon monoxide which makes it an effective catalyst
6270927 size selected deposition of transition metal sulfides insights toward model systems in catalysis
6270928 its not necessary to expose a large surface of the brain in order to access a small abnormality
6270929 because the openings are smaller less brain tissue is exposed
6270930 theres less blood loss surgery times are shorter and patients spend less time in the hospital its better cosmetically too smaller incisions leave smaller scars
6270931 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6270932 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
6270933 i think that a major field of application will be to help manufacturers abide by the european union law concerning the ban of dog and cat fur trade next year
6270934 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6270935 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6270936 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6270937 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6270938 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6270939 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well
6270940 our results are the best prediction we can make with the information available now but it will be critical to update the analysis as we learn more about the long term vaccine effects
6270941 este es un buen equipo que no ha jugado muy mal aunque ha tenido distracciones que a lo mejor lo han llevado a no tener los resultados
6270942 recibo al equipo con agrado si me vinieron a buscar es porque las cosas no est n bien y por eso la tarea es dura
6270943 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6270944 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6270945 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6270946 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6270947 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6270948 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6270949 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6270950 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6270951 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6270952 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6270953 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6270954 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6270955 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6270956 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6270957 the critical problem in the murray darling basin is one that no government can easily fix mr burke said to sky news
6270958 in an age of climate change and during a prolonged drought we simply have less water in the basin
6270959 part of trying to deal with that is the water buyback and the problem with queensland is dealt with by the fact that of the 400 million we have reserved as part of the buyback 350 million is being reserved for queensland
6270960 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6270961 so i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel and the water that they know would produce a profitable crop in a properly irrigated area simply isnt available on zero allocations
6270962 that is the reason why we are looking at the buyback and why so much of it is geared towards the northern end of the system
6270963 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
6270964 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
6270965 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
6270966 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
6270967 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
6270968 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide insect outbreaks may become more frequent with future warming as well and our results also suggest an important role of such outbreaks in reducing shrubs
6270969 on the practical and policy sides of this story we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
6270970 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6270971 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6270972 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6270973 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6270974 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6270975 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6270976 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6270977 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6270978 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6270979 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6270980 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6270981 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6270982 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6270983 we are not aware of any australians involved in the incident however our embassy in madrid is in contact with local authorities hospitals and the airline to ascertain if any australians are affected a dfat spokeswoman said
6270984 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6270985 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6270986 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6270987 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6270988 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6270989 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6270990 its a little bit of a drag because flying is sort of my downtime
6270991 but its fantastic to be connected for the productivity you get i was also able to chat and watch my slingbox video
6270992 there will be peaks and valleys but thats the nature of the beast with wireless
6270993 but imagine trying to run wires up to 30 000 feet

6270997 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult mr larkin said
6270998 the environment has created a number of challenges for the group which we are actively working through at the current time to reach resolutions which endeavour to weigh the interests of all stakeholder groups
6270999 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6271000 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6271001 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said
6271002 this has led to the group being too highly leveraged and not sufficiently focussed
6271003 in view of the changed market environment we are taking the necessary steps to reduce the leverage and refocus the group on the areas where we can best deliver earnings growth without taking undue risk
6271004 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state government advisers mr achterstraat said
6271005 we found they were generally consistent with other privatisations and restructures except in the case of the five year employment guarantee for certain generator employees which is greater than the guarantees in previous privatisations he said
6271006 all i remember is that i saw the flash and i pulled him to get him out of the way of the blast thats all i remember
6271007 a piece of shrapnel had taken out my seat where i was sitting it probably would have killed me
6271008 i went to disneyland and the cannons starting firing off the ship
6271009 and here i am low crawling across the ground knowing full well that im in disneyland but my bodys reacting
6271010 to get back into the work force and be able to see that i can succeed and that what i wrote down on my resume is true and that i can do it and i have a lot to offer has really decreased stress
6271011 to overcome those obstacles and being able to be out in the work force has really helped emphasize that i can do it and i can succeed
6271012 we cant lose their productivity we cant lose their skills we cant lose their value to society
6271013 these are human beings that deserve the opportunity to continue doing what it is they want to do which is to continue to be productive in society
6271014 an initiative like this is terribly important because if youre going to have one in five veterans coming home with this theyre just not people we can afford to forget or lose
6271015 they didnt forget us they did their job and we cant forget them
6271016 what labor is trying is to do in my judgment is help employers understand that if you support the employee hell perk back up again
6271017 its a bit like being on team with a good coach youve got a good coach that performer somehow finds an extra amount of energy an extra effort
6271018 what were hoping to do is to give each one of these veterans a little bit of extra coaching a little bit of extra help that will get them to the finish line
6271019 the united states of america will continue to support georgias democracy
6271020 will continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgian people
6271021 south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6271022 going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal
6271023 determined that business as usual cannot continue with russia and the alliance agreed to help georgia by sending nato teams to assess the countrys needs and by forming a new nato georgia commission
6271024 when i look at the images i can feel the emotion
6271025 blah blah we accepted you under the assumption you wanted to complete the major before you applied to vet school
6271026 i believe the children are our future teach them well and let them lead the way
6271027 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6271028 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6271029 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6271030 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6271031 america owes the men and women of the vfw a debt that could really never be repaid
6271032 you fought for our freedoms and then when you came home you volunteered to continue to serve this nation
6271033 i want to thank the members of the armed forces that are here today
6271034 there is no greater honor than being the commander in chief of the united states military and im proud to be in your presence
6271035 who served in distant lands should have to live without shelter in the land they fought to defend
6271036 to help our wounded warriors build lives of hope and promise and dignity

6271046 just because the price has dropped a little that doesnt mean its going to stay there
6271047 will people be driving more at 4 than they would have if gas went up to 5 the answer has to be definitely yes
6271048 but 4 is not 2 its still a big hit to your pocketbook

6271050 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6271051 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown

6271059 how can they do this we are talking about peoples lives these commercial vehicle drivers are also those who ply passengers from one destination to another
6271060 think of the public and their safety i view this issue as very serious
6271061 the ministry and mmc can take action only if there is an official complaint
6271062 we need details such as the name of the doctor and when and where he or she committed the offence
6271063 for 17 years i have had a very hands on role
6271064 but i believe if we are to take advantage of this marketplace i need to utilise my skills where i can get the most bang for buck we have a professional ceo to take the burden on the operational side and i can work with the management team to work out how to work out the best way to take advantage of the opportunities out there

6271068 si el pedido de suspensi n de la otra parte es acogido por los jueces el juicio queda suspendido y los imputados deber an cumplir con ciertas pautas en caso de que el pedido sea rechazado los imputados pueden recurrir por eso hay pocas probabilidades de que se resuelva r pidamente son muchos detalles que hay que tener en cuenta

6271074 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6271075 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6271076 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6271077 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6271078 a group of twin cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 republican national convention in st paul
6271079 weve been painted in that bad light being compared to terrorist attacks on the xcel energy center or chemical weapons or other forms of violence that we are criticized for
6271080 its important for people to know we are not as scary as people make us out to be
6271081 our tactics are not terroristic if anything i would call them empowering
6271082 all that means is you are going to stay in an intersection or a place and not leave when the police ask them to leave
6271083 essentially anything that will stop or slow down traffic in this case the traffic of the delegates could be considered a blockade
6271084 engage in nonviolent civil disobedience peacefully preventing the delegates access the xcel center
6271085 its not part of it but we do know there are people who follow the philosophy that some property supports violence and enables violence to happen
6271086 there really is an open debate about it we are just glad this debate can happen and that people can be a part of that debate
6271087 we dont want to say that we condone property violence or that we support it but we also dont want to say we are against it as well
6271088 anarchism is easily the most understood pol theory in america today so much so that newspapers use the silly phrase self described anarchists
6271089 the media says direct action is synonymous with violence that anarchism is the philosophy with the end goal of chaos and disorder
6271090 i think the key issue is people taking control of their own lives rather than offering up their compliance by being satisfied by giving someone else control of it
6271091 a lot of people out there who dont know what an anarchist is might be an anarchist themselves if they look into it a bit its more about creating an environment and community where cooperation is essentially what keeps a community running not coercion
6271092 its very community based knowing who your neighbors are anarchy doesnt mean chaos in the streets breaking windows all these misconceptions a lot of what we do is community based everyone on an equal level with one another
6271093 it isnt about creating something big but making things smaller making communities smaller revolution should be the byproduct

6271311 tenemos excelente evidencia de v nculos entre osama bin laden agentes de al qaeda y lo que sucedi el 11 de septiembre
6271312 hab a que presentar pruebas de que el ataque terrorista del 11 de septiembre provino del exterior sin embargo esa prueba todav a no ha sido suministrada
6271313 he visto evidencia absolutamente poderosa e incontrovertible de su v nculo de osama bin laden con los eventos del 11 de septiembre
6271314 no existe evidencia presentada en el expediente que vincule directamente a bin laden con el 11 de septiembre
6271315 no exist a duda alguna de la responsabilidad de bin laden por los ataques del 11 de septiembre antes de que se descubriera la cinta
6271316 obviamente este hombre es decir bin laden es la personificaci n del mal parece deleitado por haber matado a m s gente de lo que esperaba lo que hace que uno se pregunte lo abstrusos que son realmente sus malvados coraz n y alma
6271317 en los sitios m s importantes en los que se supone que el v deo prueba la culpa de bin laden la traducci n no es id ntica con el rabe
6271318 los traductores estadounidenses que escucharon las cintas y las transcribieron aparentemente escribieron muchas cosas que quer an o r pero que no se pod an escuchar en la cinta no importa cu ntas veces uno la escuchaba
6271319 el motivo por el que no se menciona el 11 s en la p gina del m s buscado de osama bin laden es porque el fbi no posee evidencia concreta que conecte a bin laden con el 11 s
6271320 bin laden no ha sido formalmente acusado en conexi n con el 11 s
6271321 el fbi re ne evidencia una vez que ha reunido la evidencia la entrega al departamento de justicia el departamento de justicia decide si tiene suficiente evidencia para presentarla a un jurado de acusaci n federal en el caso de los atentados contra las embajadas de ee uu en 1998 bin laden fue formalmente culpado y acusado por un jurado de acusaci n no ha sido formalmente culpado y acusado en conexi n con el 11 s porque el fbi no posee evidencia concreta que conecte a bin laden con el 11 s
6271322 no hemos tenido muchas noticias suyas es decir de bin laden y no dir a necesariamente que est al centro de alguna estructura de comando y de nuevo no s donde est yo repito lo que dije verdaderamente no me preocupa tanto su persona

6271341 a liberal needs to say kind things about poor people to gratify himself it simply violates a liberals sense of decency to say something critically true about such people instead he searches for comfortable neutral criticisms such as lack of education overpopulation lack of industry etc to say these things is to say nothing these conditions are co indications of poverty they are not the causes of it people are poor because they behave in ways that result in poverty they breed excessively they spend all their money on immediate desires rather than saving and investing they party every night rather than study and plan they drink they are lazy all these actions result in poverty

6271351 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
6271352 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
6271353 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6271354 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6271355 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6271356 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6271357 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6271358 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time

6271361 we are starting the process very slowly and cautiously and thats why we have only announced 2500 visas across four countries over three years
6271362 at this stage the announcement is only in respect to those pacific island nations
6271363 i have no doubt that there are a number of other nations in our region that would desperately like to be part of our program but we are starting this very cautiously
6271364 these are not full time jobs these are seasonal jobs available for a brief period of time each year and something of particular interest to the pacific nations

6271378 there was a sheik in damascus called abu musa al qumasi
6271379 she said leave me first save my husband who was sitting more or less over there the neighbors removed the debris from the place she had pointed to and found the sheik who said leave me first save my wife who was lying down more or less over there
6271380 when someone acts like this couple they are purifying the whole world through their faith in life and love
6271381 one year ago i gave a speech in an aircraft carrier saying that we had succeeded in reaching an important objective accomplishing a mission which was to remove saddam hussein from power as a result there are no more torture chambers no more mass graves
6271382 we feel that our mouth is sealed or that the words just dont come out however the mere fact of making an effort to overcome this situation is in itself a beneficial attitude
6271383 youre right at such times what you should do is look up at the sky and say lord almighty i am so far from you that i cant even believe my own voice because the truth is that the lord always hears and answers it is we who do not manage to talk for fear that he will pay no attention to us

6271387 we saw that there was a large group of people who werent able to enjoy traditional beers and were very excited that the release of gluten free golden ale will make great beer available to everyone
6271388 the most important part about developing this beer was to make something that tasted really good the fact that it is gluten free makes it all the more unique
6271389 looks like you would be more comfortable getting that thing off too
6271390 why do you always engage me in conversation when im so close to wetting myself
6271391 the new library could be the focal point of a new shopping area like in shirlington and rockville
6271392 but the library says they have to move immediately on building on their own site whats the harm in exploring this alternative would they rather build a library that could be instantly obsolete
6271393 development is necessary and good but i dont think this site is right for it
6271394 you need to keep every inch of land there because the children come first this is not development vs nimbys and id take a polygraph on that
6271395 we are grossly unhappy and concerned about what will happen to harmony hall because of the park services inability to maintain it

6271397 i promised this community were going to stabilize this place and give them a place to relax hear music just be in peace
6271398 its just tragic to see the paint peeling and the plaster crumbling
6271399 its sickening its as if they just want it to burn down
6271400 if we dont make this riverfront into a destination well lose it to more developments
6271401 it competes with the frederick douglass home which we just put 4 million into and with parks such as fort washington
6271402 wed love to do a water trail eventually but its probably not realistic its a slow process
6271403 we started looking at this six to eight weeks ago as an extraordinary remedy
6271404 the court is always going to look to see the importance of what youre trying to attack and how directly your solution addresses that problem
6271405 supportive of the districts desire to be creative and do what they could to combat the ongoing homicide crisis
6271406 almost every assault of any kind is related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6271407 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6271408 you cant touch a toyota or honda at the auction
6271409 we have to pay a premium and then the customer doesnt understand why our price is above book value two more months of this and were out of business
6271410 she was willing to take an 8 000 loss on the bmw just to get her gas payments lower she wanted out of that eight cylinder now
6271411 i said whyd you put all that money into it
6271412 now hes got negative equity in the car he came in to try to lower his monthly outlay and get a cheaper car and pay less in gas but hes going to walk out of here with the same loan payment because he had negative equity on the trade in its a no win situation
6271413 i had already taken so much away from my community with my previous lifestyle
6271414 i go up to bed kind of early maybe look at tv

6271419 it was a beautiful european style gathering place a charming little piece of street culture
6271420 that table is one of the few examples in d c where something unique brought character and life to the street
6271421 i dont know what drives frank to do these things
6271422 do have a function in our society were awfully glad to have them sometimes when things go awry but i never heard anyone complain about the ping pong table and it does bring some life to a stretch of the avenue that doesnt get a lot of foot traffic
6271423 my boys have been playing on it for the last year or more
6271424 with no hazards other than the smiles of passersby good thing we have commissioner winstead to save us from all these perils
6271425 when the first child got hurt chasing a ping pong ball onto connecticut avenue people would feel differently comet was flagrantly violating the public space law
6271426 if james can have a ping pong table out front then why shouldnt golds gym have exercise equipment out on the sidewalk and call it an advertisement
6271427 it is interesting to see how a couple of people can take something everyone loves and make it go away
6271428 im a small family oriented business whos really struggling in a difficult location and its just frustrating to have this kind of conversation when im trying to create a welcoming place
6271429 i want you to keep praying for the charter board to make the right decision on monday
6271430 change can be difficult but well see that god can do wonderful things in ways that we dont expect
6271431 we would no longer be able to appeal to what would jesus do or god is watching
6271432 but we had a passion to keep it as a school even if we cant celebrate jesus christ the virtues of goodness truth and beauty are found outside the confines of the catholic faith or even christianity
6271433 but upon reflection i can still love the children in a christlike way and not talk about it
6271434 you cant ask a job applicant are you gay do you believe in abortion are you muslim or christian just removing the crosses and changing the curriculum isnt making it a public school
6271435 dissuade people from employing people who dont have legal status
6271436 unfortunately when we get a complaint we have to follow up
6271437 this is mere additional frivolous hassling by commissioner winstead marvelous does not have a public space permit but he could simply approach the management and kindly request for them to work through the city channels to accomplish the small task of obtaining one
6271438 we have more than 200 signatures from people in the neighborhood who want us to keep the seating out there
6271439 were happy to go ahead and try to do the right thing
6271440 if you live in d c long enough you know you just do as youre told
6271441 all children even those who do not live with dogs need to know how to act around dogs
6271442 dogs should all have obedience training that is reinforced throughout their lives our kids were raised with dogs and so are our grandchildren no one was ever bitten or hurt because they all knew the rules dogs are an integral part of many families lives and they are not going away we all need to work to make human and canine lives interact harmoniously
6271443 this is bad doggy manners all dogs should go to obedience class as puppies repeat as teens and again as adults if a dog is rambunctious around children the dog should be left at home when walking kids to school
6271444 like most non dog owners who are after all more than two thirds of the population i have no clue how one is supposed to act around a dog nor do i care to know and i see no reason for my children to know unless they decide someday to buy a dog
6271445 my daughter could not read at all not even c a t
6271446 in the d c public schools she was failing and acting out here they refused to let her fail
6271447 when i couldnt bring her because i was working this school sends a teacher to get her every week
6271448 if kids are even barely passing and we can connect with their parents we take them
6271449 sprawl is just a derogatory term applied to the american dream
6271450 we want very much for this to be a big tent
6271451 but the political reality is there is antagonism between the governor and the comptroller lots of people who are strong supporters of the governor but arent strong supporters of peter franchot want to be involved but are holding back it does create a challenge
6271452 there is a misimpression out there that this is just going to pass easily
6271453 the vast majority of individuals who are going to go to these slots parlors are working class families
6271454 because as soon as i get half a mile from state circle people are patting me on the back
6271455 i may be monopolizing the market on wishful thinking here but theres no evidence that the big gambling companies are ramping up for this campaign
6271456 people recoil in horror at the idea that falkland might be demolished
6271457 a pittance compared to losing nine acres of this wonderful community we all support smart growth but it was never intended to mow down everything near a transit hub
6271458 its mainly graduate students who move in these days families dont want to be there
6271459 can you take a michelangelo rip off some of its corners and still retain its value
6271460 after setting off some fireworks outside his mobile home a 37 year old iowa man went inside the home according to the fire department some of the exploded fireworks may have ignited piles of dried leaves near the home the fire spread under the home then engulfed it in flames the victim was unable to escape and died inside the mobile home

6271462 with this agreement the dispute regarding the publictakeover offer by the frankish family owned business has beensettled
6271463 its been several years and shes worked her way up from the pta to animal control to the superintendent of schools the parks department the police she got the county dog officers to come to school and check everyones tags and vaccinations
6271464 danuta even followed me around with a camera and took pictures
6271465 the general feeling is theres an agenda there and we dont know what it is
6271466 i am not a dog owner but shes the only person in the entire community whos upset about this were focused on trying to pass the schools budget in full and shes turning attention to something thats not a problem people walk their kids with their dogs to school every morning and nobody minds
6271467 the school system knows its a problem but they dont want to deal with it
6271468 everybody is afraid to discuss this because they dont want to speak against their neighbors and i am really only interested in the policy not in confronting other parents
6271469 this is not out of character for the type of community we have in bethesda
6271470 we have a lot of type a people who latch on to issues like this and shes right children do come first so since the principal asked people to voluntarily keep their dogs away from school property ive complied completely and so have other parents
6271471 can i get any bidders any buyers any advance on 161 000
6271472 i cannot take my eyes off leonard slatkin the music comes from within him
6271473 the audience will immediately hear a tighter orchestra one thats playing with confidence a musician can tell when somethings been choreographed and when its coming from their soul
6271474 big people make an impact they add a lot of pizzazz
6271475 you will see a lot of change in a short time theres a metamorphosis in the power structure of the city as the older regime kind of fades away
6271476 at this stage were waiting for formal identification procedures to take place before we take the matter any further
6271477 it may have been snagged it may have been under water for a period of time and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface
6271478 not to be an i told you so but i was in jackson square and i predicted that new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city
6271479 i think were making good progress in a lot of respects particularly with levees and infrastructure on the people side theres so much that has to be done and im going to encourage him to continue to push for us until his last day in office
6271480 this isnt a chance for me to be a typical politician and make you a promise that i dont intend to keep
6271481 we are on track to meet our goal of 100 year flood plain protection by the year 2011
6271482 only a fraction of this funding has been invested in our long term recovery
6271483 far too much has been lost to the inefficiency and red tape of fema and the federal bureaucracy as well as the pockets of out of state fema contractors
6271484 this is a part of our country that was flat on its back and is now standing up and headed for the future
6271485 its an awesome example of courage and determination desire and i am here to honor you all
6271486 the competitors here in florida are a bunch of dimwits they didnt bail her out and they cant figure out why someone came from california came to do it theyre just idiots they say dont bail her out or well kill you you son of a bleep they want to try to put us out of business
6271487 do i look like someone whos ever thought about running a half marathon
6271488 a workforce drawn from a diverse base of former special operations defense intelligence and law enforcement professionals ready on a moments notice for global deployment
6271489 the national farmers federation appears to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and opposition spokesman on foreign affairs andrew robb rowing in the exact opposition direction
6271490 i think its time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether theyve got any policy on this
6271491 all i know is farmers organisations are saying to us ever since we came to government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6271492 this is their practical proposal and weve responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years
6271493 were concerned to know about health checks security checks compliance how we make sure theyre going to go back all of the issues you would expect that surround what is a significant and arguably the most significant change in immigration policy weve had in a generation in australia
6271494 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6271495 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6271496 but i think what brendan is referring to is the checks and balances that go on people coming into the country
6271497 we dont want to for instance import the crime problem of port moresby into australia weve got to make sure the checks and balances are correct
6271498 there was a concern of this sort of image of bringing in labour which is essentially of course to be frank about it non white labour to do jobs that people in australia simply didnt want to do
6271499 they didnt want to have a system in australia where you have a second tier of people who come to our country
6271500 we are going to take a picture of the top and bottom of your teeth and if you help me we can do it fast but if you fight we may be here all day

6271507 when i reached out to the church i felt like i had been condemned because of my lifestyle
6271508 i basically told him in so many words to go to hell
6271509 the church must step forward and clarify it as a disease like any other disease
6271510 if were not willing to tell our members in our churches that being homophobic is a sin then were really shucking and jiving
6271511 in as much as we particularly in our ministry do not encourage unfaithfulness that we call adultery or fornication were not going to change that particular principle
6271512 when we have local agencies to provide testing on sundays after services the numbers of persons actually going in the room and getting tested have been very low
6271513 a recent study by the university of pennsylvanias national annenberg election survey which said young viewers of

6271531 everybodys quick to say oh its oak hill kids those oak hill kids
6271532 its just shorthand for were scared and we need someone to blame it on
6271533 being behind in school contributes to being marginalized which contributes to not showing up which contributes to delinquency
6271534 now you put a bunch of 17 year olds into a ninth grade in a high school where they hardly know anyone else and whats going to happen they could invite each other to a prayer group but thats not typical in my experience
6271535 growing up it wasnt like i was ashamed but we knew it was different here
6271536 i knew i was different because my clothes smelled like kerosene
6271537 we used it for dances and church events bingo game night weight watchers classes

6271541 he blessed us and i saw the grace and power in the blue eyes he had and it was just captivating i never saw eyes that warm and welcoming
6271542 youthful vitality a pope who skied a pope who ran
6271543 someone who isnt the dogmatic strict theologian people think he is hes someone whose central message is that we have to have hope
6271544 certainly you have a diversity and open mindedness on those campuses and some people would question how strict a catholicism those schools have
6271545 but this pope is realistic that youre not going to make people come to your view without a dialogue and im comfortable that the schools my children go to challenge students to question their faith
6271546 my college student children are not in the same church im in on sunday mornings
6271547 so im fine with gay and lesbian student groups on campus and strong debates about controversial issues the world has grown to question things people are not going to just follow anymore
6271548 we simply dont have the resources to keep all those schools open
6271549 these schools will not have the same strength as they would as a catholic school
6271550 when based on a faith conviction you can accomplish so much more than you can in a system that excludes the relationship with god
6271551 if the alternative is a failing public school then isnt the charter school the better
6271552 all students will demonstrate the aptitude attitude and skills to lead responsible fulfilling and respectful lives
6271553 ranged from a low near 80 percent for black and special education students to about 95 percent for asian and white students
6271554 i agree that our role especially for kids caught on the wrong side of the tracks is to fill in gaps left in the home
6271555 what i dont think is wise is reporting data by race on having good character if theres ever a place where teaching to everybody will raise all ships its in teaching character we should be teaching fair play and a moral compass to every child
6271556 we responded to the community outcry many of performers who work with us as well as the community expressed concern about this band
6271557 we want macs to be a place for everyone to fell comfortable at
6271558 i think that was out of line the way they put chucks number out there that was over the line
6271559 i can see how this would be an issue for some one who is suffering under oppression and this is bringing in more of this
6271560 i interepted it the songs as when you are a kid and when you are eating dinner and your mom says dont leave that food there there are starving kids in the world its a satrical look
6271561 i respect their right to protest i dont agree with them they are protesting lyrics written in 1987
6271562 it would be difficult to discuss national targets for ghg gas reductions before the next us administration is in place
6271563 the reluctance against the sectoral approach has a more political origin and a substantive one
6271564 we have to see if that is something that can be captured as a sectoral approach under the un convention
6271565 why should a un official be commenting on what india should commit to or not or possible outcomes earlier too at bali in december key developing countries had complained about a bias in the secretariat
6271566 there is a special place in hell for women who dont support women
6271567 so christ having been offered once to bear the sins of many will appear a second time not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him
6271568 o jerusalem jerusalem the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it
6271569 if jesus is the messiah and jerusalem is denounced and desolate then where will jesus rule
6271570 but when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies then know that its desolation has come near
6271571 theres no place id rather be than here with you guys right now
6271572 we look at all acquisitions going forward but i think thereality is that were not planning any large acquisitions overthe next six months but at the same time we do look ateverything
6271573 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
6271574 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
6271575 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6271576 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard
6271577 if i try to make a life that defies the diminishments of autumn the life i end up with will be artificial at best and utterly colorless as well but when i yield to the endless interplay of living and dying dying and living the life i am given will be real and colorful fruitful and whole

6271595 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6271596 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6271597 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home
6271598 ms johnson has medicaid and could go anywhere but shed rather come to us because of the service we provide

6271601 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
6271602 the idea that anyone could con her doesnt seem right to me
6271603 i think the handwriting on the postcard ive seen isnt the same as lindas handwriting
6271604 i have dealt with a lot of artists she wasnt a flaky artist she wasnt anything like that she was very quick about sending stuff she was very excited to be doing the work
6271605 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6271606 stephanie tubbs jones was a gifted trailblazer with a spirit as big as the city she loved
6271607 when you lose big games like that youre angry at yourself because when you wear the u s jersey a lot is expected youre supposed to win gold medals to miss out on even an opportunity to do that was very disappointing
6271608 its what fuels us i know not all of this team was there but everybody else watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game and i think were a much better team now
6271609 the good news is were getting some rain in some locations
6271610 that allowed us to get out to fires we hadnt gotten to previously
6271611 the men and women of the oregon state police officers association have seen jeff merkley go to bat for law enforcement
6271612 this endorsement demonstrates their belief that he will do what it takes to protect our kids and families
6271613 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6271614 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6271615 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6271616 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6271617 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6271618 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6271619 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6271620 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6271621 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6271622 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6271623 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6271624 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6271625 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6271626 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6271627 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6271628 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track

6271655 watch listing and identification checking are like posting a most wanted list at a post office and then
6271656 there was nothing in the assignment and nothing in ms zlotnicks legal dilemma that should have caused mr aretakis to hijack her litigation for his own personal reasons
6271657 furthermore this decision serves as a written warning that the court will not tolerate sanctionable conduct by mr aretakis in any future litigation before this court
6271658 our country was founded on principles involving freedom of speech and the opportunity to criticize public officials
6271659 this decision should be read in its entirety by every lawyer or citizen who cherishes these fundamental rights it is a historical fact that over the decades that politicians law enforcement and the courts have helped the catholic church avoid our criminal and civil courts and responsibility for their priests having sex with our children
6271660 in my opinion this judge is attempting to punish me and attack my credibility for my extensive efforts as one of two lawyers in the state of new york who have effectively exposed these issues
6271661 congratulations why dont you run for the senate or president of the united states and do something about it
6271662 i t is absolutely improper for a trained lawyer to file a bogus federal law suit in an effort to vent about his personal dissatisfaction with government
6271663 the court has already recited the scurrilous allegations concerning sex abuse the identification of specific priests as sexual predators and other sundry allegations that have absolutely nothing to do with this lawsuit including an ad hominem attack on defense counsel

6271666 myspace has generated most of the law in this area
6271667 do these lawsuits work in the sense of recovering monetary awards only occasionally
6271668 i think more important to these companies is the chilling effect it has on spam
6271669 its essentially letting the world know youre tough about this and creating some deterrents
6271670 i would say that my hope is that publicity from some of the recent large judgments would discourage people from this type of behavior
6271671 the reality is that people who do this at a large scale are making a lot of money and you can potentially collect
6271672 these are very sophisticated business people we represent em so we know
6271673 theyve made a conscious decision that they are better off not fighting it than fighting it its a very common strategy

6271692 to him who from evil is able to bring forth good we render thanks for having mercifully inspired you to make fitting reparation for the losses and wrongs inflicted upon the church for you have both accepted the form of reparation which had been prepared after much consideration and you have also put your person and territory under apostolic suzerainty by right of lordship making over in perpetuity to the holy roman church your kingdoms of england and ireland to be held through the church and of the church subject to an annual payment of 700 marks for england and 300 marks for ireland as is more fully and explicitly contained in your legally framed charter
6271693 you now hold your kingdoms by a more exalted and surer title than before for the kingdom is become a royal priesthood and the priesthood a kingdom of priests as stated by peter in the epistle and moses in the law come then exalted prince fulfil the promises given and confirm the concessions offered so that god almighty may ever fulfil any righteous desire of yours and confirm any honorable purpose enabling you so to walk amid temporal blessings as not to fail of winning the eternal
6271694 the aforesaid legate having full knowledge of our mind will instruct and reassure you as to our good pleasure
6271695 and manifestly grateful in that to make full amends for your sins you have offered yourself and your property to god and the church
6271696 innocent bishop servant of the servants of god to his well beloved son in christ john illustrious king of the english and to his legitimate free born heirs for ever
6271697 the king of kings and lord of lords jesus christ a priest for ever after the order of melchisedech has so established in the church his kingdom and his priesthood that the one is a kingdom of priests and the other a royal priesthood as is testified by moses in the law and by peter in his epistle and over all he has set one whom he has appointed as his vicar on earth so that as every knee is bowed to jesus of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth so all men should obey his vicar and strive that there may be one fold and one shepherd
6271698 such complete amends that he not only paid compensation for losses and restored property wrongfully seized but also conferred full liberty on the english church and further on the relaxation of the two sentences he yielded his kingdom of england and of ireland to st peter and the roman church and received it from us again as fief under an annual payment of one thousand marks having sworn an oath of fealty to us as is clearly stated in his privilege furnished with a golden seal
6271699 for we in our letters and we equally through the archbishop and bishops have asked and advised the king enjoining it on him as he hopes to have his sins remitted to treat these magnates and nobles kindly and to hear their just petitions graciously so that they too might recognize with gladness how by divine grace he had had a change of heart and that thereby they and their heirs should serve him and his heirs readily and loyally and we also asked him to grant them full safe conduct for the outward and homeward journey and the time between so that if they could not arrive at agreement the dispute might be decided in his court by their peers according to the laws and customs of the kingdom but before the envoys bearing this wise and just mandate and reached england the barons threw over their oath of fealty and through even if the king had wrongfully oppressed them they should not have proceeded against him by constituting themselves both judges and executors of the judgement in their own suit yet openly conspiring as vassals against their lord and as knights against their king they leagued themselves with his acknowledged enemies as well as with others and dared to make war on him occupying and devastating his territory and even seizing the city of london the capital of the kingdom which had been treacherously surrendered to them meantime the aforesaid envoys returned to england and the king offered in accordance with the terms of our mandate to grant the barons full justice this they altogether rejected and began to stretch forth their hands to deeds still worse so the king appealing to our tribunal offered to grant them justice before us to whom the decision of this suit belonged by reason of our lordship but this they utterly rejected then he offered that four discreet men chosen by him and four more chosen by themselves should together with us end the dispute and he promised that first in his reforms he would repeal all abuses introduced into england in his reign but this also they contemptuously refused finally the king declared to them that since the lordship of the kingdom belonged to the roman church he neither could nor should without our special mandate make any change in it to our prejudice and so he again appealed to our tribunal placing under apostolic protection both himself and his kingdom with all his honour and rights but making no progress by any method he asked the archbishop and the bishops to execute our mandate to defend the rights of the roman church and to protect himself in accordance with the form of the privilege granted to crusaders when the archbishop and bishops would not take any action seeing himself bereft of almost all counsel and help he did not dare to refuse what the barons had dared to demand and so by such violence and fear as might affect the most courageous of men he was forced to demeaning but also illegal and unjust thereby lessening unduly and impairing his royal rights and dignity we refuse to ignore such shameless presumption for thereby the apostolic see would be dishonoured the kings rights injured the english nation shamed and the whole plan for a crusade seriously endangered and as this danger would be imminent if concessions thus extorted from a great prince who has taken the cross were not cancelled by our authority even though he himself should prefer them to be upheld on behalf of almighty god father son and holy spirit and by the authority of ss peter and paul his apostles and by our own authority acting on the general advice of our brethren we utterly reject and condemn this settlement and under threat of excommunication we order that the king should not dare to observe it and that the barons and their associates should not require it to be observed the charter with all undertakings and guarantees whether confirming it or resulting from it we declare to be null and void of all validity for ever wherefore let no man deem it lawful to infringe this document of our annulment and prohibition or presume to oppose it if anyone should presume to do so let him know that he will incur the anger of almighty god and of ss peter and paul his
6271700 barons until the sunday after easter on the pretext that their demands were too complex for immediate decision
6271701 unlawful and unjust as it is base and shameful whereby the apostolic see is brought into contempt the royal prerogative diminished the english outraged and the whole enterprise of the crusade greatly imperiled
6271702 the king had been compelled to enter upon it by force and fear
6271703 as they had no fixed place of abode baldwin ii king of jerusalem gave them a residence within the precincts of his own place on mount moriah near the church known as the temple of solomon while the clergy of the temple inspired by his example added ground for the erection of necessary offices and other benefactors supplied the means of maintaining the knights in food and clothing from their sacrifice of all worldly advantage and this the first place of their settlement they became known as the poor fellow soldiers of christ and the temple of solomon pauperes commilitones christi et templi salomonis thus was founded in 1118 the famous brotherhood of soldier monks the knights of the temple at first their progress was slow few joined them in their seemingly inglorious toil at the end of nine years they had obtained seven recruits then however the saintly bernard of clairvaux lent them the aid of his powerful advocacy and drew up for their guidance rules of conduct soon embodied and drew up their guidance rules of conduct soon embodied in the more elaborate code which receive the sanction of the council of troyes 1128 by pope honorius ii they were given a distinctive habit in a white mantile symbolical of purity and innocence to which twenty years later pope engenius iii added the red cross seal and badge of martydom thus proclaiming by the sign they bore the dedication of their lives to the defence of pilgrims and the holy land
6271704 by the famous bull omne datum optimum first published in 1162 and a second time ten years later pope alexander iii raised the order to a position of extraordinary privilege and rendered them immune from all jurisdiction lay or ecclesiastical other than that of the holy see thus the templars became independent of all control save that of the supreme pontiff and as proceedings of their chapters were secret virtually a sealed book to the rest of the catholic church the admission of priests however did not place them on a footing of equality with the lay brethren to whom were reserved all the powers of government further only a knight who had taken the vows of the order could hold the office of grand master and to the vows of the order could hold the office of grand master and to the grand master all the members were bound by their vows to render implicit obedience in the church at large authority lay with the priest only he could bind and loose could pronounce the dread sentence of excommunication and grant deliverance from it by absolution this was the power by which in the middle ages the church was able to lay a restraining hand on the most licentious rulers and even to shake the thrones of kings
6271705 the estates of the order were managed in the interests of the common object the defense of christianity in the east and the revenues they yielded devoted to that purpose they formed a network over christendom and the means of communication this elaborate organization afforded led to the templars becoming the financial agents of the crusaders and later the bankers of kings and princes from the first the knights in england were closely associated with the royal court and the prestige this connection gave the order no doubt often induced them to undertake duties not contemplated by their pious founders as laymen yet invested with ecclesiastical sanctity and a power within the kingdom though not of it their counsel was frequently sought by embarrassed rulers often at issue with rebellious subjects in the rude age in which they flourished thus the new temple became a recognized center of meeting and conference in great affairs of church and state bound to the popes by a peculiar allegiance the hospitality of the templars was often extended to foreign prelates and other officers of the mediaeval church who visited england on the business of the holy see the master of the temple ranked as one of the magnates of the realm and successive kings made use of his services as envoy in the conduct of negotiations with other princes
6271706 these relate chiefly to the kings business but there can be no doubt that in multitudes of other private cases of which there is now no record the same thing was going on moreover from a very early date the crown made use of the services of templars as royal agents in the collection of monies payable under subsidies granted the king by the magnates lay and ecclesiastical thus in 1188 henry ii appointed gilbert de ogrestan a brother of the temple with others to collect the tenth known as the saladin tithe believed to be the first tax levied upon personal property in england it is manifest also that the knights carried on a regular business of foreign exchange and constantly undertook in consideration of money paid to them at the new temple to discharge abroad debts owing to foreign creditors by persons resident in england further the new temple is frequently named as the place where money borrowed or a debt otherwise arising is to be paid or discharged by the second and third dated respectively january 1st and 4th 1214 a sum of 6000 marks was ordered to be paid from the temple treasury to pandulph the papal legate and another sum of 1000 marks to the same person together with thomas de erdington and almeric de sacy in the following year john paid to the master of the temple 1100 marks which he had borrowed from the order to enable him to bring troops to england from ponthieu
6271707 further gifts still continued to be showered on the order as late as april 1303 license was granted the templars to hold lands in mortmain received from six different grantees
6271708 the most important of all the military orders both for the extent of its area and for its duration it is said to have existed before the crusades and is not extinct at the present time during this long career it has not always borne the same name known as hospitallers of jerusalem until 1309 the members were called knights of rhodes from 1309 till 1522 and have been called knights of malta since 1530
6271709 in england edward iii in memory of the legendary knights of the round table established in 1349 brotherhood of twenty five knights exclusive of princes of the blood and foreign princes with st george as its patron and with its chapel in windsor castle for the holding of chapters this the order of the garter takes its name from the characteristic badge won on the left knee the choice of this badge has given rise to various anecdotes of doubtful authenticity nothing is now known of the original object of the order of the bath the creation of which dates from the coronation of henry iv 1399 a third order scottish by origin is that of the order of the thistle dating from the reign of james v of scotland 1534 these orders still exist though they have been protestantized
6271710 the knights of the great orders were regarded in the church as analogous to monks whose three vows they professed and whose immunities they shared they were answerable to the pope alone they had their chapels their clerics and their cemeteries all exempted from the jurisdiction of the secular clergy their landed property was free from tithes they were not subject to the interdicts which the bishops in those days employed so freely they did not all follow the same monastic rule the templars and orders derived from them followed the cistercian reform the hospitallers followed the rule of st augustine nevertheless in consequence of the relaxation which manifested itself among them after the period of the crusades the holy see introduced mitigations in favour of the non clerical brethren for these it was difficult to maintain the rule of celibacy in all its rigour they were permitted in certain orders to marry once and that only with a maiden even where second marriages were tolerated they had to vow conjugal fidelity so that if they violated this obligation of the natural law they sinned doubly against the law and against their vow besides the three vows the rule bound the brethren to the exercises of the monastic life such as the recitation of the hours for which in the case of illiterates a fixed number of paters was substituted it also prescribed their dress and their food and their feast abstinence and fast days lastly the rule imposed detailed obligations in regard to the election of dignitaries and the admission of members to the two ranks of combatants knights and men at arms and the two of non combatants chaplains to whom all sacerdotal functions were reserved and casaliers or tenants who were charged with the management of temporal affairs
6271711 the military organization of the orders was uniform explained by that law of war which compels the belligerent to maintain his military apparatus on a level with those of his adversary on pain of defeat the strength of an army was in its cavalry and to this type the armament mounting and tactics of the military orders conformed the knights brethren were the heavy cavalry the men at arms brethren the light cavalry the former were entitled to three horses a piece the latter had to be content with one among the former only knights of tried prowess were admitted or in default of this qualification sons of knights because in such families the warlike spirit and military training were hereditary the consequence was that the knights properly so called were never very numerous they formed a corps dlite which carried the great mass of the crusaders gathered in convents which were also barracks combining with the passive obedience of the soldier the spontaneous submission of the religious living shoulder to shoulder in brotherly union commander and subordinate these orders surpassed in that cohesiveness which is the ideal of every military organization the most famous bodies of picked soldiery known to history from the macedonian phalanx to the ottoman janissaries
6271712 the importance acquired by the military orders during the course of the middle ages may be measured by the extent of their territorial possessions scattered throughout europe in the thirteenth century nine thousand manors formed the portion of the templars thirteen thousand that of the hospitallers these temporalities were an integral part of the ecclesiastical domain and as such had a sacred character which placed them beyond liability to profane uses or to secular imposts they differed from the temporalities of other monastic institutions only in the centralized system of their administration while within each of the other religious institutes every abbey was autonomous all the houses of a military order were bound to contribute their revenues after deducting expenses to a central treasury as a result of this enormous circulation of capital controlled by the orders their wealth could be applied to financial operations which made them veritable credit and deposit banks their perfect good faith earned for them the implicit confidence of the church and of temporal rulers the papacy employed them to collect contributions for the crusades princes did not hesitate to entrust to them their personal property in this respect again the military orders were model institutions
6271713 the temple church was built by the knights templars in the twelfth century it is the third oldest church in london and in it the knights templars were accused of performing some very strange pagan rites in the great fire of 1666 the temple church barely escaped
6271714 at this time the occupant of the papal throne was bertrand de got formerly archbishop of bordeaux and now known as pope clement v he had moved the papacy to avigonon and was a puppet in the hands of the french king to whose influence he owed his elevation to the pontificate philip iv surnamed le bel now ruled france a prince whose handsome exterior veiled a nature essentially false and cruel with revenues depleted by his flemish wars he turned a greedy eye on the wealth of the templars exactly when and how the plot between philip and his subservient pope was first hatched has not been disclosed but it is certain that while still professing publicly the most friendly feelings towards the order he was secretly planning their destruction
6271715 when the vicar of christ himself entered the witness box scepticism was silenced
6271716 the articles of accusation sent by the pope numbered eighty seven
6271717 meanwhile under the merciless direction of king philip and his inquisitors the tragedy had been pursuing its cruel course in france there those brethren who did not confess were condemned to perpetual imprisonment while those who admitted the charges and did not afterwards withdraw their admissions were for the most part absolved and set at liberty others who ashamed of their weakness under torture subsequently retracted their confessions of guilt and claimed to defend the order were seized by philips command and burnt as relapsed heretics fifty four so suffered at paris in one day their firmness in adhering to their retractations notwithstanding the terrible consequences and the intrepidity with which they endured a cruel death astonished all beholders and point with overwhelming force to the falsity of the charges laid against them
6271718 the fate of james de molay the grand master of the temple and some of his superior officers still remained undecided with molay geoffrey de charnis preceptor of normandy and two other knights of high position hugh de peraud visitor of france and godfrey de gonnville preceptor of aquitaine were arraigned before this tribunal the two latter abode by their former confessions and were sentenced to perpetual imprisonment but the grand master and geoffrey de charnis to the astonishment of their judges seized the opportunity to publicly declare that they were innocent of the charges laid against them that the confessions they had made to save their own lives were false and that the order was pure and holy unprepared for such an emergency and at a loss what course to pursue the commissioners adjourned without pronouncing any judgement subject only to ecclesiastical law the knights were not amenable to any lay jurisdiction till sentenced by a spiritual court but contemptuously indifferent to papal sanction king philip did not wait calling his counsellors together he forthwith passed sentence of death and at dusk of the same day march 18th 1313 the grand master and his undaunted companion were taken by royal officers to an island in the seine and protesting their innocence to the last slowly burnt to death it is said that in his final agony molay summoned pope and king to meet him within a year before that tribunal where judgment does not err the story may be an ex post facto invention to be explained rather by a popular belief in the innocence of the victims than by any circumstance which actually occurred but be that as it may in the events which followed many believed they beheld the retribution of divine wrath in little more than a month the venal pontiff glutted with ill gotten gain wealth was smitten by a foul disease and passed to his account while on the 29th of the following november king philip still in middle life was called from the enjoyment of his plunder to answer for the wrongs he had committed he expired at fontainbleau the victim of a mysterious malady which baffled all medical skill
6271719 the severance from rome and the confiscation of the monastic estates in england which were carried out by henry viii were accompanied by one change which intimately concerned the two legal societies of the temple
6271720 the turning of the tide for robert the bruce scotland and the knights templar was the famous battle of bannockburn which took place on june 24 1324 on june 24 of 1324 robert the bruce of scotland with approximately 6 000 scots miraculously defeated 20 000 english soldiers exactly what took place has never really been recorded it is believed by some that bruce did it with the help of a special force of knights templar after all june 24 was also a special day to the knights templar it was st johns day after a day of combat which had left both english and scottish armies exhausted panic swept the english ranks king edward together with 500 of his knights abruptly fled the field demoralized the english foot soldiers promptly followed suit and the withdrawal deteriorated quickly into a full scale rout the entire english army abandoning their supplies their baggage their money their gold and silver plate their arms armour and equipment
6271721 the great king robert the bruce supported by the knights templar led by sir william sinclair with an army of only 9 000 defeated 38 000 englishmen the scots facing heavy cavalry archers and wave upon wave of staunch and brave englishmen on that day it was the crushing charge of the knights templar across rocky and almost impassable ground that turned the tide of victory that far off day almost seven hundred years ago they won for scotland her independence sir robert keith commanded the light cavalry whilst the knights templar were led by sir william sinclair
6271722 the first templar to be initiated in the united states was william davis who was given thhe degrees of excellent supe excellent royal arch and knight templar by the st
6271723 all knights templar are members of the worlds oldest fraternal organization known as
6271724 that of the templars was purely military form the beginning and on this point it can claim priority despite the contrary assertions of the hospitallers the templars followed a different monastic rule and wore a different habit the white habit of the cistercians whose rule they followed with a red cross while the hospitallers had the black mantle with a white cross in war the knightly brothers wore above their armour a red surcoat with the white cross mutually emulous from the outset they soon became rivals and this rivalry had much to do with the rapid decline of the kingdom of jerusalem in other respects the two orders held the same rank in church and state both being recognized as regular orders and endowed by the papacy with most extensive privileges absolute independence of all spiritual and temporal authority save that of rome exemptions from tithes with the right to have their own chapels clergy and cemeteries the name knights then prevailed over that of hospitallers this character was accentuated by the fusion of the hospitallers with the remaining knights templars subsequent to the suppression of the latter 1312 this fusion at the same time increased the wealth of the order to which the pope assigned the property of the templars in every country except aragon and portugal
6271725 all of the flags used in the colonies were military flags
6271726 the flag mentioned by admiral preble that was unfurled by general washington at his camp at cambridge is called the grand union flag
6271727 the grand union flag was nothing more than an adaptation of the british red ensign also known as the meteor flag the only difference being that instead of being entirely red it contained thirteen horizontal red and white stripes like the modern day american ensign the statement is made that it was designed by a committee appointed by congress for that purpose but the committee referred to was appointed to confer with general washington and others for the purpose of devising means for organizing and maintaining an army and neither does their official report nor correspondence show that they even considered the question of a flag it was not long after their return to philadelphia when on january 1 1776 there was hoisted over general washingtons headquarters on prospect hill at somerville near cambridge a flag having thirteen horizontal red and white stripes and in the canton was the union jack complying with the act of 1707 requiring that it be on all flags banners standards and ensigns whether used on land or at sea it was merely the british marine flag of that day with the solid red field divided by white ribbons so as to make thirteen red and white stripes representing the thirteen revolting colonies at that time the idea of independence was not generally seriously considered so that the union jack in this flag showed the allegiance of the colonies to their mother country the flag itself was immediately appropriated by the navy for our continental fleet under admiral hopkins carried it as a national ensign early in february if not in january 1776 and although our army used it over fortifications and barracks they did not carry it in battle with the growth of the idea of independence the colonists apparently conceived a dislike for the union jack in the flag for after 1776 i have found no definite instance of its use by our revolutionary patriots
6271728 prior to the declaration of independence the different colonies retained the standards of the mother country the ancient national flag of england a white banner with the red cross of st george or the union flag of king james a combination of the crosses of st george and st andrew designated as the king s colors
6271729 on january 2 1776 at cambridge in the presence of the military with the assistance of his officers and with appropriate ceremonies in which the franklin committee were participants general washington with his own hands hoisted the newly accepted and newly made banner upon a towering and specially raised pine tree liberty pole thus unfurling to the breeze and displaying to his army the citizens of the vicinity and the british forces in boston for the first time the new and officially recognized confederated colonial flag
6271730 for nearly seventy years before the revolutionary war broke out the red ensign of great britain was generally adopted by the american colonies it was called the union flag because in the upper corner next to the staff which is called the canton were the red cross of st george representing england and the white cross representing scotland the combination of these crosses which indicated a union character was prescribed in 1707 while the colonists were not lacking in devotion to the british ensign in pre revolutionary times they nevertheless took occasion to place some particular device upon it applicable to the individual colony to which it belonged
6271731 the declaration of independence at philadelphia on july 4 1776 transformed the hitherto british colonies into independent states changed the colonial congress into as nearly a continental legislature as under the circumstances it could become and made john hancock the representative p
6271732 from 1707 on the union flag and the red ensign or meteor flag were borne by both merchant marine and the royal navy on land they floated over the forts and followed the marching armies they waved too over remote wilderness posts and over the forest threading brigades of the fur trader thus the flag of britain was the colonists flag endeared to them by ancient association and by the endurance of common hazards and triumphs in uncounted campaigns and battles quaife p 35
6271733 with this practice of nations then before them and evidently applied by them viz that of applying some badge of distinction in use in their armies to their national banner combined with that of indicating different portions of their armies by different colors for their flags and of two nations when uniting adopting as a common ensign something to indicate their union and still preserve the original banners both as to devices and color under which they had respectively achieved signal triumphs especially as this last example was that of the mother country we may expect to see the colonies carrying out this practice in their union flag they were british colonies and as we have p 69 shown they used the british union but now they were to distinguish their flag by its color from other british ensigns preserve a trace of the colors under which they had previously fought with success and at the same time represent this combination in some form peculiar to themselves the mode of distinction by color could not well be applied by the united colonies in a single color as the simpler and most striking were exhausted in application to british ensigns but if applied must have been used in a complex form or combination of colors this being the case stripes of color would naturally be suggested as being striking as enabling them to show the number and union of the colonies as preserving the colors of the flags previously used by them and also the badge of distinction which at the time of the adoption of this flag marked the different grades in the un uniformed army before boston hence probably the name the great union flag given to it by the writer in the philadelphia gazette before quoted doubtless colonel joseph reed inasmuch as this flag indicated as respected the colonies precisely what the grand union flag of great britain indicated respecting the mother country
6271734 this idea became an accomplished fact upon the inauguration of the new government in 1789
6271735 resolved that the flag of the thirteen united states be thirteen stripes alternate red and white and that the union be thirteen stars white in a blue field representing a new constellation
6271736 we cannot escape more or less difficulty when we search for light as to who designed and manufactured the first flag bearing the stars and stripes the popular story bestows the honor upon mrs betsy ross it is alleged that congress appointed a committee composed of general washington robert morris and george ross to design a flag these gentlemen called upon mrs ross in the month of may or june 1776 and commissioned her to make the first flag with thirteen stars to harmonize with the thirteen stripes which had been placed on the standard raised at cambridge six months previous
6271737 one of the most famous events involving the flag in colonial times was the case of john endicott who removed the cross from the flag because he believed it to be a symbol of popery a sentiment felt by many in the colonies in november 1634 complaint was recorded that john p 15 endicott had defaced the english ensign at salem by cutting out with his sword a part of the red cross in the flag that hung before the governor s gate declaring that it savored of popery and he would have none of it he was a member of the court assistants but for this insult to the kings colors he was reprimanded removed from his office and disqualified to hold any public office for the space of one year in this sentiment that his violent act indicated endicott was not without sympathizers and soon after some of the militia refused to march under the symbol that was to them idolatrous after a grave controversy which was not concluded until some time in december 1635 when the military commissioners appointed colors for every company leaving out the red cross in all of them it was agreed that the kings colors should fly from ships and be displayed over castle island boston because the castle belonged to the king and this flag continued in use there until the establishment of the commonwealth under cromwell in 1651 when the english parliament revived and adopted the old standard of the cross of st george as the colors of england the general court of massachusetts adopted this order as the court conceive the old english colors now used by the parliament to be a necessary badge of distinction betwixt the english and other nations in all places of the world till the state of england alter the same which we very much desire we being of the same nation have therefore ordered that the captain of the castle shall advance the aforesaid colors of england upon all necessary occasions

6271739 this provides the new nation at its birth with a myth to sustain it
6271740 the temple has close historical associations with the american republic five of the signers of the declaration of independence were members of the middle temple edward rutledge thomas hayward thomas mckean thomas lynch and arthur middleton besides these george rutledge william livingstone john dickinson of pennsylvania and arthur lee of virginia and payton randolph president of the continental congress of philadelphia were all members of the inn it all began with the knights templars who in the days of their power and pride formed a highly privileged order they governed within their territory according to their own laws without interference from any outside authority when the lawyers took over the property they inherited or assumed the like privilege and independence a position that they have stoutly and resolutely and successfully maintained until the present day
6271741 the attack upon the order which became general on the continent was not shared in england but when the dissolution was pronounced by the council of bienna in 1312 the properties passed to the knights hospitallers in london however that order did not take full possession of the temple when the knights templars were disbanded the three parts of the properties lying contiguous to each other were called the inner the middle and the outer temple according to the relation of each to the city the knights hospitallers were allowed to occupy the inner which included the more sacred parts the outer was granted by the king to the bishop of exeter and was eventually acquired by robert devereux earl of essex and with essex house became the seat of that ill fated nobleman there he surrendered to the officers of elizabeth and thence he proceeded to his trial and execution the properties continued in private hands and so the outer extending from the strand to the river along both sides of essex street within a few years of their occupation of the inner temple the knights hospitallers were in possession of the middle as well and we find them renting parts of the inner to a certain company of lawyers and the middle to another company of lawyers the rent paid in each instance being ten pounds annually it was therefore early in the fourteenth century that the lawyers got their first footing in the temple and from the first they appear to have formed two distinct societies on in the inner temple and the other in the middle temple
6271742 the temple has not been spared the calamities that have been visited upon london one occurred during the peasants revolt in 1381 under wat tyler the peasants who regarded the lawyers with special aversion moved in a mob to the temple with the avowed purpose of hanging its inhabitants the lawyers having got wind of the plan had business elsewhere on that day the rebels however plundered the houses some of which they destroyed and made a bonfire of all books and records till the dissolution the knights hospitallers remained the owners of the temple receiving rents from the two societies of lawyers that order was dissolved by henry viii who confiscated the property and allowed the lawyers to remain as tenants of the crown at an annual rental of ten pounds a year for each of the two societies it seems that henry had a scheme for turning out the lawyers and converting the temple into some use of his own devising but it also seems that the lawyers were too smart even for henry and managed somehow to retain the properties at the same rent that they had been paying for over two hundred years the only difference being that the crown became their landlord in 1608 james the first made an effort to deprive the lawyers of the premises by effecting a sale again they scored this time by presenting the king with a gold cup weighing two hundred ounces filled with gold pieces in exchange for a charter granting them the temple forever at the old annual rental of ten pounds a year for each society in 1673 however the two societies together purchased these rents from charles ii and became the absolute owners forever the one of the inner temple and the other of the middle temple thus the temple premises the heritage of an ancient order of chivalry identified with the crusades became the permanent property of the lawyers who have been in continuous occupation since 1412 and whose present title is base on the rental of 10 pounds which each of the two societies paid at that time for its share as tenant in no instance does the persistence of custom in the city of london show to better advantage with deeper meaning or with greater honour thaan in this temple of law wher students come from all over the british empire to gain admission to the bar always there have been four inns of court the middle temple the inner temple lincolns inn and grays inn the last two lying outside the temple precincts in holborn they are the only power in england that can admit to the bar
6271743 i know of no event that presaged the founding of the empire overseas like the arrival of the golden hinde at london it was the most colossal and most daring propaganda that ever encompassed the earth from that time on the londoners developed and fostered the colonizing spirit and from the time that englishmen got a foothold in america the plantations were nourished and powerfully supported by london merchants virginia was founded by the city of london and the city companies together among the leaders in the new world were men learned in the law who had lived at the inns of court and sat with the benchers in the temple not the law alone but the customs the traditions the faiths of london penetrated the thirteen colonies whatever difference of opinion there might have been in the colonies about the policies of the government there was none in london right or wrong these policies were opposed by londoners from the beginning the lord mayor and aldermen as spokesmen for the city sent on remonstrance after another to the king on the throne till incensed at their persistence he informed their representative in parliament that he would receive on the throne no more communications from the lord mayor this was a denial of one of londons ancient rights the lord mayor promptly reminded him that londons right of making representations to the king on the throne had never been challenged the king acknowledged the right the lord mayor and aldermen continued to send their remonstrances against the colonial policy of government they were no perfunctory warnings that the city sent to the throne
6271744 the royal palace and the seat of the carmelite brothers lay therefore between ludgate and the temple and between fleet street and the thames lying outside the wall but inside the city they had temple bar as an outer protection temple bar is at least as old as the temple whence it derived the name by which it has been known to history

6271789 despite the new name the general lessening of totally off the wall speculation far fetched animal analogies to very distantly related species and the avoidance of grossly sexist remarks evolutionary psychologists present the same theories as the sociobiologists central to the work of most of them is the genic selection theory claims that genes not organisms are selected it is most well known as selfish gene theory in popularizations by richard dawkins this doctrine genic selectionism has been criticized by biologists such as gould and lewontin but many journeyman biologists accept the theory even attributing the details of the theory to dawkins himself when he was only popularizing certain trends in genetics and theories of hamilton and others the debates concerning evolutionary psychology have revived the debate about genic selectionism part of the debate concerns whether genes alone are selected as dawkins claims or whether individual organisms and species and perhaps also groups are selected as well

6271792 lewontin gould and some other writers have emphasized against selectionism a number of random and non selective factors in evolution these include 1 purely random recombination 2 genetic drift in which random sampling errors in reproduction change the distribution of genes in a population 3 so called non darwinian evolution which involves the random mutation of the third letter in some dna code words in which two or more words are synonyms which code for the same amino acid and hence the difference in the third letter makes no difference in the resultant organism and is not selected for a significant theory dennett does not even mention 4 structural constraints such as basic body plans which may become far from optimally adaptive but which are too difficult to change by piecemeal natural selection without making many other features of the organism maladaptive 5 geological or astronomical catastrophes such as the asteroid collision causing mass extinctions 6 species selection in which differing rates of extinction and more importantly speciation branching produce more species in some lineages than in others
6271793 there is in dennett a discussion of the naturalistic fallacy in ethics but no further discussion of scientific reduction
6271794 what dennett would have to counter is lewontin and sobers argument that when selection coefficients of genes are context dependent and selection acts on gene complexes the artificially constructed selection coefficients of genes do not play a causal role
6271795 interestingly several of the leading sociobiologists and popularizers of evolutionary psychology such as e o wilson randy thornhill and robert wright hale from alabama one can speculate that the religious fundamentalist atmosphere of the american deep south may have led those who defected to darwin to find in darwinism a cosmic world view answering the same questions that the dominant religious view claimed to answer robert wright 1988 is quite explicit about this
6271796 the notion that human beings have evolved from other animals and are a part of biological nature is tremendously important
6271797 i think that the supporters of senator clinton will have high energy as well because they know at the end of the convention well all have to come out united behind senator obama so that we can win in november
6271798 it will be a very sad thing for the american people because it means people dont have their priorities straight
6271799 the idea is we need to go in a different direction in this country we need change we dont need more of the same if we dont come out united it will be very misguided
6271800 2008 is a political year like none other that i can remember in 30 years that ive spent in politics both the democrats and the republicans nominating somebody that theyre a little unsure about

6271809 the affected employees will be provided with their full entitlements and supported in the transition the decision to reduce our workforce has not been taken lightly and we are mindful of the impact upon individuals their families and the community we firmly believe that this is the best option to ensure continuity of operations and to preserve the mine for the long term benefit of the community and the shareholders

6271820 if the reserve bank of australia rba reduces the official cash rate by 0 25 per cent at its september board meeting nab will reduce its standard variable interest rate by 0 25 per cent to 9 36 per cent per annum
6271821 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6271822 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6271823 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6271824 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6271825 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6271826 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time

6271869 i think the chances are between slim and none that well be getting any money for it
6271870 they wouldnt be getting here if the border wasnt so porous

6271903 not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will
6271904 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics

6271911 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6271917 i believe showing a person how to use a condom and dental dams are more effective then telling them to use it going to a sex shop with your partner can be a great date with this screening i hope that people get that safer sex can be fun i would like to see more couples get tested for hiv aids and stis together

6271921 the bloody date was june 5 2007 karen mies staggering under the news that her son had murdered her husband told a family friend she was grateful for one thing the wounded deputies were alive

6271924 for starters states under pakatan rakyat can reduce the number of gambling premises as gambling is strictly prohibited by all religions
6271925 permits or licences to sell alcohol should either be limited or only allowed for areas inhabited by non muslims and such premises should not be allowed to operate in predominantly muslim areas
6271926 the permits to sell alcohol also should only be given to non muslims as malays are forbidden from consuming alcohol in the first place
6271927 at the end of the day it is up to them to decide whether to reduce or totally ban the sale of alcohol and gambling
6271928 we will hold a meeting first before submitting our views to the party leadership
6271929 should policies that do not promote islam as an agenda are introduced or if it is sidelined obviously we will not be able to cooperate fully with pakatan rakyat

6271948 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6271949 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6271950 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6271951 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6271952 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6271953 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6271954 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6271955 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6271956 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6271957 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6271958 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6271963 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6271964 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6271965 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6271991 those who judge minimalism by its appearance alone will call it spartan austere even soulless but art and design are not just about appearances ornamentation is not art great art is about heightening our experiences to me the minimalist aesthetic is the most humanist of all one that elicits the full power of all our senses
6271992 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
6271993 in some ways its going back to the kind of work i did earlier in my career where i did more of the arms and legs work
6271994 and at ibm there was a long line of people behind me here the line is pretty short
6271995 i may get whats important for me but you have to recognize that what you need is na ve or impractical
6271996 if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches for the creator there is no poverty
6271997 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6271998 he wanted a victory parade in zchinwali and got russian troops marching toward tbilisi
6271999 since we dont have any boy babies in our family
6272000 what use is technical knowledge or facts you learn from books if you dont know how or why to use them
6272001 in a student as practitioner classroom teachers need to be open
6272002 i will ask students to use these components but when the final product comes in it is ultimately up to each student to use the devices appropriate to his or her story
6272003 as long as students are making deliberate decisions about how they want to write i need to let them try it i have been surprised a number of times by students who chose to do something against my advice and ended up with a better final product without my change
6272004 when i tell students they are going to create a podcast of their own stories they get excited
6272005 this buy in from the students gives them a purpose to learn new skills and a reason to come to school
6272006 simple wooden cross hung on a brick wall in the vaulted and sizable sanctuary and
6272007 some would say with marxist momma in the top job its little wonder why barack obama is the dncs golden boy coming to denver with mainstream media garnered rock star status
6272008 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
6272009 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6272010 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6272011 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6272012 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6272013 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6272014 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6272015 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6272016 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6272017 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6272018 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6272019 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6272020 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6272021 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6272022 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6272023 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6272024 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6272025 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area
6272026 during the takeoff there was clearly a problem and the plane fell to the ground
6272027 one of the main strategic goals which he had set himself had been realized
6272028 a very special moment in our common history we have achieved the main goal it means our countries poland and the united states will be more secure
6272029 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6272030 the long range interceptor missiles to be deployed in poland do not have and in the foreseeable future will not have any target other than russian intercontinental ballistic missiles
6272031 it is clear to us and the us leadership does not deny this that the us anti missile defence in europe will be broadened and modernised
6272032 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic steps
6272033 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin

6272038 no apologies for the trips that i have taken during my tenure in congress
6272039 if the russians have it it needs to be returned immediately
6272040 but theres conflicting reports on it right now wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is us equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
6272041 theres some also indications that theyve made that assurance if theyve made that assurance they need to honor that commitment as well

6272046 its time to take a shower hop in the car
6272047 hey mind if me and my kids take a shower here
6272048 the people of georgia seemed to us more relaxed than any we had seen so far relaxed and fierce and full of joy and perhaps this why the russians admire them so perhaps this is the way they would like to be
6272049 californians are in a state of perpetual vacation they dont know about real life
6272050 and surely they live in a country favored by nature and just as surely they have had to fight for it for two thousand years
6272051 they are fiery proud fierce and gay and the other people of russia have great admiration for them and the men are triumphant with the women of russia they are a people of poetry of music and dancing and according to tradition great lovers
6272052 they were dressed in an odd costume short canvas jackets without sleeves and canvas belts and short trunks
6272053 they had the fierce gaiety of the italians and the physical energy of the burgundians their energy not only survives but fattens on a tropical climate and nothing can break their individuality or their spirit that has been tried for many centuries by invaders by czarist armies by despots by the little local nobility
6272054 the table was fourteen feet long and it was loaded with food chicken over which was poured a cold green sauce delicious with spices and sour cream tomato salads and georgian pickles savory stew of lamb with a thick sauce fried country cheese loaves of flat georgian rye bread the table was loaded with fruit with grapes and pears and apples
6272055 if we did not eat we were urged to eat and if we did eat our plates were replenished immediately
6272056 and surely they live in a country favored by nature and just as surely they have had to fight for it for two thousand years
6272057 in any group of say ten men there would be at least seven fine voices
6272058 and this is how it was when we stopped for just a bit to eat and a glass of wine in a georgian farmhouse
6272059 it is a magical place georgia and it becomes dream like the moment you have left it and the people are magic people it is true that they have on of the richest and most beautiful countries in the world and they live up to it and we understood thoroughly now why russians had always said to us

6272061 we have a bold and optimistic vision for lausd that includes the 7 billion bond proposal for november
6272062 we will continue to work with stakeholders teachers parents and advocates to build the school district our students deserve
6272063 i believe that 400 million for charter schools is hugely excessive
6272064 i think that this bond will go down i believe that you are running out of homeowners to pay for public education
6272065 when you ignore your school system for 34 years it will deteriorate
6272066 this vote is the first step in an unprecedented investment in our childrens future
6272067 this bond isnt about slapping another coat of paint on the problem its about fundamentally transforming our district into small safe and independent schools today we have shown parents teachers and students that we are serious about reforming this district as we know it
6272068 we know that this is indeed a burden on our citizens at times but our citizens have made it very clear that what they want is a safe modern school system
6272069 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
6272070 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue
6272071 we need this group of californians to contribute to the economy
6272072 i find it truly unfortunate that we are now 48 days into the new fiscal year and still dont have a spending plan in place
6272073 i believe the democratic budget proposal taken up in sacramento is sound realistic and fair because it depends on a combination of cuts to state programs the infusion of new revenues and structural reforms sought by republicans
6272074 although they dont have a budget proposal of their own our republican colleagues would prefer to only cut and borrow out of this crisis
6272075 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy
6272076 it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
6272077 what we get instead of real reform is phony reform pushed by our democratic friends
6272078 continues to push legislators to pass a bipartisan budget that he can sign
6272079 if you are in nyc and want a xbox 360 elite
6272080 they called to tell me that new programming staff at time warner had erred and would be reimbursing each of its subscribers in lynwood
6272081 the lynwood utility users tax was illegally imposed without a vote of the people the 10 percent tax taxes your telephone gas electric water and cable tv
6272082 the city can educate our citizens but we are not allowed to advocate for the tax
6272083 we dont know exactly what will happen in november but we do know there will be possible ramifications if it doesnt pass
6272084 what we have said that if we lose the utility tax its such a large amount that its going to be tough now to pay the sheriffs and fire departments contracts because together they constitute almost 50 percent of the general fund budget
6272085 the council has already cut more than 4 million from the budget and a number of positions
6272086 if we have to go back to our budget in november if the tax doesnt pass were going to have to go back and review the budget its definitely going to reduce services not police and fire but other services theres just no way around it we are already working on a slim budget
6272087 there is no tax quite as unfair and regressive as the utility tax
6272088 the utiulity tax is a vital element in the funding of critical city services
6272089 the tax is levied by the city collected by the utility as part of its regular billing procedure then remitted to the city statewide city and county utility user taxes generate more than 1 8 billion per year
6272090 it was not illegal lynwood wasnt the only one to adopt the tax and right now were doing what other cities are doing and thats taking it back to the voters
6272091 telling residents that the utility users tax helps to pay for fire and police services is not a scare tactic
6272092 all were doing is educating the public about how the city uses those funds fire and police services may not be affected but services like street sweeping the senior center services and keeping the parks clean could be affected
6272093 we are formalizing a strategy right now doing education presentations before all of our commissions and will be reaching out to neighborhood watch organizations
6272094 residents should know exactly how those funds are used its going to be a multi faceted approach but its important like i said we are walking a fine tightrope here we dont want to advocate which way to vote but we think its necessary and important to inform our residents what its used for
6272095 we go back and forth i dont know if its in our immediate future its something we talk about every few months well know when the time is right if were going to do it if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might

6272098 with this lawsuit were telling the oil company that it cant ignore obligations to the health and safety of the residents of boyle heights
6272099 far too often people who live in low income communities are exposed to environmental hazards that those in more affluent communities are not today the city attorney and i are saying it doesnt matter if you live in boyle heights or brentwood were going to protect you from undue exposure to cancer causing toxins

6272117 i continue to be impressed by the academic achievements of our elementary school students and am pleased with the signs of improvement at the middle school level
6272118 however we still have a great deal of work ahead of us to improve the proficiency and academic performance of our high school students
6272119 while there is much to celebrate in the substantial gains made by all subgroups of students over the last five years we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
6272120 it is good news that all students continue to improve
6272121 it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively compete with their peers
6272122 we already know enough about the inequities we must now invest in the resources these children need to succeed in school and ultimately in the workplace the snails pace of improvement shown by latino students in narrowing the gap in english language arts and mathematics is a tragedy and the complete lack of any progress by african american students is appalling
6272123 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap
6272124 california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers

6272185 the backboard gives you the margin of error you dont have
6272186 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6272187 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt thinks it matters whether american wins or loses
6272188 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job against the taliban
6272189 senator mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6272190 i will be delighted as my wife has agreed to the interview

6272194 how about this you aim the knife at me and ill surrender to you okay
6272195 shes worse shes a mule its very hard to change her mind
6272196 she has a very strong mind and is too opinionated she is by far the more outspoken one between the two of us when shes around i have no chance to talk
6272197 she told me she built this for me so i can have my personal space but it is really so that her mother will have a place to stay when she visits
6272198 i was naive i should have planned my life better but letting go of my daughter was never an option for me
6272199 in any gathering where she is around if you hear laughter it would be coming from her table people invite me only because of her
6272200 it doesnt bother me because i dont care what people think about me she enjoys better exposure because of her personality and thats fine with me
6272201 he listens more than he speaks even when ivy is not around he doesnt talk much
6272202 a lot of things are unimportant to me but on major things like deciding where to live i have a say and the final decision must be based on what i want too
6272203 it was ivys idea to run a farm it was a good idea and i liked it
6272204 ntuc fairprice is my baby i have a sense of ownership towards it and i couldnt possibly just say i resign then leave that would be unfair
6272205 whatever you do do it well that is my principle
6272206 i dont think i can complain life has been good to me
6272207 she wants to be in the drivers seat she says i can have my own opinions but she always ends up making all the decisions sometimes it gets a little irritating
6272208 her position is she knows everything and whatever she says is always right but i tell her there are two sides to a story and you cannot jump to conclusions at the end of the day she still sticks to her own views
6272209 he doesnt tell me what to do as he respects my strong mind and because he knows i wont listen to him anyway

6272216 against all odds a tibetan has once again raised our outlawed national flag in beijing tonight
6272217 this action symbolises the determination and steadfast commitment of the tibetan people and our supporters from around the world to achieve freedom and justice for six million tibetans living under the brutal rule of the chinese government
6272218 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6272219 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people

6272334 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6272335 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6272336 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6272337 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6272338 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6272339 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6272354 according to don mancini i think what we are mainly responding to david kirschner and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy

6272393 what will the next 5 000 days of the web bring
6272394 with the esample center we will be able to offer medication samples to our physicians and their patients through an electronic platform
6272395 this approach will provide both consistent access to medication samples and focus face to face interaction between our physicians and drug company representatives on matters of education we believe this new approach reduces the potential for those interactions to improperly influence care

6272397 we expect a growing number of pharmaceutical companies to participate
6272398 the bats 2 500th sortie is a result of more than four years of outstanding dedication hard work and selflessness on the part of maintainers aircrew and support troops
6272399 the key to the units success has been the synergistic teamwork between the maintenance and operations professionals deployed from the 55th electronic combat group and the 355th maintenance group from davis monthan afb
6272400 this is the most unique deployment i have been on
6272401 both amus are satisfying but the job fulfillment of putting aircraft in the air to capture bad guys and save troops is beyond anything i have ever experienced
6272402 with this added luxury we are confident in each others abilities
6272403 this leads to extremely efficient communication to get the job done
6272404 we provide the best support we can to the troops on the ground and as their focus changes we change
6272405 the mission is highly rewarding because every sortie we launch has the potential to save our troops lives
6272406 i am honored to be part of the war on terrorism and 55th electronic group history

6272447 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6272448 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

6272466 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6272467 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6272468 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6272469 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6272470 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6272471 today we told employees due to economic conditions general motors and navistar have decided not to renew their memorandum of understanding
6272472 continue to review our strategic options with regard to the medium duty truck line which will include conversations with navistar
6272473 due to significant marketplace and economic changes gm and navistar have decided not to renew the memorandum of understanding to purchase gms medium duty truck business
6272474 weve retained the medium duty truck line which we think will be good for flint
6272475 we wanted to retain our work cal rapson uaw international vice president worked hard to maintain that work
6272476 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6272477 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6272478 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6272479 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6272480 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6272481 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6272482 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6272483 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6272484 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6272485 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6272486 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6272487 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6272488 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6272489 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6272490 if youre flying on an aa 767 200 from nyc to san francisco miami or los angeles you can kick the tires of americans new gogo aircell in flight wi fi service for 12 95 the rate for flights over 3 hours
6272491 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6272492 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6272493 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6272494 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6272495 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6272496 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6272497 it was imperative this year that we delivered our projects well and profitably for customers employees and shareholders alike
6272498 im delighted to say that we have done that whilst at the same time building a well balanced order book
6272499 we have focused this year on getting strategic clarity strengthening our organisation and nurturing our core engineering procurement and construction skills for the long term
6272500 the year end order book of 1 2 billion provides 600m of order coverage for our 2008 09 revenues which are expected to be augmented from a further 200m of work awarded subject to contract finalisation since year end
6272501 the fundamentals in our chosen markets are solid despite the uncertainty in the global finance sector and we have sight of a wealth of opportunities particularly in the gas markets in australia and across the region
6272502 in the coming year we will continue to build capacity by focusing on recruitment and training and through our investment in equipment
6272503 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6272504 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6272505 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6272506 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6272507 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6272508 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6272509 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6272510 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6272511 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6272512 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6272513 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6272514 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6272515 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6272516 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6272517 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6272518 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6272519 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6272520 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6272521 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6272522 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6272523 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6272524 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6272528 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6272529 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6272542 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6272543 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6272544 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6272545 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6272546 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6272547 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6272566 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6272567 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6272568 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6272569 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6272570 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6272571 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6272572 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6272573 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6272574 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6272575 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6272576 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6272577 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6272578 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6272579 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6272586 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

6272612 this new paradigm is going to have families being more deliberate about the cost of transportation spending and energy costs thats a new phenomenon in the united states that will be the change that will change development patterns
6272613 as we approach a period of heightened energy prices western new york planners must set goals for the improvement of its transportation systems in terms of convenience for riders and more than ever energy efficiency
6272614 if we look at buffalo areas birth and not so distant past our geography has endowed us with the benefits as a hub of transportation western new york needs to confront high energy prices as an opportunity for economic growth and development
6272615 without this investment nothing of this could have been achieved

6272617 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6272618 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6272619 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6272620 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6272621 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6272622 nothing is more degrading than hunger especially when man made it breeds anger social disintegration ill health and economic decline
6272623 only by acting together in partnership can we overcome this crisis today and for tomorrow hundreds of millions of the worlds people expect no less
6272624 none of these factors in isolation would have caused the very high increases we are seeing
6272625 the complex causes of the food and agriculture crisis require an equally complex and comprehensive response
6272626 from 1980 to 2005 aid to agriculture fell from 8 bn to 3 4 bn agricultures share of official development assistance fell from 17 per cent in 1980 to 3 per cent in 2006
6272627 we believe the most comprehensive way to deal with high food prices hunger and poverty is to invest in agriculture and raise food production

6272676 when i heard barack obama and then read his books i thought heres somebody who honestly believes in change and believes the way we have been doing things doesnt have to be the way we keep doing them i was excited that finally someone in a leadership position believes things can be different in a way that matters to me so i made my first contribution in may of 2007
6272677 one time i set a goal to have a certain amount by midnight before one of the primaries i sent out a fundraising email and met my goal

6272718 it is not unusual especially with these light aircraft accidents to never be able to determine the cause
6272719 from the damage to the propeller the way the propeller blades shattered at impact it would lead us to conclude already that the engine was developing power at the point of impact
6272720 we know from the impact of the aircraft with the ground the fact it was almost a vertical descent in the final moments typically that is an indication of some type of departure from controlled flight
6272721 the continuity of the controls we established that it looks like everything was working properly with the controls
6272722 there is no type of recording device on these aircraft there were no direct eye witnesses of the event itself that means the only person that was part of the event itself was the pilot and obviously because of his condition it could be many weeks before we get the opportunity to speak with him
6272723 it is our experience that individuals who go through this type of traumatic event and the type of collision with the ground that he went through often their memories are kind of wiped about what actually went on before the occurrence itself

6272728 located at the point where ecstasy tips over into terror pyramids is a beguiling nightmare of an album
6272729 way way way recommended a new aq favorite for sure
6272730 pyramids just redefined grimness for a generation this is music you lose yourself and your sanity to i wanna hear more
6272731 pyramids could possibly be post post post rock that hasnt been invented yet
6272732 unless youre coming off heroin and want to re experience the feeling of nodding off stay away
6272733 haunting and uniquely unnerving the band has done a fine job of executing their vision and i can see fully why hydra head records includes them on their distinguished roster
6272734 it emerges from the black slowly winds into a climax fades away and when youre done you can only remember sketchy details
6272735 vicious and devastating music a challenging and thought provoking debut album that is equally spellbinding and frustrating
6272736 a thundering post rock post everything blitzkrieg on your senses
6272737 a record filled with a plethora of interchangeably fine moments the adventurous and the fans of exceptional free form post metal will find much merit within and the rest will incorrectly think that anyone could do this
6272738 some of it is beautiful in its own cocteau twins way other parts are nightmarish atonal washes but all in all it forms one of those albums ill probably be returning to every so often over time
6272739 pyramids is a free form sort of band to put it lightly
6272740 intense terrifying bombast resolutely unique a place no album should ever take you totally weird and totally new
6272741 a very impressive debut alternatingly very beautiful horrifyingly ugly and immensely promising for next time
6272742 theres barely a deviation in the divisive pattern of abrasive industrial grind and over thrashed ethereal numbers the album flips between until the closing trio of songs fully succumb to the mind numbing gothic electro percussion stuttering that makes what would otherwise be a solid shoegazer disc virtually un listenable to anyone whose mother wasnt pregnant with them while operating a jackhammer nine to five while listening to my bloody valentine obsessively

6273126 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6273127 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6273128 yes you can turn on the publishing feature but you then cant save sites as a template
6273129 yes cqwp can aggregate content from multiple sites but only the current site collection
6273130 yes you can have a column that looks up values from another list but only in the same site
6273131 yes you can create custom field types but they wont show up in the document information panel in msoffice apps
6273132 yes you can copy content from one site to another with stsadm but it is the whole site and whats more incomplete anyway
6273133 yes you can create calculated columns but they are not available for use lookups columns
6273134 yes you can sort a caml query based on a text field but you cant store more than 255 characters in a text field if you definitely need to store more chars you lose the sorting ability
6273135 yes you can use different field types for site columns but dont try to change the type once they have been used in a list somewhere
6273136 things become special because people believe them to be special
6273137 this isnt a bill clinton situation where he lied to the public before coming clean
6273138 this isnt a bill clinton situation where he lied to the public before coming clean
6273139 this isnt like bill clinton who lied under oath and was forced to come clean
6273140 edwards isnt even an elected official so this whole thing is completely asinine
6273141 just to reiterate his moral judgment is certainly in question but that isnt a topic that we should necessarily be debating
6273142 but the fact of the matter is that i find his behavior reprehensible but thats for he and his wife to sort out and it appears they have
6273143 and if his wife has forgiven him for that then i think we should all just butt out
6273144 increase delivery time of star destroyers by 10 over the next 12 months
6273145 if an executive sponsor sith lord finds out you spent a large amount of galactic credits and it didnt pay off now youre in deep water with no one to support you a sith lord is liable to feed you to a panna monster in such a case
6273146 oh these guys know nothing about application development security collaboration insert word here
6273147 oh they are so not ready for what they are getting themselves into
6273148 ongoing conflict over religious proselytizing in the u s military
6273149 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6273150 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6273151 that petraeus didnt know his private written endorsement of the book had been public since last year but petraeus spokesman col steven boylan says petraeus was unaware because he has been in iraq since february 2007
6273152 okay i want to change my hair but i want to keep the colour and keep it the same length
6273153 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
6273154 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6273155 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
6273156 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6273157 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6273158 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6273159 wie du heisst nicht xzy klar bist du es du kannst mich nicht verarschen kenne dich seit wir beide 5 sind
6273160 hey sorry mein namen ist martin sorry bin nicht den typ den du denkst
6273161 hey du bist den schauspieler den von gestern abend in der also weder mein akzent noch meinen echten namen nix konnte das maedel ueberzeugen dass ich nicht der typ war sie hat gebeten bitte bitte mach mir ein autogramm
6273162 good show you rock and may take that in point form if you wish
6273163 but even since the revival of the olympics in the modern age athletes have looked for ways to live the olympic ideal to be fitter higher and stronger than their fellows
6273164 here the only rules are those that the sport gives within the bounds of the games you may not cheat but outside you may do anything to yourself anything that you deem necessary to make you the athlete you want no the athlete you need to be
6273165 ladies and gentlemen this is the bleeding edge of technology
6273166 we are maintaining our buy recommendation and target price of 27 pesos for cemexs shares
6273167 although we see the nationalization as negative the impact of the lost ebitda is not enough to change our recommendation
6273168 qbs in the jeff tedford mike leach urban meyer steve spurrier systems rarely are asked to read more than a third of the field and tend to complete primarily short dink and dunk passes that allow for quicker decisions to be made and more accuracy their systems do not promote the development of a quarterback but rather hide their shortcomings while padding stats that can easily fool not only the average fan but even the most experienced evaluator
6273169 into the spread despite the fact that neither actually run a spread offense
6273170 the nfl looks at that from not only working with a quarterback but an offensive tackle who protects a drop back passer
6273171 if you ran the spread in the pros youd get killed
6273172 i could never do it in a heavy dose myself because the quarterback gets exposed
6273173 ive had an opportunity to listen to coach meyer and hes a very dynamic speaker
6273174 traditionally here at williston were not going to get the big linemen so weve got to have more skill guys than linemen
6273175 i think its much easier to understand and conceptualize for young coaches
6273176 i think we see it a lot in high schools and i think its going to have a good life in football
6273177 one of the best gator fan sites ive seen on the web

6273192 8 for this imagine if i had bought it new back in the day
6273193 folks now that weve taken a good hard look at it we need to start from scratch
6273194 folks you have convinced me its the only way to go lets start from scratch with single payer
6273195 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6273196 in another architecture change linden lab is deploying mono as a foundation for running the linden scripting language lsl is the language used to control behavior of objects in world mono is being deployed this quarter starting on the beta grid mono will allow scripts to run up to 700 times faster than they now do theoretically although in practice performance has been 100 to 200 times faster than current rates miller said the goal of the mono deployment as with the havok 4 6 rollout is to make second life more predictable and stable
6273197 there are a number of things about the architecture of our current server infrastructure that inhibit a source code release
6273198 there are a lot of cases of monolithic design and improper trust relationships between components that would need to be addressed
6273199 nearly all users agree to certain policies when signing up the companies reserve the right to suspend or delete a users avatar and seize virtual assets that have been accumulated most also allow users to report abusive behavior and provide a tool to let members ignore bothersome avatars
6273200 prohibits users from spamming others with unwanted messages or displaying racy images repeat offenders run the risk of having their google accounts deleted or in extreme cases being reported to real world authorities
6273201 i think making someone wear something of a scarlet letter is a good way of doing things
6273202 many virtual universes leave the law in the hands of their users allowing each world to develop its own moral code but a lot of bad behavior is tolerated by residents said gartner analyst stephen prentice and often banished users can simply create new avatars
6273203 the problem is that the relationship in identity between an avatar and the real person behind it is quite tenuous
6273204 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
6273205 karena aku adalah tuhan dan aku adalah adil aku adalah kebenaran dan segala yang aku lakukan adalah benar
6273206 tuhan aku tidak mengerti mengapa aku tidak dapat memperoleh apa yang aku pinta dari mu
6273207 aku akan menjelaskannya kepadamu adalah suatu ketidakadilan dan tidakbenaran bagi ku untuk memenuhi keinginanmu karena aku tidak dapat memberikan sesuatu yang bukan seperti engkau tidaklah adil bagi ku untuk memberikan seseorang yang penuh dengan cinta dan kasih kepadamu jika terkadang engkau masih kasar atau memberikan seseorang yang pemurah tetapi engkau masih kejam atau seseorang yang mudah mengampuni tetapi engkau sendiri masih suka menyimpan dendam seseorang yang sensitif namun engkau sendiri tidak
6273208 adalah lebih baik jika aku memberikan kepadamu seseorang yang aku tahu dapat menumbuhkan segala kualitas yang engkau cari selama ini daripada membuat engkau membuang waktu mencari seseorang yang sudah mempunyi semuanya itu pasanganmu akan berasal dari tulangmu dan dagingmu dan engkau akan melihat dirimu sendiri di dalam dirinya dan kalian berdua akan menjadi satu pernikahan adalah seperti sekolah suatu pendidikan jangka panjang pernikahan adalah tempat dimana engkau dan pasanganmu akan saling menyesuaikan diri dan tidak hanya bertujungan untuk menyenangkan hati satu sama lain tetapi untuk menjadikan kalian manusia yang lebih baik dan membuat suatu kerjasama yang solid aku tidak memberikan pasangan yang sempurna karena engkau tidak sempurna aku memberikanmu seseorang yang dapat tumbuh bersamamu
6273209 will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it
6273210 why do they give a medal for shooting with a bow and arrow but not with a slingshot target shooting which involves pistols and rifles is a sport that in my opinion has no requirements at all if the country were to grant a gun permit to someone like me i would easily earn the country four medals since they discovered that the africans run and jump faster the whites have decided to add additional competitions that the poorer nations will never be able to compete in what can you do if in ethiopia there is no abundance of tennis courts swimming pools and gymnasiums moreover they have introduced branches of sport that require the purchase of expensive equipment kayaks sailboats rifles and even bows and arrows have to be regulation and probably each set costs at least nis 5 000 not including the arrows a conspiracy is the only explanation i can think of when i try to understand why synchronized swimming is an olympic event in a perfect world everyone has to be given a chance
6273211 ninety four per cent are in favour of their new eba
6273212 the company is certainly fairly well placed to share the profits with the workers who helped achieve these profits
6273213 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6273214 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6273215 kay hull therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6273216 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6273217 these are not full time jobs these are seasonal jobs available for a brief period of time each year and something of particular interest to the pacific nations
6273218 for years australia has been unable to fill these positions we cant just continue to leave our farmers in the lurch
6273219 i have no doubt that there are a number of other nations in our region that would desperately like to be part of our program but we are starting this very cautiously
6273220 arguably the most significant change in immigration policy that weve had in a generation
6273221 we are concerned about health checks security checks compliance how do we make sure they are going to go back
6273222 its understandably very much welcomed out in a number of these areas where they are so desperate and it will have an economic benefit in those areas
6273223 that kind of information is the sort of thing that will help people if theyre looking to make informed individual consumer choices
6273224 its not for me to make those kinds of broad judgments
6273225 the national survey is done on a national basis i think its very useful for giving basic strong information about competitive pressure in the australian market place but were really doing two different things
6273226 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6273227 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6273228 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6273229 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6273230 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6273231 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6273232 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6273233 letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6273234 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6273235 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6273236 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6273237 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6273238 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6273239 those are the most prevalent but if you have a product catalog you need to ensure product descriptions are correct and that the price makes sense
6273240 offering these slate tiles which are just a small sample of the mansions historic charm for sale on the internet gives missourians and anyone interested in history and this historic home a chance to bring some of that history into their own homes
6273241 we started in 1993 with one lone developer ian murdock
6273242 today we have over 1 000 registered developers scattered all over the world with thousands more in the community working on parts of the system packages documentation and translation
6273243 we can also fairly claim to be one of the most stable and reliable distros too we dont expect our users to ever have to re install their systems
6273244 we were one of the first projects to understand that the real power of open source software is to include the community
6273245 theres been a lot about debian that just happened but that was very deliberate i was a student i had limited time and i knew that i wasnt going to be able to do all this myself so we set out specifically to figure out how we could leverage a distributed workforce i remember that when the project started people were saying that farming out all these pieces to developers would never work but it actually worked out pretty well i think that debians influence in how open source development is done cant be over stated
6273246 it was really the first linux distribution to adopt the package system from unix
6273247 it turned out to be a really good metaphor for system management too
6273248 i think debian has come a long way in the last few years
6273249 we have tackled several key problems that have troubled us for ages from a technical point weve made debian much easier to install configure and use processes and community wise we have made a lot of changes youll find that the debian community is quite pleasant and that to a large extent we no longer deserve the bad reputation of a hostile community
6273250 finally there have been major improvements to our core teams many of our teams have had structural problems for years and showed little activity but lately weve been able to add new contributors to a number of teams such as the release security and ftpmaster teams and theres a lot of energy in those teams
6273251 in awesome condition not restored rust free chrome in excellent condition recently rebuilt and ready to be driven
6273252 warning the location you selected is not maintained by the city of grand rapids instead it falls within the jurisdiction of kent county road commission if you continue with the request it will be forwarded to the correct organization for handling by them
6273253 there is still a giant pothole at this location and it is getting bigger for a time there were some cones placed around it but people appear to have just run them over i first reported this on july 25th if its not fixed within 30 days the city can be held liable for any damages it causes please take care of this dangerous hazard on one of the citys busier roads thanks a lot
6273254 i am sure roy carroll has good intentions and probably would like to see an office tower built downtown but i personally dont think that will happen anytime soon
6273255 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6273256 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6273257 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6273258 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6273259 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6273260 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6273261 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6273262 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6273263 as the worlds leading premium domain name marketplace namemedia has developed the worlds largest network of smb targeted resale marketing partners our mission is to create a global network of smb focused domain buyers and sellers the name com partnership we are announcing today is an important milestone towards this objective

6273265 weve been impressed with the consistent quality of their inventory and business for a long time
6273266 from a security standpoint the change in firefox 3 kind of makes sense but from a usability standpoint the implementation is too confusing
6273267 this behavior means that a public web site basically cant be encrypted unless they are willing to pay an approved vendor a yearly fee for a certificate
6273268 this has two effects first some sites are forced to pay for certificates that they otherwise wouldnt have bought second some sites are forced to go without encryption that they otherwise would have had
6273269 this is really an issue of the basic principles of internet openness everyone has equal access to the features of http or ssh theres no reason why there should be artificial constraints on access to https but thats exactly what the firefox ssl behavior does

6273276 hes has lightening quick speed off the ball and added some strength over the summer that should help him have an excellent year
6273277 were pretty solid at the linebacker position and were going to need the defense to come up with some big plays this year
6273278 there is not a great deal of change in the budget
6273279 i think the fire district has done a good job on holding the line on increases for 2009
6273280 we have some big items we have to look forward to
6273281 they try to make me wear the banana costume every time
6273282 weve been joking about whos going to win the student or the teacher
6273283 was kind of nerve wracking but now its all right
6273284 hes pretty level headed i think it helps that hes been around ballooning as long as he has weve talked about it since he was five
6273285 i think the administration feels that i was ineffective and would be ineffective in the future in representing veterans over at the legislature
6273286 as for the reasons thats debatable but in my opinion as a result of comments ms vincent made to the commission they asked for my resignation
6273287 i appreciate hal dulles service on the missouri veterans commission and wish him well
6273288 i commend him for his service to our nation as a veteran and to our state on this important commission
6273289 we are proud of the service mr dulle has provided veterans and the state of missouri
6273290 i was in that meeting yesterday and he wasnt asked to resign
6273291 you see your status as secretary of state of the usa is fast becoming as pathetic as your status as national security advisor was back in the days of 9 11 when you failed to provide any security whatsoever for your people
6273292 when advising clients we often tell them it is not a matter of if you sustain a privacy breach it is more a matter of when you sustain one given our understanding about the risks to sensitive and personal information in organizations we approached dr larry ponemon noted researcher on privacy and data security practices to create objective tools that could actually improve a companys ability to manage a privacy incident we are quite pleased with the end results achieved
6273293 our study provides further evidence of the importance of having a good quality privacy incidence response plan in place
6273294 more than 83 of respondents believe that the individuals affected by the data breach lost trust and confidence in their organizations ability to protect their personal information as we have found in our consumer studies on trust these perceptions often result in the loss of customer loyalty in fact 80 of respondents in the pbi study reported that a certain percentage of data breach victims terminated their relationship with the organization
6273295 one of our aims at boonville is to present emerging artists people that represent the future

6273301 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6273302 hospitality house is the only place in the city that serves breakfast to the homeless
6273303 the nonprofit hospitality house is the only place in the city that provides breakfast to people who are hungry every weekday except wednesday when the greensboro urban ministry has a community breakfast urban ministry otherwise serves breakfast only to those who stay overnight at the weaver house
6273304 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more
6273305 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6273306 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6273307 weve been on this path for the last few years theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
6273308 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
6273309 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6273310 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6273311 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6273312 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6273313 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6273314 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6273315 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6273316 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6273317 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6273318 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6273319 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6273323 it wont be just one discussion there will be several
6273324 paypal will continue to cooperate with the reserve bank during discussions relating to our no surcharging policy
6273325 since launching in early 2005 paypal has always had ongoing dialogue with australias regulators and governing bodies and will continue to do so
6273326 we do not intend to speculate nor comment preemptively on what the outcome of these discussions might be
6273327 over recent months the payments system board has received a number of comments on the no surcharge and no steering rules that apply to payments using the paypal system as well as the mandated acceptance of paypal on ebays auction site
6273328 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
6273329 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules
6273330 were very excited by the rbas findings its an exciting win for us
6273331 throughout the site ebay portrays paypal as the only safe payment method and inferring that all other methods are unsafe further this message is reinforced through media advertising and statements in media interviews
6273332 they advertise a buyer protection scheme for paypal that is entirely illusory protection in the form of reimbursement of lost funds is only forthcoming if paypal can recover it from the seller
6273333 i could not offer an on line tracking number to them
6273334 the evidence available does not support the view that paypal is the most secure method of payment or offers the best service for all transactions
6273335 i am a fuckheaded know nothing nincompoop who leaps tall

6273340 but people need to realize that these big airlines have big resources
6273341 they have horrible income statements and balance sheets but they have what i call inertia
6273342 airlines also can pull all these hidden assets out of every little nook and cranny and sell them to keep going
6273343 small carriers may not be able to do that but these really big airlines have tremendous underestimated staying ability
6273344 people talk about bankruptcy and liquidation but they dont understand how deep these big airlines resources really are

6273375 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
6273376 i think he was frustrated after we scored he insulted the ref who then sent him off he had no choice to be fair the cromford players tried to stop him but he pushed one of them out of the way came from behind the ref and punched him
6273377 i just think he needs to play and hes shown he can play
6273378 he had a good game last week and needs some more
6273379 im just happy to be out here competing and im getting a chance
6273380 whoever comes out there im ready to compete lets see what happens on friday
6273381 as negotiation items receive tentative agreement they shall be reduced to writing and initialed by either party such initialing shall not constitute final agreement
6273382 i think they thought the mea representative had accepted it on behalf of the teachers
6273383 but its tentative its not final until both parties ratify it
6273384 when a total tentative agreement is reached through negotiating the outcome shall be reduced to writing and submitted to the association for ratification and then to the board for formal approval pursuant to the timeliness prescribed by the orc 4117 10
6273385 despite what everyone says the tentative agreement needs to be ratified by both sides
6273386 any time you can work toward a resolution that is fantastic
6273387 want to make sure that everything is correct before we take it to the membership and to the board
6273388 i said id love to play some more i understand where hes coming from
6273389 he said let me think about it as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it it was good to go out that way throwing a touchdown
6273390 with the giants playing as recently as they did im not sure what their perspective is going to be on play time im not really sure i havent really set that yet and id like to see some more kellen and brett as well ill probably work it out as we go through the week and see how the game goes
6273391 i really havent set a distinct time like hes going to go definitely through the third quarter its going to be 30 plays or something like that
6273392 itll be more than last week i also want to gauge where he is in terms of his arm where the score is and all that stuff will kind of play in i thought about keeping him in last week and then thought about it two seconds later and pulled him out
6273393 with every preseason game ive played in id love to play the whole game
6273394 if im going to come out here and practice id love to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it
6273395 dealing the cards in practice is important but theres no substitute for live action
6273396 so what i dont get in a game were trying to get in practice obviously theres no substitute for games
6273397 over the time ive been here its always been great to have the energy from the fans
6273398 it gets a little bit longer at times in training camp and theres some times where the coffees just not getting it done but having them here having the kids here having the passion here its always great well spend a lot of time after practice signing autographs for fans just being able to spend time with them is pretty unique its going to be our last day here for a public practice at hofstra so its a pretty special day
6273399 i dont think we can rule out a government intervention fannie and freddie are crucial to stabilizing the housing market and the housing market is crucial to stabilizing the banks and the financial services industry
6273400 given where the prices are trading at i dont see anything but a government bailout at this point
6273401 the market is telling you that the government is going to step in its almost a self fulfilling prophesy
6273402 se tienen 17 canciones listas realizando una mejora sobre el smear campaign siendo este nuevo disco muy rapido y pesado con momentos un poco extra os en la musica y un poco mas de experimentacion y discordancia en las guitarras
6273403 the number came down significantly by the same token we have a lot more work to do
6273404 this will send the signal that these lists usher in help rather than resulting in a scarlet letter
6273405 these guys fate was sealed as soon as they got in that fire
6273406 and when they called for help they couldnt even get through right away
6273407 there are so many people responsible who need to stand up and say they made mistakes
6273408 they parkersburg authorities didnt pick him up because nothing was showing a warrant for him
6273409 we have no idea where he is i heard they were trying to make it to south carolina he greathouse could really go into the wood work
6273410 i want to see the status of restitution and what efforts can be made toward restitution
6273411 i want you to understand the prosecutor and the victims to understand we are not a collection agency i am looking at the criminality of the conduct
6273412 hes just prepared to accept responsibility for his actions and hes looking to make restitution
6273413 i dont know when it was done but i know a significant amount of money has been paid
6273414 you become emotionally involved with a job like teaching i always did you drive by that school you cant help but have feelings
6273415 i wanted to see how our kids did on their test scores and i wanted to meet the teacher that took my place just to see if there was anything i could do to help her
6273416 he left a lot of materials and i have kept all those items
6273417 those items are not replaceable they represent his 35 years here and they are really a part of this school
6273418 i have his items and i plan to use them
6273419 when i pull them out i can say do you remember mr
6273420 you do realize that you have some big shoes to fill
6273421 ill drive by and stop in i wont be one of those forgotten retirees ill see how everyone is doing and if they need advice ill give it to them i doubt theyll ask for it though
6273422 at first i thought can i even match reinharts reputation
6273423 he put so much into this school and he has done some really good things it may take me a couple of years but i am going to get there too
6273424 itd go down and then itd go back there was just a particle in there that kept catching
6273425 weve been waiting a long time to unify our group which has been split between cyprus and crete we are excited to combine both groups who have worked so hard on this project and are so enthusiastic about setting out for gaza
6273426 on the way in today we had the cypriot authorities escorting us now its time for the world to escort us to gaza
6273427 our office has not decided whether or not to intervene but we are seriously looking into the issue
6273428 any regulation established by government regardless of what level there are always stipulations
6273429 many times there are ways to get waivers around those stipulations
6273430 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6273431 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6273432 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6273433 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6273434 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6273435 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6273436 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6273437 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6273438 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6273439 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
6273440 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6273441 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6273442 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6273443 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6273444 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6273445 thats a testament especially to a guy like fred a veteran whos already accomplished so much and made a lot of money and done everything you want to do in this league
6273446 for him to still have that kind of drive just shows you what kind of competitor he is
6273447 you do so much with the all star games and the combines and stuff you never really get your legs under you last year we changed the defense so i wasnt completely comfortable
6273448 but this year being able to control my offseason with all the work to be fresh and having such a great knowledge of coach spagnuolos defense i just feel like im in the best shape physically and mentally since i can remember
6273449 al qaeda really hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch has hurt us particularly in the case of fox news fox news is worse than al qaeda worse for our society its as dangerous as the ku klux klan ever was

6273465 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6273466 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6273467 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6273468 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job

6273496 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6273497 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6273498 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6273499 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6273500 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6273501 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6273502 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6273503 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6273504 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters the sandusky county democratic party v
6273505 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6273506 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6273507 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6273508 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6273509 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6273510 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6273511 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hours waits were widespread
6273512 came from columbus and cleveland where a huge proportion of the states democratic voters live
6273513 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent rejection rates for provisional ballots in african american precincts wards in cleveland ohio averaged 37 percent and ranged as high as 51 percent
6273514 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga countys minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers there were both inconsistent and illegal requests for photo identification
6273515 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct effectively disenfranchising hundreds and more likely thousands of voters
6273516 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6273517 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6273518 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight 80lb text weight
6273519 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states we need to enact legislation that will
6273520 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country
6273521 if in fact we see it is our obligation to secure democracy around the world to monitor and oversee free and fair elections in other countries surely we must ensure protect and guarantee the right to vote right here at home
6273522 it is a pleasure to be here and to know the scientology volunteer ministers the first time i saw them i knew they were special people they asked us to have a location for their tent so they could help us this was unusual normally we help others no one offers to help us i experienced their technology and i loved it and i learned how to use it and i am using it it is good to know that there are people like the scientology volunteer ministers while we help the persons body the scientology volunteer ministers help him or her as a person that is very very important it is very good to have them here we need them with us and i urge everyone to take advantage of this opportunity
6273523 i have the pleasure to know the scientology volunteer ministers and the opportunity to work with them i know my life is better because of this i have gained the ability to organize and know how to achieve my goals with the tools they teach it is incredible how easy it is to create miracles in the lives of others here in the tent you can learn very simple technology to improve your life for example those who have had problems with communication those who want to help somebody but dont know how

6273527 considering my other sources that says repentance was used as the main weapon against the plague also shows that a lot of time waited asking or hoping god would provide the answers this time could have been used to figure out what natural causes spread the plague or least developing a method to figure out the unknown

6273529 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6273530 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool

6273571 the new option house was a four story brick building erected on the site of the former building
6273572 using arc lights for illumination two crews of men worked day and night to meet that goal
6273573 mcbride sold the option house in 1925 to james rich who expanded the building adding 13 rooms with showers to the rear of the structure in 1935 a 2 ton brunswick bar was installed and a nightclub called peacock alley opened up on the second floor dining hall during the depression the hotel nearly closed but friendly local bankers kept the business going

6273676 there has been much hoo hah over the last couple of days over john mccains story of a guard who had loostened his bonds overnight and who later on christmas day stood alongside mccain outside of his cell and wordlessly drew a cross in the dirt with his foot stood alongside mccain for several minutes before erasing it to avoid punishment from his own superiors in the communist vietnamese hierarchy the lefties without evidence accuse mccain of plagiarizing the account from solzhinitsen as if no christian under persecution could ever have made such a gesture before in recorded history by the time of the mccain incident the ichthys fish was in common usage as a symbol of christianity having been revived from the early christians living under roman persecution a fact that seems to have been lost on the undereducated moron who penned the kos diary who heard the story and missed the historical resonance of the gesture instead laughably thinking that it sounded something like a scene of ben hur

6273890 what weve done is come to an outcome where the airline has kept intact the headline 3 per cent wage rise but theres been some changes to our wage classifications structure that sees all of our members get a minimum of 4 per cent increase in remuneration per annum up to 5 8 per cent per annum

6273896 this is part of a family that had farmed land here for years
6273897 all of a sudden were instructing someone they have to sell that land and that seems a bit ridiculous to me at this point
6273898 i know they have to have laws in regard to restrictions and i respect that but just in this case this farm is no threat to anyone
6273899 i wanted to keep the family farm for sentimental value my grandfather was an original homesteader in 1909 so the farm has been in the family for 99 years before my mom passed away she wanted the farm to go to my sister and myself and then to the grandchildren
6273900 my grandfather he was not a quitter he showed the saskatchewan spirit to go forward and thats what i sort of want to hang onto
6273901 i think the first thing im going to tell them to start when you make a decision use common sense they have exemptions they can make and in this case should have been i feel personally as a farmer from the past should have been used
6273902 i think common sense tells you this isnt something that threatens our way of life on the family farm
6273903 we dont want to open it up to the point where all of a sudden theres corporations from all over the world owning big blocks of land here as a farmer i think that would hinder my business

6273910 mccain has been on the offensive against obama during the last month over energy concerns with polls showing strong majorities supporting his call for an expansion of offshore oil drilling as gasoline prices hover near 4 a gallon
6273911 obama had opposed new offshore drilling but said recently he would support a limited expansion as part of a comprehensive energy program that was one of several recent policy shifts for obama as he positions himself for the general election battle but zogby said the changes could be taking a toll on obamas support particularly among democrats and self described liberals
6273912 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6273913 the telephone poll of 1 089 likely voters had a margin of error of 3 percentage points
6273914 now of course this is not a scientific poll just comments from two people i know yet these are not party insiders theyre just regular folks like you and me and they are having serious doubts about voting democrat in november if obama is on the ticket
6273915 he obama never worked with us weve tried to have bipartisan backroom discussions where we just talk about things he and his staff would never take part in those discussions

6273920 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6273921 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties

6273936 we know that there were two persons there who fled we dont know if they were suspects or witnesses but we sure would like them to come forward so we can figure that out
6273937 i think its important to inform the public that this rash of recent violent crime is nothing out of the ordinary frankly if you compare our violent crime rate with other cities of our size were pretty low

6273959 ive been a lot more open in the last couple of years since ive met my wife

6273963 things that screw us up on the track i go nuts
6273964 but they receive it well and do the same when i mess up
6273965 hes very funny i would call him far from quiet
6273966 theres always been someone who seems to come from the bottom to the top
6273967 theres not going to be emphasis on that guy at the bottom if youre one of those bottom guys you need to understand the history and understand what it takes to reach your goals i was one of those guys who set my goals and went after them and i was able to accomplish them
6273968 the one thing that set me apart was that i didnt make the same mistake twice
6273969 whatever coaching pointer or critique i would get i learned from it and never made that mistake again
6273970 a lot of guys can get over 1 000 yards if they carry the ball enough
6273971 if you can average in that 5 yards a carry range youre doing something special
6273972 some guys are able to withstand that punishment week in and week out
6273973 other guys cant take the punishment and cant take the number of carries the key is if you do carry the ball 25 times a game can you keep that quickness and speed and that endurance throughout the game all those questions will be answered as time goes on
6273974 i feel i have the ability to set myself apart from other guys in the league
6273975 i like the competitive aspect but theres a fine line between bravery and stupidity were not talking about jack mildren and oklahoma thats not how you do it we want him to play 16 games
6273976 but were not looking for yards after contact from the quarterback thats ok for running backs but not quarterbacks
6273977 and hes not afraid to yell at lineman see i think i like him because hes a lot like me
6273978 i think youll see a completely different player this year
6273979 if i play well were going to have a good season ive never been that guy holding the team up so i dont want to be that guy now im working my butt off to get to the point where im looked at as one of the guys helping to carry this team

6273985 i think it is important that players play the game to win and not to not lose
6273986 its important to always stay on the attack and never back on your heels
6273987 every team has to go into the year thinking that they are going to win the stanley cup
6273988 but there are 29 teams that go in with that thought and dont get it done but you have to at least start the year with that being your first goal you are not going to win every game but you have to go in thinking that you can its not about the players playing for the coach its about the players playing for each other
6273989 we were talking a little bit about the way he approaches the game and i am definitely excited about this year its going to be a lot of fun

6273993 as soon as i heard about it i knew i wanted to be there
6273994 i have been watching the islanders since i was 5 and have watched the development of this team and there are things i am happy about and things that i am unhappy about
6273995 and i believe it went so well that we are going to do it again i think it was a great outcome i couldnt have asked for better
6273996 we feel reassured the squad is complete even last season we have suffered injuries but we managed to finish the season

6273998 antonio has changed so much since he came to sampdoria
6273999 i am sure he will continue to do very well this season and if he plays at his level he will certainly deserve a chance with the nazionale

6274001 i spoke with the directors in recent days but i think they want to better assess the condition of giorgio chiellini between now and september

6274007 if you arent doing anything wrong what do you have to hide
6274008 if im not doing anything wrong then you have no cause to watch me

6274022 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6274023 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6274024 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6274025 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
6274026 for me to live is christ and to die is gain

6274031 we have a terrible imbalance between male population and female population we have always had that problem and he has brought national attention to bear upon it
6274032 i am certain there will be an awful lot of girls going to mt isa
6274033 when we country people assert who we are and what we are then you find some way of twisting that around and out a malevolent interpretation upon it
6274034 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6274035 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes
6274036 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6274037 the first question she asked before we even began the cleaning was
6274038 she noted my medication and my recent surgery and then as she got to cleaning she said how sorry she was that i had crohns she has two friends with the disease she said and although she doesnt fully understand the disease and what theyve been through she knows it has been a struggle for them has it been difficult for me
6274039 she took the dental tools out of my mouth so i could respond i said that its been a hard year to be sure but i am learning to live with it and it has gotten so much better since the surgery i offered to show her my scar this being my favorite thing to do when i talk to anyone right now and told her it was surprisingly easy to endure she asked what the purpose of the surgery was and i explained how the crohns had affected my small intestine and what the procedure involved briefly because i understand that people have varying degrees of tolerance for talk about cutting up and sewing organs together
6274040 she said she was glad it went well for me and then asked if i needed to follow a special diet in general i follow a low residue diet but beyond that its pretty complicated and takes awhile to explain i said she asked if i could give her an example say what i would be having for lunch chicken with wild mushrooms rice and very boiled carrots mmm getting hungry but then she was done i thanked her for the cleaning and the compassionate ear and then you may recall my dentist came in
6274041 now allow me to explain why i was so grateful for the way she discussed my disease

6274043 a good portion of it is juvenile and wilson bless him throws himself into every humiliation possible while still being lovable enough barely that we understand why his bandmates grow to respect him
6274044 there were plenty of opportunities where the filmmakers could have weighed the picture down with lame gags or attempts to squeeze a few more laughs but in service of the story and the characters theyve simplifying things and managed to turn out a goofy and sweet film
6274045 rainn wilson surprises as he carries the film and he helps deliver one of the funnier movies out in cinemas right now and its up against some competition
6274046 now its the men rising to applaud the women especially in the australian team
6274047 id like to think its a good reflection on our society something we should be proud of that clearly there are these equal opportunities and that wouldnt be the case elsewhere i suppose
6274048 theres been a single mindedness perhaps that has resulted in this success of our women over generations now

6274053 looming uncertainty over the shape of the global carbon markets after 2012 and the effects of the credit crunch are contributing to a slowing down of new capital joining the carbon market
6274054 in most other asset classes 63 percent growth in assets under management would be a pretty good story but the 100 percent plus growth in carbon markets between 2006 and 2007 has outpaced growth in carbon funds
6274055 it was a smart call to add a second alarm about eight minutes in
6274056 we needed the extra manpower to rescue the people and fight the fire
6274057 a little more fiscal responsibility but a little less concern about whether people at the top end are going to be the drivers of the economy
6274058 we are long passed the time when a domestic economy can be treated in isolation from the geo political environment
6274059 we vacate this rule because it is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements
6274060 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6274061 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6274062 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6274063 of course at the begining of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6274064 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state
6274065 its a busy and exciting time with lots of unknowns
6274066 but we believe this is a good time to introduce our area and we are finding a lot of interest
6274067 well love to have the big companies come in but its likely to be the risk takers that get here first and hopefully show the others
6274068 we want to attract international investors and we do not have plans to build a national oil group

6274080 ive had a rough day i deserve not to have to exercise
6274081 this is the one thing in my life that i am so unhappy about and it is something that is completely in my own control yet i dont change
6274082 we let the players have this morning off to rest but still had a very productive day in our meetings and out here at practice tonight
6274083 im real pleased with their effort through fall camp and tomorrow well start turning our full attention to texas a amp m and getting well
6274084 i thought we executed really well in a lot of phases of the game during practice
6274085 we had a lot of blitz stuff today some things on team and inside read zone type stuff i thought our team drills went well and then we had a scrimmage at the end for some of our young guys to get a little extra work weve got some younger guys in there we know are going to be players in the future whether they are ready to go now or not we dont know it just depends on if theyre called upon but got a lot of guys in that group we feel like are going to be very good
6274086 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security

6274135 the geology of the jan mayen ridge area is related to what we have off eastern greenland where hydrocarbons have been found
6274136 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6274137 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6274138 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6274139 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6274140 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6274141 we had a strong showing in the primary tonight current returns show we have received over 45 percent of the vote to put these results into perspective during the 2004 campaign i received just 34 percent of the vote in the primary and the general election turned out to be significantly closer
6274142 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6274143 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6274144 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6274145 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6274146 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6274147 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6274148 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6274149 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6274150 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6274151 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6274152 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6274153 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6274154 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6274155 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6274156 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6274157 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6274158 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6274159 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6274160 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6274161 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6274162 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6274163 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6274164 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6274165 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6274166 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6274167 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6274168 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6274169 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6274170 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6274171 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6274172 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6274173 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6274174 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6274175 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6274176 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6274177 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6274178 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6274179 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6274180 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6274181 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6274182 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6274183 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6274184 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6274185 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6274186 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6274187 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6274188 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6274189 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6274190 who are open to doing something on the production side
6274191 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6274192 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6274193 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6274194 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6274195 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6274196 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6274197 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6274198 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6274199 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6274200 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6274201 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6274202 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6274203 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6274204 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6274205 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6274206 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6274207 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6274208 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6274209 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6274210 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6274211 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6274212 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6274213 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6274214 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6274215 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6274216 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6274217 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6274218 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6274219 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6274220 it looks like its a pterodactyl out of a gay jurassic park
6274221 shi ma yi the head military chancellor of wei and hes sazabi in disguise
6274222 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6274223 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6274224 this historic convention provides an excellent opportunity to participate in the discussion of vital topics including u s politics domestic policy issues and international affairs

6274229 by proceeding with a traditional census in 2011 the government risks drawing national and local data needs and systems further apart
6274230 the census has been around for 200 years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services
6274231 we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute public money but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools
6274232 the increasingly intrusive questions that the government is planning for the next census
6274233 many councils have been short changed in government funding because the last census failed to record properly the real number of local residents
6274234 high levels of inward migration have compounded the problems with labour ministers having little clue on the real sizes of populations in many parts of the country
6274235 a group that fights as a monolithic entity and thus undergoes similar experiences rather than a formally defined level of military organization or size of the fighting force

6274240 kami sudah pernah menjalani pertandingan pertandingan di turnamen ini di mana beberapa tim hanya unggul satu poin atau berimbang di akhir kuarter pertama dan seterusnya kami mengerti itu yang kami lakukan adalah tetap tenang
6274241 kami mengerti bahwa kekuatan kami ada pada kedalaman skuad jadi kami hanya terus mencoba menekan selama 40 menit dan membuat anda kelelahan
6274242 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6274243 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6274244 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6274245 small missile threats of the kind that iran or north korea might impose and not aimed in any way at russia
6274246 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6274247 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6274248 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6274249 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6274250 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6274251 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends

6274258 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6274259 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6274260 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6274261 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6274262 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6274263 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency

6274267 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6274268 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6274269 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6274270 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii

6274277 this alleged hit man would follow his ex girlfriend to a restaurant or a party where she would have a drink or two after she left an accident was to be staged to make it appear that she was drinking and driving and died in a car accident
6274278 he was the one who essentially saved this victims life by going ahead and reporting this to law enforcement
6274279 the alleged act was to occur two weeks after another child custody exchange took place
6274280 its very fortunate for the alleged victim that we put things together very quick and he did not have time to hire a real hit man
6274281 we need to raise a little more money we need to do a little more planning
6274282 lets say you want to donate 25 000 you can say i want to give you 10 000 now 1 000 in year two 3 000 in year three were trying to make it as flexible as possible
6274283 were going to alums and people who have an affinity to university athletics theres a philanthropic component to giving
6274284 they are very very conscious of what i am doing and what the other persons like us are doing there
6274285 in the past students like us tried to go to u s and other airports and have been arrested at the airport
6274286 if you have no other reason then you can punish me this is up to you
6274287 i have no power i have no rights to defend your accusation i cant answer any questions from that point
6274288 some of the students the educated people they are not taught about the u s
6274289 although they admire the u s economically and politically they are afraid to come here or be affiliated with a party like us
6274290 they admire our ideology but they do not dare to support they do not dare to go to the u s
6274291 this is a very different country from the one they live in obviously
6274292 burmas been very closed out to the rest of the world for the last decade or so so i think any contact you can make between burmese citizens and the rest of the world is probably a healthy thing

6274294 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6274295 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6274296 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6274297 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6274298 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6274299 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6274300 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here
6274301 people need to come down here and realize there is a wealth of great things to see in southern illinois and now theres a place they can stop
6274302 its an older wine drinking crowd that i have at my place its very laid back
6274303 since high quality grapes are required to make high quality wine the ability of the soils climate and grape growers of southern illinois to produce outstanding grapes is the main reason our region is well suited to making wine the beauty of the region also makes it a perfect place to market the finished product
6274304 our desire was to produce good quality wines that was always my focus
6274305 you really have to consider this the toughest top to bottom conference in the country just because theres not an easy week
6274306 you cant be focusing on just one team as a must win because each week is going to be in that category
6274307 the schedule is obviously harder for everyone in our league just because we have those two new teams who are expected to be in the top 25 of rankings
6274308 if the professional looking sites that are being used to distribute this fake alert malware are anything to go by the criminals behind it are very organized
6274309 using aggressive techniques to infect victims as well for example large spam campaigns and compromised web sites
6274310 i think they feel that i can help in terms of meeting with people
6274311 ive been fortunate to have this job for over 30 years so ive met a lot of people and maybe the fact that im working for southern can help
6274312 i asked siu athletic director mario moccia do you want me to change
6274313 mike has such a rich history hes been broadcasting the games for 30 years
6274314 for many people mike reis is saluki athletics i think that name recognition and credibility opens a lot of doors
6274315 i think ive slipped a little bit on play by play the last couple of years because ive been doing a couple of other things in the radio world now i can focus on play by play
6274316 there are no excuses this is no different than an athlete who gets a little extra time to work on his game i think this enables me to work a little more on my game
6274317 if we were to have a more experienced offense there is sometimes a resistance to learn a new scheme but the guys have really adapted well so far
6274318 i think this offense is going to be very exciting
6274319 with the talent we had last year some people didnt get to play as much but we had a lot of talent on the bench that people didnt get to see so i think we should have the same type of offense this year
6274320 i dont even think sherman has dropped a ball all camp or in the summer but those two are flying under the radar for us but thats a good thing because we dont want to expose all the weapons just yet
6274321 in the past siu was the type of team that would outscore you
6274322 the quarterback is the key how the quarterback situation plays out will say a lot for how they will do this season
6274323 the good thing is that the talent is still there
6274324 and typically guys that havent started before are hungry and all of our guys are hungry to me that is good for our offense
6274325 since theres not a lot of space in wakeland we normally do not promote it as strong as we do the other housing areas
6274326 im willing to pay more because the dorm is so isolated
6274327 two years ago we went to student affairs and partnered with housing and the physical plant and we had the downstairs area of kellogg halls lower level cleaned out and repainted
6274328 were hoping that those workshops help people develop some additional skills and give them additional reasons to stay with us
6274329 we do need to pay attention to their needs and to give them what they need when they are here with us
6274330 our goal was 9 million and we raised 8 2 million and that was over the last five years the 8 2 million consisted mostly of gifts and donations from alumni
6274331 our alumni go into many different fields most of them are related to the media industries in one way or another or education a majority goes into business related to the media industries they could be photographers anything from television personality weather people directors screen writer in journalism reporters editors in advertising business owners and account executives the list goes on and on
6274332 my advice to freshman is to make yourself aware of your surroundings where you live the people your in class and talk to your teachers and get to know them definitely join rsos
6274333 pussycat dolls present girlicious the search for the next doll
6274334 its our biggest exposure yet because its going to half a million homes thats a lot of people
6274335 this is our job our job is to get a product out
6274336 i think all three should challenge for all conference status
6274337 if you have three people who are all conference then youre challenging for a top two spot
6274338 its probably going to be missouri state and wichita state thats who its been the last couple years
6274339 i know missouri state lost one of their best girls but they have a lot of their girls returning still wichita state has won i think the last two or three years
6274340 im going to go try my best and see where that gets me on the team my goals are definitely to set a personal record run faster at every meet and just get stronger going into conference i think we can be one of the top teams
6274341 they took from the negative experience many of them had during cross country and grew from it and became much better runners in the indoor and outdoor season
6274342 a year ago none of them were sure what to expect at this point theyve had that year under their belt from the fairly negative experience in cross country to for toennies and hoelscher experiences of competing at the u s junior track championships
6274343 bubble wrap in the river arseholes never think do they
6274344 its not just bubble wrap and im stuck in the bloody mud give me a pull out i think its a body
6274345 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6274346 the sad fact is that come christmas time we estimate that one million australians will suffer mortgage stress thats a huge number of people that are potentially going to face losing their property unless drastic action is taken
6274347 sydney got richer in the first five years of the new century but that new wealth was very unevenly spread about
6274348 this is consistent with an analysis of the changing income growth across the city with stagnant household incomes in many middle and outer west suburbs contrasting to strong income growth in the inner eastern and northern suburbs
6274349 its a tragic loss to our profession and hell be greatly missed by his work colleagues and of course his family and our condolences go out to them
6274350 dreadful you know its just devastating and just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks
6274351 theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil against overwhelming odds of any chance of success so its terrible
6274352 hes been like part of the family i guess for a long long time
6274353 its just terrible theyre very very upset its been the thing weve been fearing i guess right from the start
6274354 the horse that has tested positive to hendra virus but is otherwise well
6274355 it is very unlikely to pass the disease on while it is in a healthy state but if it relapses and gets sick with the hendra virus again then it would become infected

6274363 the best site on the world wide web although she could cut some of that crazy music she listens to
6274364 this site is not bigger due to lack of access to big piles of money
6274365 this is something we need to take a look at give him some time down a few days with limited activity
6274366 give him a few days to get back and work on his mechanics and get him out on a rehab he just hasnt been able to pitch with the quality weve become accustomed
6274367 at one point it stiffened up and he got through it and he could compete but we havent seen matt with the same consistency and location
6274368 but to know that he and i have worked together and ive watched him progress to this level its a great feeling for the game and for me personally
6274369 it was a matter of the opportunity presenting itself and staying healthy
6274370 what im impressed with is his ability to drive the ball the other way because i didnt see that two years ago last year i saw it a little bit this year i can see where hes starting to figure out how to drive the ball to left center
6274371 hes going to be a big leaguer for a long time

6274375 labour party selection policies that were in train before mmp and would have continued without it
6274376 it will be a very powerful medium for companies to utilise in the future but there needs to be time and commitment given to it and people need to be aware of it and feel comfortable with it first
6274377 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6274378 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
6274379 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6274380 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6274381 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6274382 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6274383 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6274384 if you give me that opportunity if you give me that chance i will fight for you every single day
6274385 ill wake up every day in that white house thinking about those people in martinsville

6274404 the underlying facts in this case are just too serious why should this defendant who made this type of claim be able to just walk away
6274405 she didnt make it back to the party and received a phone call wondering where she was
6274406 when she finally arrived at the party with no money and no crack she said she was scared and told the people she was stopped by police
6274407 shes going to choose the pressure of the law over the pressure of her family the next time
6274408 the claim was made and to some degree remnants of that claim remain out there whether its in the southington police department or the community
6274409 these are accusations that stayed within the southington community for months each and every one of those patrol officers and detectives in southington were affected
6274410 i think this is a matter that should be tried

6274450 to protect and defend our village from the nightwolves just as his friend did he doesnt know his purpose but if he wants to find the answers he will have to find the pieces first
6274451 why cant your grandfather find the answers to my questions i mean he has the power to read minds
6274452 im sorry about my grandfather he doesnt want to use his powers for selfish purposes he believes that you have the answers but havent discovered them
6274453 i am in a very difficult situation i dont have time to play these games i need to find my friends and a way out of here by the way you said that someone was here do you know who was it
6274454 i cannot remember his name but he was a great hero to our village
6274455 about a year ago our village has been terrorized by a group of monsters called the nightwolves they are dark warriors who would only attack our village steal our food and destroy our property at night the warriors and i have been protecting and defending the village from the nightwolves most of the warriors in the village have been killed
6274456 yes our people are frightened they can never go to sleep with the nightwolves alive our village will never be at peace
6274457 i am not certain one night the nightwolves attacked and your friend chased down the leader of the group into the jungle and i have never seen or heard from him since ned wondered what had happened to his friend he didnt want to think the unimaginable
6274458 i think i understand where the villagers are coming from
6274459 when i was young my mother and father had to be separated because of their jobs i had to live with my mother and my twin brother had to live with my father my mother and i lived in a bad neighborhood every time i stepped outside my house i would get bullied i was just a weak frightened defenseless little boy
6274460 when you told me about what happened to your village it just reminds me of how my childhood was i will never forget those days
6274461 you can leave your past but you can never forget it thats what the elder has taught me
6274462 yes when i was young the previous village that i lived in was burned to the ground by the nightwolves i had the chance to escape for the exception of my parents their lives were taken in the hands of the nightwolves i had to watch my parents suffer in pain as i kept on running as far away as possible away from the village throughout the years i lived my whole life in the jungle i had to support myself in order to survive until one day the elder found me and took me in as his own
6274463 yes that is why i do not forget my past now ive gained the courage and strength to live and fight on as my parents wanted i will make sure to get my revenge and avenge my parents
6274464 revenge is not the answer but in this case these nightwolves must be stopped to prevent any more damage to this village
6274465 im a secretary im random female what do you do for a living
6274466 the more you begin to investigate what we think we understand where we came from what we think were doing the more you begin to see weve been lied to weve been lied to by every institution what makes you think for one minute that the religious institution is the only one that has never been touched the religious institutions of this world are put there by the same people who gave you our government your corrupt education who set up your international banking cartels because our masters dont give a damn about you or your family all they care about is what they have always cared about and thats controlling the whole damn world we have been misled away from the true and divine prescence of the universe that men have called god i dont know what god is but i know what he isnt and unless and until you are prepared to look at the whole truth wherever it may go whoever it may lead to if you want to look the other way or if you want to play favorites then somewhere along the line youre gonna find out youre messing with divine justice the more you understand where things came from the more obvious things become and you begin to see lies everywhere you have to know the truth and seek the truth and the truth will set you free
6274467 the world is like a ride in an amusement park
6274468 hey dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride

6274470 the library of congress represented by justice department attorneys has argued that schroer cannot sue because the civil rights act does not protect transsexuals or prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity

6274483 it makes a bigger statement than when you have another officer with you
6274484 its very rewarding seeing the training that you put into him
6274485 the cool thing about computer mixing is that you can kind of mix as you go along

6274526 there is no basis to question the social development of home schooled children
6274527 the academic performance analyses indicate that home school graduates i are as ready for college as traditional high school graduates and that they perform as well on national college assessment tests as traditional high school graduates
6274528 colleges and universities have often and unnecessarily insisted that homeschoolers obtain a general equivalency diploma ged for financial aid because this requirement was usually based on the institutions concerns about federal funding regulations home school legal defense association addressed the situation at its root the association drafted federal legislation to place homeschool college applicants for admissions and financial aid on the same footing as traditionally schooled applicants

6274563 the way our country works you can go off and die you can elect a president i think having a beer should be alright at this age
6274564 the presidents who signed onto this are not looking at the scientific studies that have been done studies that show the 21 age law saves lives

6274568 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention

6274574 what we expect is for it to drift back to the north northwest probably just north of our area
6274575 this request is important for florida counties and we look forward to working with our federal partners as the request is considered
6274576 just like high end garments furnishings are made from one of a kind fabrics and need to be treated as such

6274579 to the contrary she does not have a constitutionally protected right to disseminate false information in a public forum
6274580 were talking about 640 special education routes which gives us special concern as to whether the board is seeking to substantially decrease the service
6274581 we havent even announced the routes yet so its clear that the bus companies are spreading this lie probably to pressure us to add more buses
6274582 we dont want them to add anything we want them to basically run the system in a sensible businesslike fashion its not a lie
6274583 all of my life i have been extremely sensitive to energies in june 2006 i became very ill with pneumonia which was quite a surprise to me as i had not been sick in years something i attributed to my own understanding of the mind body spirit connection i allowed that for reasons unknown to me the illness must have something to do with my own opening to the new energy this was confirmed for me when shortly after my recovery i was able to translate the many energies i could feel around me into words and this opened up to a whole new level of interdimensional communicating i was told that i was reclaiming an ability that i had in the days of lemuria but that it would not fit in my physical body as is hence the pneumonia made room in my lungs for what could not previously be brought through my biology as ancient encodings within my dna were activated since then i have translated the energies of many different nonphysical beings into words and now frequently engage in this kind of communication
6274584 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6274585 it is the charter schools that will get the public to demand that the rest of them come up
6274586 its the charter schools that let parents vote with their feet and tell us what the parents think about
6274587 i think its even a matter of record theyre looking for about 400 million for advertising for the beijing games so go figure as they say
6274588 theyve done very well but on the other hand i mean look at the level of the chinese economy and the amount of medals they were winning in 1996 1997 when the last deal was done so obviously time has moved on and we have to recognize that reality
6274589 were looking to get a little piece of that in the future
6274590 it is a particular objective to make sure that there is a fair distribution of the burden if you like or the financial participation and thats not necessarily just directed at china

6274593 the hardest thing in baseball for a player is to get hurt

6274604 when it was discovered and for some years after that it was very low oil price environment
6274605 but with the last three or four years of strong oil prices and the movement of technology we see an oil field that is economic to develop
6274606 good design is not just about profit or beauty but creating social value
6274607 we envision people throwing tennis balls for their pets families coming and having picnics even kicking a soccer ball around
6274608 well encourage people to explore to get out off the main trail and go out in the woods
6274609 if we can encourage the growth of families then were doing exactly what we need to be doing

6274615 ontology is always a value proposition how a company makes money
6274616 a general purpose ontology gives us a framework to develop and discuss our own value propositions but those value propositions and their underlying ontologies must remain proprietary or else every company is just building to the lowest common denominator and innovation and value creation end
6274617 we are very excited to be signing to metal blade its as if a dream has come true for all of us we are very fortunate to be on a label with many bands that we have grown up listening to the only label we never thought we would be on is the label that we are now signed to haha we want to thank the entire metal blade staff especially brian slagel and mike faley for their interest in us it is a huge blessing for something of this magnitude to come to us at our age we can only thank god for his grace upon us we will be doing some touring here soon and recording november 1st 20th at the foundation in connersville indiana thank you

6274622 a couple of years back a mate of mine in la called me to say hed heard what he thought was my song on the radio and that he had been a bit shocked when he realized it was velvet revolver
6274623 when i checked it out myself i genuinely couldnt believe it because it wasnt as if it was close it was basically the same riff i called my publishers to check whether they knew anything which of course they didnt and then basically left it with them i never really expected to hear any more about it and was as surprised as anyone when i heard that universal had settled with velvet revolver
6274624 hell no how can you even ask me that ridiculous question after a whole year of doing nothing
6274625 in an online survey 42 percent of internet users admitted to
6274626 it seems highly unlikely that the firms had no understanding of what was happening in the ars market
6274627 continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6274628 the economy is probably going sideways with very little growth so people are gradually gravitating back toward energy and basic materials as safer places
6274629 we have a bigger bet on basic materials than we do on energy but essentially theyre trading the same
6274630 new measures will ensure air quality continues to improve after the games
6274631 another indication of the inexperience senator obama has in conducting foreign policy and maybe an indication of his inability to do so in a way that would be responsible

6274636 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6274637 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6274638 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6274639 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6274640 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6274641 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6274642 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6274643 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6274644 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6274645 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6274646 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6274647 a lei est l e vou sancionar ela n o sei quem foi que disse que eu ia vetar eu estou achando muito engra ado a capacidade de adivinha o das coisas que eu n o digo

6274678 what did you think was going to happen when you married him
6274679 oh my gosh theyre adopting so then theyre not just idiots who dont understand how conception works theyre doing this on purpose
6274680 how are you going to be able to send any of these kids to college
6274681 youre not getting any younger what if something happens to darrell
6274682 its time to bring the klan back and put black yellow and red people in those white suits
6274683 what was that thing you said that made me laugh so hard the other day whatever it was it sure was funny
6274684 olympic hopefuls and contestants spend most of their youth training and preparing to compete
6274685 some of them only get one chance and it is very rare to participate in more than two or three olympics to throw all this away by taking drugs is a personal tragedy
6274686 kids look up to athletes when they have to make decisions about how they are going to live their own lives they often make their choices based on what their heroes do
6274687 i made a small mistake in the first part of our routine
6274688 if i told you that i didnt want a medal but we did the best we could its been a great experience starting with the opening ceremonies forward and we still have the team competition coming up this weekend
6274689 most claim that their choice of asian kids which require tens of thousands in bribes to be paid to chinese officials unlike orphaned black kids right here and plentiful in every american state had nothing to do with racism but i had to laugh at how many of the letters claim that most or all black children suffer from drug and alcohol issues or at least their parents did people wheres the love
6274690 geez id be happy if youd just give back the ten bucks i wasted on your stupid movie
6274691 if a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the ninety nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off and if he finds it i tell you the truth he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety nine that did not wander off in the same way your father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost
6274692 once in the ring i demonstrated a talent for cheesing off large groups of drunken white people an absolute necessity for being a wrestling villain
6274693 were the good guys and theyre the bad guys so lets kick their tails
6274694 we are together no one feels threatened we are experiencing peace
6274695 its about the sadness of growing up and about a child that has an imaginary relationship with a dragon its about taking our place to make the world a more humane and peaceful place
6274696 the songs they were singing were traditional but had a fresh energy and perspective
6274697 it made me realize that i could take the songs that were important to me and give them a freshness and a vitality had it not been for my daughters exploration on the new perspective on folk music i dont think i would have considered doing the project it would have just been peter paul and mary without paul and mary now it is something special
6274698 it is symbolic of my daughter carrying on the music that i love
6274699 the night was fabulous i loved seeing people from my generation rocking out to peters music
6274700 i especially loved the incredibly important message of kindness in dont laugh at me
6274701 i really love his message that everyone is equal that it doesnt matter who you are or what you are that you should be who you are and accept who is different than you
6274702 he is into peace and social justice rights for everyone and i think it is important for quinn our adopted daughter to see people like him
6274703 i like peters message to just be yourself and remember that everyone is unique in their own way
6274704 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6274705 despite great progress tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of illness and death in victoria claiming around 4 000 lives causing 80 per cent of lung cancer cases and costing victorians around 5 billion every year

6274707 then i went to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6274708 for every one of his strides i have to go two and a half times faster
6274709 hes 6 5 and he runs like hes 5 9
6274710 how fast can one man go until you cant go any faster
6274711 thats what we call a phenomenon something you cant explain
6274712 he should not be allowed to open his mouth about anything
6274713 when we learned of the cut we got technicians on site as soon as we could
6274714 its a tough budget to put out but were proud of the our staff for working through this
6274715 to keep taxes the same there will be fewer paving projects which is unfortunate because every street in town needs work
6274716 when you look at the fact that some people living here have been laid off by trentonworks i dont think it would be prudent to ask them to foot the bill through increased taxes
6274717 the well of capital from the airport sale is slowly running dry
6274718 were counting on the province to get someone into trentonworks to help out but were not sitting on our hands either well have to find ways like the seniors centre and housing complex to make things work
6274719 tentatively we have a balanced budget but im not just going to take a budget as is i certainly want to review it in front of council
6274720 were not raising the tax rate so really a balanced budget is a discount with the increases we didnt have to raise the tax rate with all of the labour increases and fuel increases
6274721 every summer since our children were little we have come here to take their photo with humpty dumpty
6274722 its a tradition and a way for us to keep track of how much they have grown
6274723 i dont understand why someone would do such a thing
6274724 its not like we can just go down to the store and buy a new one its custom made
6274725 its not easily replaced it has sentimental value to me and all the children who visited it over the years
6274726 my wife found a nice digital camera on the side of the road while checking the ripeness of the berries along hatcherspass road in willow alaska looks like the camera was only used during special occasions and then stored in between shooting

6274757 bolt has made history he has broken a 12 year old record that was held by michael johnson and at the same time he crushed the 100 meter record
6274758 he added spirit to the sport he danced for us in the introduction he danced for us at the end he put on a show
6274759 i feel like him and athletics is like michael phelps and swimming he raised the bar for us

6274767 i n gauging the extent of the corporations cooperation the prosecutor may consider among other things whether the corporation made a voluntary and timely disclosure and the corporations willingness to provide relevant evidence and to identify the culprits within the corporation including senior executives
6274768 whereas natural persons may be given incremental degrees of credit for turning themselves in making statements against their penal interest and cooperating in the governments investigation of their own and others wrongdoing the same approach may not be appropriate in all circumstances with respect to corporations

6274866 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6274867 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6274868 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6274869 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6274870 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6274871 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6274872 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6274873 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6274874 its a very serious problem on college campuses and it just seems to get worse and worse
6274875 if theyre over there in iraq and have been shot at they may as well be able to have a beer when they get back home

6274877 in college youre free for the first time ever there are no rules
6274878 in high school there are rules and maybe its better to start drinking when there are rules

6274886 i think more than 500 students from south asia have been affected a good number of indian students have come here on education loans and find it difficult to buy expensive air tickets to visit their families this is why they have fallen prey to agents that offer very cheap tickets
6274887 one interpretation of these studies is that men are unable to ward off temptation we do not subscribe to this instead we believe men simply interpret these interactions differently than women do
6274888 we think that if men believed an attractive available woman was a threat to their relationship they might try to protect that relationship
6274889 were more expensive but thats because our cost structure is higher
6274890 many winners and people or companies that get great results or wind up on top simply stumbled into winning or lucked out he ignores the whole notion of how randomness plays the dip a listener writes
6274891 many winners and people or companies that get great results or wind up on top simply stumbled into winning or lucked out
6274892 well the to go charge is usually a dollar but since you come here a lot no charge for you

6274894 where have you been all my ti 83 4 silver edition titanium life
6274895 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
6274896 well what about cows maybe they live in the ocean
6274897 no cows jump over the moon and they eat grass and hay
6274898 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

6274900 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6274901 if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
6274902 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6274903 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6274904 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6274905 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6274906 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6274907 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6274908 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6274909 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6274910 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6274911 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
6274912 i think more than 500 students from south asia have been affected a good number of indian students have come here on education loans and find it difficult to buy expensive air tickets to visit their families this is why they have fallen prey to agents that offer very cheap tickets
6274913 there has been a lot of effort put into improving maths standards

6275068 our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the world powers against the world forces of this darkness against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places
6275069 once you file the flight plan and get the aeronautica office stamp on it its approved
6275070 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses
6275071 finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his might
6275072 put on the full armor of god that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil
6275073 therefore put on the full armor of god so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist with the breastplate of righteousness in place and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace in addition to all this take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god

6275077 believe in me and ill take care of the rest
6275078 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten or unique son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
6275079 carry to its perfect conclusion the work of your salvation for it is god who that he may carry out his own good pleasures brings to effect in you both the initial willing and the effective action
6275080 are we going to let the potter work on us or not
6275081 if it pleases the king may i have letters to the governors of trans euphrates so that they will provide me safe conduct until i arrive in judah and may i have a letter to asaph keeper of the kings forest so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence i will occupy
6275082 let no one lose heart on account of this philistine your servant will go and fight him

6275107 behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world
6275108 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
6275109 how long will you keep us in suspense if you are the christ tell us plainly
6275110 i told you and you do not believe i and the father are one
6275111 i showed you many good works from the father for which of them are you stoning me
6275112 for a good work we do not stone you but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself out to be god
6275113 if i do not do the works of my father do not believe me but if i do them though you do not believe in me believe the works that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i in the father
6275114 there is more evidence for the historical fact of the resurrection of jesus christ than for just about any other event in history
6275115 dont cook dont carry water dont walk over 400 yards etc
6275116 as he went along he saw a man blind from birth his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind

6275118 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up on the last day
6275119 flying into a black hole with a bag over your head
6275120 ive never noticed the droplets off the top of the waves before
6275121 and to think that they actually pay us to do this
6275122 a truck to drive back and forth to puerto lempira
6275123 look you guys need that airplane i want you to have it it needs to be used doing the kind of work that you all are doing im going to give it to you now and you pay me when you can
6275124 i have 2 500 for you toward a vehicle can you use it
6275125 we are buying a vehicle but its an airplane instead of a truck can we use the money for that
6275126 mr jack there is smoke coming out of your motor
6275127 lord if i am not going to make this take off safely please let me know before i get to the end of the runway
6275128 you dont really need brakes to fly this airplane has been without brakes for the last two months
6275129 no problems well except for the time i ran into the fence at the end of the runway in cauquira i got a little bit of barbed wire wrapped around the propeller but it was no big deal
6275130 julio if i ever find myself with this problem again what should i use if i dont have any hydraulic fluid
6275131 but if you drink two cold beers and then get into the airplane you wont worry about the brakes
6275132 what will this woman look like and how will i recognize her
6275133 its from laura the girl who cuts hair at the salon by the office
6275134 how convenient my parents and brothers are here i can introduce them today
6275135 why does she want to introduce me to her family
6275136 you had better pay attention because these could be your in laws
6275137 if he likes me fine lets move on and if not well on i go
6275138 dont you dare if it is the lords will it will happen
6275139 laura nobuko uyeda would you consent to be my wife
6275140 many daughters have done nobly but you excel them all
6275141 the most beautiful woman i had ever laid my eyes on
6275142 its just covering a hole that one of the kids made when they poked their pencil into the wing
6275143 you can begin to ask me for another airplane now
6275144 no lord i dont want to do that this one is just fine
6275145 no ask me for another airplane i want to give you another one
6275146 well i was playing golf today with a friend peter busch
6275147 36 000 to 40 000 is about the right price for this 18 year old twin engine airplane
6275148 well if i were you id consider selling the engines and propellers and any other parts that you can and get as much money out of it as you can its going to cost more to fix this airplane than its worth
6275149 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance
6275150 i heard about your problem with your airplane i want you to know that i will do anything that i can to help you
6275151 how nice that this chinese lady would be so thoughtful to offer her help but what can she do
6275152 yes i used to work for piper i was the engineer who did all the structural testing on the seneca
6275153 in orlando at a company that does structural repairs on airliners
6275154 lord i plead the blood of jesus on this airplane
6275155 i think weve got someone here that we can work with
6275156 anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
6275157 the effective prayer of a righteous man and woman can accomplish much
6275158 you know buddy that watch could finance our school project for almost a year
6275159 ive decided to sell this rolex watch and pay off the airplane bill
6275160 today i called a jeweler in miami and im going to take it down on thursday he said that he would give me 18 000 for it
6275161 last night someone gave a check to pay off the airplane
6275162 im going to sell it anyway and give the money to some other cause
6275163 i dont know why its happening but its great to see
6275164 theres no real reason for it but just guys seem to be more consistent
6275165 is seeing guys winning on teams below 500 not to take anything away from a guy like mike mussina but the yankees score so many runs guys like volquez lee cook and tim lincecum arent getting the support and theyre still winning
6275166 its fun admiring what these guys are doing right now
6275167 i hope they all do it but its so tough to get wins to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
6275168 last year i got worn down a little sometimes because i was too light
6275169 theyve got me eating good stuff vegetables and other good food
6275170 i think he would be successful if he was a center or a guard or a defensive tackle or a linebacker hes just a very unique guy
6275171 in 30 years of coaching i have had very few players who have had that kind of maturity and attitude or been that driven hes just very efficient
6275172 and we didnt know he would be like that i didnt even want to move him but i kept hearing from our defensive coaches that we didnt have any ends
6275173 it has been amazing especially since i was given only one scholarship offer
6275174 i think when i got here i felt like i had something to prove
6275175 i can get better at a lot of things my footwork my countermoves speed rushing
6275176 it was hard at first to make the adjustment to end the coaches told me to just come out and get off the ball quickly and just play
6275177 theyre going to start teeing off and being very aware of him
6275178 not in my experience a word second graders use a lot
6275179 the yamaha dd 6 features drum sounds assignable to any pad 100 pre programmed rhythm patterns and 4 assignable velocity sensitive drum pads the dd 6 has a single 1 4
6275180 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
6275181 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6275182 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6275183 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6275184 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6275185 this is as close as we are going to come to an nba playoffs or the nfl playoffs and when the playoffs come on i watch
6275186 for us this is what the season comes down to you dont play golf for the money but when you hear 10 million you kind of think about that and what a nice gift that would be im looking at this house in dallas right now that i maybe cant afford so im putting some pressure on myself to go get that house
6275187 after the majors are done theres a little bit of a downfall
6275188 but with these playoffs and the tour championship its kicked it up and its made it a little bit more interesting not only for us but also for the fans out there
6275189 i knew when i didnt win the first event last year i was toast
6275190 i dont know how its going to play out and only time will tell but this year theres going to be a lot more movement in the standings guys cant take a week off there are so many points out there
6275191 when the playoffs were first presented to us as players they said you know if you qualify for the playoffs at no
6275192 in its second year theres a bit better understanding of what the fedexcup is and what it entails and how to win and who can win
6275193 although i dont think anybody really understands the points fully we just know that if you play well youre going to do well and thats all that really matters so i think the fedexcup is gaining a lot of traction with the players padraig harrington who just won the last two majors and would love to take a bunch of time off but he cares about the playoffs hes here i think that speaks to how credible these events have quickly become
6275194 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6275195 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6275196 language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature
6275197 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6275198 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6275199 weve been winning like that all year long without certain guys in the lineup
6275200 the team is not built for one person to make it win its a team effort
6275201 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6275202 most us consumers are happy with dvds according to a recent study by abi research and dont believe blu ray provides as big of a quality jump as dvds did over vhs tapes
6275203 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6275204 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6275205 recap pelfrey throws first career complete game gets 12th win
6275206 what is a complete game weve never seen one of those before so we arent sure what it is
6275207 the seller with one unique item who is not a mass merchandise seller loses the edge again and the changes force them to look elsewhere for a selling platform
6275208 and ebay further deteriorates the reputation they had for finding anything you might be looking for on ebay so its not just the auction business theyre turning from they take away the unique array of items people would list
6275209 that said none of this means the bailout is a mistake
6275210 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
6275211 mediated how the media shapes your world and the way you
6275212 he made sure she suffered every single time he hit her
6275213 he could have killed her in a minute but he took hours
6275214 he wanted to be the man he was because he thought he could get away with it
6275215 hes asking for your sympathy and mercy he showed her jan none
6275216 he does not need to be executed for our society to feel safe
6275217 is that the king of thing we want to use to kill someone
6275218 a person who does this is not in their right mind
6275219 theres just too much evidence of his lewis jekyll and hyde behavior
6275220 rageful explosion of violence rather than a cold calculated murder
6275221 continue steadfastly in prayer being watchful in it with thanksgiving at the same time pray also for us that god may open to us a door for the word to declare the mystery of christ on account of which i am in prison that i may make it clear which is how i ought to speak
6275222 finally be strong in the lord and in the strength of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places therefore take up the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and as shoes for your feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace in all circumstances take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying at all times in the spirit with all prayer and supplication to that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all the saints and also for me that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains that i may declare it boldly as i ought to speak
6275223 finally brothers pray for us that the word of the lord may speed ahead and be honored as happened among you
6275224 pray for us for we are sure that we have a clear conscience desiring to act honorably in all things
6275225 to this end we always pray for you that our god may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power
6275226 as close as youll come to achieving the best of both worlds
6275227 how she would do as a vice president i dont know
6275228 i dont think shes got the overall experience he needs for a vice presidential candidate
6275229 i dont see anything at all in her background in what shes done that makes her a rising star in the democratic party other than being a woman
6275230 i havent seen a very dynamic speaker there i think shes dry as dust
6275231 ive heard her speak well but ive more often heard her not speak well she is just a little wooden
6275232 it is just devastating for the last five weeks i guess his family has virtually had to make a daily vigil with him against overwhelming odds
6275233 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
6275234 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
6275235 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
6275236 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
6275237 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
6275238 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
6275239 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6275240 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
6275241 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain
6275242 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6275243 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6275244 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a veronica movie
6275245 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6275246 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6275247 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6275248 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6275249 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6275250 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6275251 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6275252 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6275253 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6275254 i certainly wouldnt want to be outdoors today and especially with those bitterly cold winds blowing
6275255 its basically another cold front moving through bringing some pretty cold air continuing our wintery conditions
6275256 snow is going to happen mainly overnight as the coldest of the air move across the state were expecting it to fall as low as 500m mostly above 700m
6275257 that could include the dandenongs and a lot of the great divide
6275258 we could expect the hail in western and central areas later this afternoon and continuing tomorrow morning in central and eastern parts of the state
6275259 i would be guessing 5 15mm in the south and higher in the ranges
6275260 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
6275261 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
6275262 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
6275263 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
6275264 in all the discussion of john mccains recently recovered memory of a religious epiphany in vietnam one thing has been missing
6275265 according to the bush administrations definition of torture mccain was therefore not tortured
6275266 no war crimes were committed against mccain and the techniques used are according to the president tools to extract accurate information and so the false confessions that mccain was forced to make were according to the logic of the bush administration as accurate as the intelligence we have procured from interrogating terror suspects feel safer
6275267 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
6275268 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6275269 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6275270 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6275271 i would guess that these leases are pretty well picked over
6275272 you have a richer opportunity in a place that has not been previously developed
6275273 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6275274 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
6275275 i think people today have never looked so ugly in the whole history of the entire world
6275276 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
6275277 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good

6275280 the secretary came out and when she came out the guy was just speeding out of the cemetery driveway and thats when he collided with the deputys car and kept going along old stage road
6275281 one of the troopers spotted him he went up a path jumped out and ran
6275282 we used the 911 reverse and we had some neighbors call us we had a lot of help from the neighbors too and that made a big difference

6275286 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6275301 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room

6275305 socialmedian is raising some more angel investment now 25k 100 investor up to 500k interested parties can contact me directly
6275306 most venture financings are excluded from securities act registration via a private offering exemption but the key to these exemptions are that they arent disclosed publicly and the investors must all be high net worth individuals in other words this is exactly the kind of offering the law is designed to stop in order to protect individuals
6275307 i had no idea prior to 2006 it was illegal to have dogs in this environment then it made sense
6275308 in the food industry people need to remember not everybody is a dog person
6275309 theres a money issue you have to have a sanitary station its too much for me to be dog friendly
6275310 when i got it i said just another thing for the city of tampa to try to make a couple of extra bucks
6275311 maybe they dont know or maybe theyre concerned about patrons who dont want to eat with their neighbors dogs
6275312 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6275313 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6275314 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6275315 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6275316 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6275317 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6275318 the problem is we need to fix the system we have
6275319 if we introduce a parallel private system well be bringing more problems right now we dont have enough doctors or other health professionals to meet the needs of the current system
6275320 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6275321 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6275322 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show
6275323 the cma remains concerned that federal politicians are not addressing some of the key issues affecting health and health care
6275324 we have been trained and are dedicated to providing excellent care to our patients
6275325 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6275326 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6275327 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6275328 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6275329 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6275330 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6275331 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6275332 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6275333 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6275334 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6275335 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show
6275336 the cma remains concerned that federal politicians are not addressing some of the key issues affecting health and health care
6275337 we have been trained and are dedicated to providing excellent care to our patients
6275338 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6275339 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6275340 if that duplication of the gene may be five per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6275341 there was another severe poisoning that might have been fatal but mom also was very groggy so she stopped breastfeeding
6275342 so probably the baby was saved by not being breastfed
6275343 babies are much more sensitive to morphine than we thought in the past
6275344 we believe that should be a red flag from now on
6275345 so theres a lot of reason to rethink how we practise we need people to rethink it and especially if some babies may die from it thats totally unacceptable
6275346 my major concern with tylenol 3s are they actually provide minimal additional analgesic benefit
6275347 so if youre not providing additional pain relief why are you giving a compound that in one to two per cent of women looks as though it could be dangerous for their infant
6275348 i dont think it should be on the obstetrical unit formulary i think it should be withheld
6275349 it shouldnt provoke alarm among individual patients but it should provoke concern among professionals
6275350 youll be able to manipulate videos the way you manipulate pictures today
6275351 slaughter is just laughter with an s in front of it
6275352 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
6275353 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
6275354 i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge myth is more potent than history dreams are more powerful than facts hope always triumphs over experience laughter is the cure for grief love is stronger than death
6275355 you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams
6275356 i am so clever that sometimes i dont understand a single word of what i am saying
6275357 a friend is someone who will bail you out of jail but your best friend is the one sitting next to you saying that was f ing awesome
6275358 did i sit on the sidelines while the playing field burned

6275360 if youre this successful doing work you dont love what could you do with work you do love
6275361 i am going to be doing everything possible to ensure that this incumbent mayor is removed
6275362 he and the group that are in control of council have done a lot of damage to this city and its imperative that they be removed
6275363 we have just gone through an absolute development boom and we have the second highest tax rates in the metro vancouver region and we have had not one whit of any kind of a development in terms of amenities for the public
6275364 we have watched a whole boom take place and it has translated into absolutely no benefits for this community
6275365 hollywood hair is captured at last details in siggraph 2008 paper
6275366 by determining the orientations of individual hairs the researchers can realistically estimate how the hairstyle will shine no matter what angle the light is coming from
6275367 you cant just blend the highlights from two different angles to get a realistic highlight for a point in between
6275368 our method produces strands attached to the scalp that enable animation in contrast existing approaches retrieve only the visible hair layer
6275369 you will take that old tv in the den with you wont you the girls really want a new one thats cable ready and has a remote
6275370 it seems odd unless theyre catering to another segment that theyre hoping to please
6275371 obviously its a disappointment because these are important programs to our membership
6275372 any time a program is cut it means its going to impact on the ability of producers to do business and attract business to canada
6275373 some of russias actions were not proportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
6275374 dont ask us whos good and whos bad here we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war
6275375 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining

6275382 problemele legate de situa ia excep ional n jurul conflictului caucazian

6275387 conflictul din georgia a demonstrat c aceste conflicte nghe ate nu au un mecanism corect de deblocare a situa iei
6275388 conflictul transnistrean corespunde perfect cu ceea ce s a nt mplat n kosovo mai nainte i cu ceea ce s a nt mplat n osetia de sud acum am apreciat capacitatea rm de a nu r spunde la niciun fel de provoc ri din partea transnistrenilor rom nia este una din rile care nu au recunoscut kosovo consider nd c aceast decizie contravine legilor drepturilor interna ionale contravine principiilor integrit ii teritoriale i a inviolabilit ii frontierelor statelor

6275390 theres a reluctance a real touchy feeling about the election
6275391 people are uncomfortable having to make up their mind about voting for somebody black thats about where it is
6275392 im not a one way street i listen to everybody
6275393 mccains a good man he spent a lot of time in a prisoner of war camp and id love to vote for him just because of that but as for the rest of the issues i cant vote for him ill vote for obama
6275394 we dont have any candidates that can do the job
6275395 mccains too old hes older than i am and im too old and obama is too inexperienced and what about energy with all that money we spent in iraq couldnt we be energy independent by now if we had spent it for that instead
6275396 but i dont know the answer thats why i cut hair
6275397 i made a small mistake in the first part of our routine
6275398 if i told you that i didnt want a medal but we did the best we could its been a great experience starting with the opening ceremonies forward and we still have the team competition coming up this weekend

6275401 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth
6275402 we can really prove that theres no algorithm no way that the particle can give an answer that is unique and can be specified ahead of time
6275403 im still amazed that we can actually manage to prove that
6275404 a man on the street would say dont be ridiculous a natural feeling is of course that what we do we do of our own free will not completely but certainly to the point of knowing we can choose what button to push in an experiment
6275405 its kind of depressing when people cant communicate with each other
6275406 we know thats true in politics but youd think that wouldnt be going on here
6275407 as a determined determinist i would say that yes you bet an experimenters choice what to measure was fixed from the dawn of time and so were the properties of the thing he decided to call a photon
6275408 if you believe in determinism you have to believe it all the way no escape possible conway and kochen have shown here in a beautiful way that a half hearted belief in pseudo determinism is impossible to sustain
6275409 the most trustworthy indicator that an american college education is something worthwhile is that parents nationwide and even worldwide are eager to pay up to 180 000 to get one for their children
6275410 that when one of americas allies thinks it has a green light to invade somewhere they always do it in the summer
6275411 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
6275412 russia a country with 30 times the population of georgia decided to roll into its much smaller neighbour and tried to roll over it
6275413 it failed to roll over georgia but it would never have even thought of doing this if georgia were already a member of nato
6275414 we have been screwing up the ocean with plastic for 50 to 60 years the fact that weve done it so fast and that it has penetrated so low into the food chain is alarming but were just beginning to make a scientific assessment of what this means
6275415 this issue is so important and so relevant and so underreported
6275416 canary in the coal mine people should be concerned about the degradation of the aquatic system because if it goes life as we know it is going to go
6275417 mouse fish rat or human the mechanisms developed over hundreds of millions of years of evolution and are extremely similar across all vertebrates if they can be harmed so can we
6275418 negligible concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol a will result in fetal or neonatal mortality birth defects or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring
6275419 at exposure levels far in excess of those experienced by humans
6275420 this is 1 000 times higher than the ability of the cells to respond to this chemical there is clearly no safe amount
6275421 you dont have to have a phd or be a physician to know that estrogenizing males and blocking testosterone is going to wreak havoc
6275422 the ocean really needs us to embody a zero waste culture on land
6275423 thats the only way she is going to heal herself
6275424 i remain satisfied that mr dobell fulfilled his obligations with respect to managing potential conflict of interest and that the discussion he and i had and the procedure we agreed to effectively safeguarded the provinces interest
6275425 my message will be here im going to share my blueberries with you they were grown on the garden city lands you can grow food there and it already grows and for you to make a decision to remove these from farmland shows how corrupt the system really is

6275431 it has got all the branded cartoons of yesterday and today everything from scooby doo to snoopy to strawberry shortcake to the berenstain bears kind of headliners in their own right from the cartoon world
6275432 we believe we are now being heard and one day we will get independence tibetans are called separatists and uyghurs are called terrorists the international community must understand the difference between separatist terrorist and freedom fighter
6275433 what do we want human rights when do we want it now
6275434 the government of china has reiterated again and again that the human rights situation in both tibet and the xinjiang region have improved a great deal
6275435 there is no country in the world that is perfect in the human rights situation we admit that in china there might be some human rights issues but we will work on that they are not severe enough for those people to protest in front of the consulate i think those people are overdoing it they want to exaggerate it and attract more attention
6275436 they are trying to turn 2008 into a year of mourning and a year of terror
6275437 this incident that they are saying happened at this kashgar border crossing i think china has to show more proof
6275438 the onus should be on them because we know about manufactured trials in china and manufactured evidence if this was really a terrorist attack one report i heard was it was some disgruntled workers trying to make a payback everything in china seems to be used by china towards their own ends this is just used to try to justify a further crackdown in ur mqi and kashgar and places like that

6275441 mommies have eggs like chickens and daddies have sperm those were the ingredients you were made of
6275442 in fact honey you were born with all of your eggs theyre in your tummy right now
6275443 because its very grown up information and when youre more grown up ill tell you
6275444 well remember when we watched that movie national velvet and the horse was being born
6275445 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6275446 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6275447 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6275448 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6275449 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6275450 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6275451 if we have more mental health service more treatment i think that will solve a lot of problems in vancouver
6275452 to inhale exhale burn or carry a lighted cigarette cigar pipe hookah pipe or other lighted smoking equipment that burns tobacco or other weed or substance
6275453 it would appear that the definition was crafted to reflect the fact that irrespective of what is burned in a cigarette pipe or hookah pipe there are health risks to other occupants workers and patrons of the indoor space similar to the risks associated with the burning of tobacco
6275454 the province has said hey look if youre not burning tobacco were fine with that
6275455 the city of vancouver has focused on for whatever reason right or wrong that they want to put them out of business essentially
6275456 if we constantly say we want an investigation i think well get bogged down in the details of what happened in 9 11 when what happened in 9 11 is affecting us on a daily basis and a much deeper and comprehensive analysis is required to find out what is this process of militarization and how is fear used to control the population its far more important that we have a conversation about that
6275457 canadas war making in afghanistan is obviously directly tied to a perspective of what happened on september 11 2001 i dont have a lot of patience for wacky conspiracy theories and the wacky conspiracy told by the white house is too much to swallow wacky conspiracy theories ought to be met with examination and skepticism and this is a prime candidate for reexamination
6275458 twenty four canadians were killed in the world trade center theres been really no satisfactory prosecution of the perpetrators we owe it to those canadians and their families to find out what really happened theres a very long list of unanswered questions and theres every reason to believe that the government of the united states is withholding or suppressing evidence
6275459 we dont have any position that deals with that issue our main focus is as an antiwar organization our main argument against the war particularly in afghanistan is that its killing thousands of civilians were also demanding the right of the people in afghanistan to self determination to be able to control to their lives and country without foreign control and occupation
6275460 19 young arabs acting at the behest of islamist extremists headquartered in distant afghanistan
6275461 the main purpose of our group right now is we want to get a canadian investigation into 9 11 in order to justify our war effort
6275462 if we dont have a reason we should pull out immediately
6275463 theyre very important for society because after an event like that just like the jews with the holocaust or the palestinian problem theres so much emotion involved that you need people that are going to kind of commemorate them the victims
6275464 because it was something that was so new and unexpected people cannot grasp the idea that a plane hit a building and the building collapsed that it can be that simple because it had so many implications and effects on our everyday life
6275465 but thats the way we mythologize these kinds of events and make meaning out of them
6275466 trilateralism at an end asymmetrical bilateralism restored canadian ambivalence on u s strategic primacy after 9 11
6275467 greatly increased u s demands for historically unprecedented bilateral cooperation in both military operations and national security surveillance and enforcement
6275468 to the extent that canadians have begun to share fears about a decline in world order and global security as well as a decline in relative american power the willingness to align canadian foreign and defense policies more closely with washington actually may increase
6275469 with troops in afghanistan but none in iraq canadian audiences could be told that ottawa was standing up against american pressures while american officials could be mollified by the sacrifice of money and lives in afghanistan
6275470 scientific and eyewitness evidence shows that the 9 11 commission report is a fraudulent document and that those behind the report are consciously or unconsciously guilty of covering up what happened on 9 11 2001
6275471 because it was something that was so new and unexpected people cannot grasp the idea that a plane hit a building and the building collapsed that it can be that simple
6275472 did i stutter son what are you slow or something
6275473 expect me to speak vietnamese not korean i eat ph not

6275480 with all the fuss about police profiling can you imagine what would happen if this sort of thing were on a cop web site
6275481 federal lawsuit alleges that wells fargo amp co uses the internet to discriminate against minority home lenders and encourage racial segregation
6275482 its a new test sunderland are a team we think are small but they are looking to progress with this signing they have given me a lot of scope to have a good season
6275483 one thing is for sure there is a lot of potential
6275484 from the first match djibril didnt feel that his place was assured and it affected him at that moment the idea of leaving came back to him
6275485 i asked him to be patient but in the last match against auxerre last weekend where he was subbed he had made his mind up that he would not be staying i didnt want to go against his wishes
6275486 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6275487 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6275488 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6275489 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad

6275497 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6275498 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6275499 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs

6275507 saya amat memahami akibat bersumpah dengan nama allah jika ia tidak benar atau satu ciptaan saya atau mana mana pihak maka saya akan dilaknat ditimpa mala petaka serta bencana kepada diri saya keluarga serta keturunan saya selama lamanya
6275508 secara kebetulan saja kalau nak ikutkan saya pun tak tahu anwar akan bertanding saya buat laporan pada 28 jun lalu saya pun tak tahu bila dia akan bertanding
6275509 selama ini saya mencari kekuatan mental dan rohani allah telah beri kekuatan kepada saya pada hari ini iaitu jumaat hari yang sangat dirahmati allah
6275510 it was a stupid move by him mohd saiful and what made it worse was that it involved those who use the name of islam
6275511 swearing on the quran is not in keeping with the demands of islamic law what we have in islam is lian swearing involving married couples swearing on the holy book is a practice of christians who swear on the bible
6275512 for muslims it is lian which is the case of a man accusing his wife of having illicit sex but anwar and mohd saiful are not husband and wife
6275513 why did he do it swear on the eve of the permatang pauh by election nominations it is clear that a dirty political game is being played
6275514 i believe in anwars innocence and i am confident more will vote for him after seeing all this happening
6275515 this swearing on the quran is not a laughing matter i think it is time for him anwar to respond perhaps in the same way
6275516 he must do it if he wants to clear his name
6275517 saya yakin mohd saiful telah menjalani proses mengangkat sumpah secara tertib mengikut apa yang disyariatkan dalam islam
6275518 ini termasuklah diadakan di dalam masjid pada hari jumaat dalam keadaan suci berwuduk berkiblatkan kaabah serta mengucapkan lafaz wallahi wabillahi dan watallahi
6275519 kerana itu saya mencabar mereka yang mengkritik mohd saiful untuk tampil menunjukkan cara yang betul bagi membuktikan kaedah yang digunakan oleh anak saya adalah salah katanya
6275520 saya minta mereka berhenti mempersoalkan perkara remeh sedemikian kerana anak saya telah mengangkat sumpah dengan cara yang betul di sisi islam bukan dengan pegangan agama lain
6275521 yang penting keikhlasan dan keberanian beliau untuk menjalani proses itu tanpa keraguan jadi hentikanlah mengkritik ujarnya
6275522 jika saya berdusta saya sanggup menerima azab dilaknat dan kutukan daripada allah sehingga kiamat
6275523 jika anwar juga bersumpah laknat seperti itu mohd saiful maka jadilah mubahalah dan kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti
6275524 in islam anyone can swear that they are telling the truth but they do not have to hold the quran
6275525 its just a gimmick i dont think it is right for saiful to do especially so now that the case is in court one cannot do something that could influence the outcome of a case this is certainly on the verge of contempt
6275526 no matter how many times he swears if the doctor checks and says there is nothing wrong his oath cannot be used do not play around with the name of allah do not degrade our religion
6275527 saya jumpa pegawai jawi ada hal sikit saya akan maklumkan jika ada perkembangan

6275553 for a human to catch it there must be an extreme set of circumstances involving a sick horse
6275554 infected horses typically develop a respiratory illness and all three humans who have died have had intense extremely close contact with these horses and are exposed to the mucous in the same way a parent catches a bug off a sick child theyre caring for
6275555 were not talking just walking past a stable with an infected horse these are vets and farmers people who have stayed with the horse often through the night and caught the virus by breathing it in
6275556 based on this principle i believe the same should apply to national type schools which should be accorded the same treatment as national schools
6275557 i agree this point can be debated peacefully in parliament and not be done with force like the way it was done at the bar council forum
6275558 we cannot use violence even if we disagree with anothers view even if it is a minority view
6275559 they have been invoking article 18 on universal human rights which allows for anyone to leave his or her faith this is against islam
6275560 this kind of stand is obviously going to hurt muslim lawyers
6275561 people tell me it is a magic swimming pool because swimmers broke so many world records in these past few days
6275562 it may not appear stunning at first sight but if you take a second look you will feel peace and a profound sense of beauty
6275563 even your competitors understand how much hardship you have to endure to finish a mega project like that

6275568 se ha rumoreado la suspensi n del partido pero no sabemos si ten a una base seria o era todo una especulaci n
6275569 fuimos superiores en la segunda parte pero dinamarca fue mejor en la primera hemos salido lentos parsimoniosos pero tras el descanso hemos sido mejores ante una buena selecci n
6275570 me he encontrado c modo he tenido la m xima colaboraci n de todos y de los jugadores y por ello s estoy feliz

6275575 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6275576 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6275577 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6275578 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6275579 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6275580 no me he econtrado bien desde los primeros metros pero he sufrido tanto que ten a que luchar ten a que trabajar durante una hora y media despu s de llevar tanto tiempo sufriendo y no me pod a venir abajo
6275581 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6275582 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6275583 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6275584 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs
6275585 i asked to play against the czechs for this reason to know where the problems are
6275586 i see that when we play against a team that waits for us and counterattacks it is not easy to score
6275587 i saw a lot of things that i had doubts over but i think we are ready for the next game
6275588 we were controlling the game for the whole of the second half
6275589 if we had scored again we would have been the winners of this match but england is a very strong team and plays until the last minute
6275590 i am calling from the last house on the road i wanted to tell you that there is a lot of water that is coming from your house down the road it all pools up outside our house
6275591 oh is it i have just now come back from hospital i didnt know can i have your number i will find out and call you back
6275592 i am mrs n 1 i spoke to my servants they are saying they have not used any water but they use so much water what to do every month my bills are so high
6275593 well maybe if you didnt hose down your driveway your bills wont be so high
6275594 it is paved no sand gets between the cracks we have to clean it with a hosepipe otherwise it will look dirty but nowadays we are doing it only once a week
6275595 actually my real problem is those trees on the road
6275596 they make the road so dark and they keep dropping leaves all over my garden my servant has to sweep it three four times a day its such a nuisance
6275597 leaves are bio degradable that should be the least of your problems
6275598 no no i dont like it i wish i could cut off all the trees then my garden will look nice
6275599 this is not an ideal scenario it should be the boards who make this call not the players
6275600 we are not proposing to do any more until we hear from them
6275601 we are confident that the icc has got a very clear understanding of what the views are around not just australia but a number of senior icc member nations
6275602 we would like to have hosted sydney at home in the opening round so we could unfurl the championship flag but circumstances have meant that couldnt happen
6275603 thats the first game ive played since october last year in germany
6275604 they were always going to execute better than us down the stretch
6275605 i was always concerned if the game was going to be close
6275606 but winning needs to be a culture im not happy we didnt get the win
6275607 we tried a lot of different combinations and there were certainly patches that were very good
6275608 we wanted to push the ball in transition and we were doing that but im disappointed we didnt close out the game better
6275609 its not a matter of size its a matter of skill
6275610 i would love to fight mundine he says he wants to take on the best middleweights 72kg in the world but lets see how he goes against a junior welterweight 64kg first
6275611 in terms of skill i would give him a boxing lesson
6275612 ive sat on it this long ive waited my hearts set on coming over here ive had a taste of it with trials and i love it so im definitely staying
6275613 hopefully i did enough against south africa to keep conversations going and seal something i just have to hold on tight and see what comes theres been a lot of chat and what not but hopefully i can turn that into a deal soon
6275614 obviously id rather have a club but ive learnt over the past few months that patience is a virtue
6275615 i have to be patient and i will be rewarded in the end
6275616 i dont just want to sign somewhere for the sake of signing i want to make sure i do the right thing
6275617 we are looking elsewhere if i came anywhere near england it would have to be a loan deal which makes it difficult
6275618 i think maybe missing out on the world cup squad was something i took not hard but it was a big disappointment to me
6275619 i think everyone you see that plays rugby has a disappointment in their career they dont make a team they dont make a squad
6275620 that was something that i sort of sat down after and sort of said look its now or never not now or never but its time for me to step up
6275621 it was clean slate everyone was on a new piece of paper
6275622 obviously discipline was a part of my game that i lacked
6275623 i tended to have brain explosions or brain snaps where id do something stupid that probably at the time i thought was a good idea but you look back and it wasnt
6275624 so that was something that i have worked pretty hard on not actually physically doing anything but logically in my head trying to work that out
6275625 i just sort of said if it seems stupid at the time its probably not a good idea to do it
6275626 you can overcomplicate rugby it is just a game after all and you just go out there and do what you do do what you can do and do it to your best ability and thats all ive been really trying to do and robbie hasnt tried to change anything
6275627 i sort of went into this super 14 season wanting to play my best for the reds and hopefully that would sort of continue into a squad
6275628 when i first got called up it was something that was a pleasing surprise and each week has just been an added bonus to me but each week i want to make the best of my opportunities and now that im here i definitely dont want to give it up
6275629 each guy can do a job when theyre there weve got guys that arent in the squad that could definitely do the job and if i get given the opportunity i plan to do it to the best of my ability and do it as well as i can so that next week im still there with the job
6275630 i think weve got a very young bunch of guys there but theres a group of guys that want to be there and want to play and have the ability to play well
6275631 i think thats something that weve probably lacked in queensland a little bit self belief and i think to bring those young guys to have a bit of self belief to show that they can mix it with the likes of the other big super 14 franchises is going to be a challenge but it will be enjoyable
6275632 cmon you gotta at least call and see if they are ok
6275633 self they were so over you and your family they didnt want to help you then so you shouldnt give a damn now
6275634 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6275635 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6275636 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6275637 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6275638 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6275639 i hope they take good care of ed mcmahon because he deserves it the only reason anybody other than me would be interested in this house is because i showed an interest in it first
6275640 i just heard that the person negotiating doesnt have financing and the deal would be subject to getting financing something which i obviously dont need
6275641 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6275642 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6275643 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6275644 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6275645 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6275646 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6275647 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6275648 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6275649 its a very serious problem on college campuses and it just seems to get worse and worse
6275650 if theyre over there in iraq and have been shot at they may as well be able to have a beer when they get back home
6275651 the political popularity of federal highway money far outweighs the popularity of letting 18 year olds drink
6275652 in college youre free for the first time ever there are no rules
6275653 in high school there are rules and maybe its better to start drinking when there are rules
6275654 a lot of people get a real thrill out of the fact its illegal that causes them to drink more
6275655 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6275656 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6275657 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6275658 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic
6275659 so sold out that microsoft japan actually put out an official statement about the situation in the land of the rising sun apologizing for the lack of consoles since demand has eclipsed supply microsofts supply has gone totally dry the company is ramping up production and the console will not be shipped to stores until next month
6275660 this isnt against us its part of a new global game
6275661 the aircraft carrier to syria is supposed to show that russia has allies and that it wants access to the mediterranean israel as a western state is merely one player in this global realignment russia is signalling in the strongest possible way that it is willing to activate its old soviet military alliances
6275662 today russias interest is to show the us and the west that it is a superpower again its back in the mediterranean its telling the west you need us in this region and you need us to deal with iran this is happening because it senses that the west is weak
6275663 as far as assad is concerned his new found russian friends could provide a deterrent against a future attack on syria
6275664 pakistan has done problematic things without any connection to arms sales to india such as the proliferation of nuclear know how to iran which has been going on for many years
6275665 we know that the pakistani government was not completely in the dark over pakistani nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khans nuclear smuggling network in this sense pakistan has been maneuvering in a way that has harmed this area irrespective of the indian connection
6275666 we didnt really have a sense of what was going on out there we knew there was a potential for a problem
6275667 the state has that evidence now or i believe they do
6275668 the u s and polish governments have begun formal negotiations on the proposal u s assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation john c rood is leading those negotiations with poland our goal remains to conclude negotiations by the fall of 2007
6275669 the real difference is that we have the moral high ground russia is an autocracy aspiring to annex its neighbors with military force
6275670 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6275671 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6275672 protect the us from missile threats from the middle east
6275673 initially the missile defense shield was supposed to be constructed to
6275674 indeed russia has long been told to simply accept the facts heres the independence of kosovo for you heres the abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty and the american decision to place missile defenses in neighboring countries heres the unending expansion of nato all of these moves have been set against the backdrop of sweet talk about partnership why would anyone put up with such a charade
6275675 the children are out there fighting togetehr on the field and you are not there to help them
6275676 your presence is not longer needed or wanted outside your own borders
6275677 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6275678 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6275679 in the nba you are just kind of an employee you are just there
6275680 at all times you are vulnerable to something that could happen to you you dont know where you will be the next day you might be off to another city
6275681 it was kind of like being stuck between a rock and hard spot
6275682 with the clippers there were no guarantees and now instead of being available to only one team i am available to 29 more
6275683 ive got faith in my agent that he will put in the best possible situation
6275684 if i had to go to europe its not the end of the world
6275685 you can look at it as a positive you would get a chance to experience a whole new country and get a whole different culture but my goal has always been to play in the nba so that is what i am focused on
6275686 i think there are a lot of real good basketball fans in reno
6275687 while we welcome and encourage spirited public debate about appropriate standards of behavior we do not support policies that would have the effect of encouraging or making it more likely that younger citizens would use alcohol or drugs
6275688 will create problems for a whole other set of kids
6275689 on the issue of changing the drinking age this is not a parade i want to lead
6275690 theres clearly a problem with binge drinking on college campuses
6275691 but you dont fix that by giving up and going back to age 18
6275692 binge drinking is not a problem at spelman college however it has become a major problem on many campuses in higher education
6275693 i stand in solidarity with my presidential colleagues who seek to open the debate on how the problem can be addressed more effectively
6275694 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6275695 people are going to do what they want to do but is it a good idea to encourage it
6275696 there have been no human cases of west nile virus yet this season
6275697 a case of west nile virus provides an urgent reminder to protect ourselves
6275698 wear mosquito repellent whenever you are outdoors and long sleeves and pants in the morning and evening
6275699 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6275700 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6275701 i hope it can serve as a model for other servicers
6275702 my band is the next big thing and we want to know if youll give us some free studio time to show you
6275703 im a professional musician and studio owner not a professional driver
6275704 the day off would probably do me good right now but im still going to have a crack at it hopefully the adrenalin will kick in tomorrow and i wont be able to feel it
6275705 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun one that can be purchased at wal mart on campus that can shoot plastic bbs
6275706 were not going to have any comment until that process is complete
6275707 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6275708 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing
6275709 some persons have placed desks in the road and placed a vast amount of liquor on them for everyone to drink and be merry it is just like carnival down here
6275710 there will be a massive street dance in his home community of sherwood content later tonight
6275711 we are also getting a committee together to plan a big home coming celebration for whenever usain decides to come home
6275712 miscarriage birth defects and other harrowing topics its not your fault except when it is you selfish ignorant pregnant dumbass
6275713 no not even a hot shower i was told to take cold showers during my whole pregnancy

6275715 i will rend you from the inside out i will rape you and spread your soul open for the birds to pick clean you will be mistaken for the flood dead in the creek
6275716 let me call my sister to keep the children from coming home please please

6275722 well at least i didnt miss a shot from point blank range
6275723 yeah huh go for it shoot me right in the fuckin face
6275724 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6275725 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity
6275726 i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future we have achieved a lot over the past three years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6275727 the organisation is in better financial health than ever and i am also delighted to have seen the recent launch of the respect programme which is very important to me
6275728 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success while i also believe the plans for the national football centre will benefit english football in the long term
6275729 the team is looking real good my goal this season is just to be a good leader i want to lead on the field off the field and in the classroom more importantly i want to be a leader to my teammates stats are nice but they are unpredictable besides i always want to do better than the goals i set
6275730 no question about it playing in all those passing tournaments really helped out we all now have a better feel and rhythm with our quarterback drew little we have great timing the thing is what we run during the summer is what we run in the fall
6275731 i will visit stanford 11 15 when they play usc and i will visit ucf 9 6 when they play usf i also like alabama clemson auburn and florida
6275732 i love the academics and athletics of stanford they are bringing in some great recruits i mean some great players are headed their way
6275733 i love coach brent keys and coach david kelly at ucf i loved it there when i visited as well i have a great bond with everyone there i feel the school is underrated and so is the conference usa they produce some great players
6275734 i was at alabama just two saturdays ago i went and saw chris jackson and a scrimmage there they are young and have some great young players
6275735 i love that style of offense at clemson everyone thinks they run so much because of c j spiller and james davis they do run but they throw so much its a great offense for receivers
6275736 i like the new offense at auburn i saw a scrimmage that opened my eyes a lot i was done there a few weeks ago
6275737 florida is great school overall i like them and their style of offense they are losing some wide receivers and i can come in and compete for a spot
6275738 yeah i didnt pen a single word from any of our songs
6275739 in fact i cant even sing but i can lip sync
6275740 yes i was in the restroom with george michael that day
6275741 luckily i got out of there before that cop arrived would have hated to see my career go the way of wham
6275742 i mean they had to bring in hugh mccracken and jerry ricks to cover my ass on guitar i was so bad
6275743 but thankfully mr hall decided to stick with me because he said having a group just named hall sounded kinda dumb i told him if he kept me around id keep my yap shut and make him a star
6275744 excuse me but i noticed you amp i have the same man woman on our page amp i was just wondering how do you know him her
6275745 we are together no one feels threatened we are experiencing peace
6275746 its about the sadness of growing up and about a child that has an imaginary relationship with a dragon its about taking our place to make the world a more humane and peaceful place
6275747 the songs they were singing were traditional but had a fresh energy and perspective
6275748 it made me realize that i could take the songs that were important to me and give them a freshness and a vitality had it not been for my daughters exploration on the new perspective on folk music i dont think i would have considered doing the project it would have just been peter paul and mary without paul and mary now it is something special
6275749 it is symbolic of my daughter carrying on the music that i love
6275750 the night was fabulous i loved seeing people from my generation rocking out to peters music
6275751 i especially loved the incredibly important message of kindness in dont laugh at me
6275752 i really love his message that everyone is equal that it doesnt matter who you are or what you are that you should be who you are and accept who is different than you
6275753 he is into peace and social justice rights for everyone and i think it is important for quinn our adopted daughter to see people like him
6275754 i like peters message to just be yourself and remember that everyone is unique in their own way
6275755 we never said we were going to donate money for the campaign
6275756 we paid for the hall and the entertainers and the surplus we said would be spent on advertisements aimed at persuading nigerians to tell their relatives in america to register to vote
6275757 there is not one nigerian who doesnt have a relative or friend in america our aim was to encourage those people to tell their family who have the right to vote in america to vote for obama
6275758 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6275759 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing

6275763 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6275764 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity
6275765 i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future we have achieved a lot over the past three years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6275766 the organisation is in better financial health than ever and i am also delighted to have seen the recent launch of the respect programme which is very important to me
6275767 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success while i also believe the plans for the national football centre will benefit english football in the long term

6275784 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6275785 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6275786 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6275787 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6275788 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6275789 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6275790 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6275791 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6275792 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6275793 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6275794 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6275818 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6275819 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6275820 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6275821 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6275822 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6275823 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6275824 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6275825 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6275826 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6275827 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6275828 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6275829 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6275830 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6275831 i think a lot of the residents myself included have some major concerns about security about pollution about noise pollution because theres no way to buffer the sound in an area thats noted for being quiet
6275832 if it turns out that these impacts that we are concerned about cannot be mitigated than the town planning board should not approve this project
6275833 i think for those of us who see big problems were trying to slow down the process and at the very least make sure that we go through the whole thing so that we all understand exactly what the negatives and the positives are before anything is affirmatively done

6275858 que son nuestros hermanos y para el gobierno es un buen avance para que no est n al margen del cambio que favorece a los sectores sociales vulnerables
6275859 esperamos que ahora se discuta la aplicaci n efectiva de la ley en concertaci n con el sector y cese el conflicto que lastima

6275876 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6275877 the plan today is to use an inflatable sling to try to get the whale further out to sea where he might hook up with another pod of whales
6275878 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6275879 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales
6275880 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
6275881 we must try to save this baby whale to do nothing is not an option we are happy to build a tourism industry around these beautiful creatures and now the time has come to pay it forward
6275882 the most humane thing though it is a terribly sad thing would be to put it down there is no point in prolonging its suffering in the foolish and arrogant presumption that we could save its life

6276000 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6276001 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6276002 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative

6276008 everything about the wendy preview clicked for our stations from conception to promotion to hitting the air
6276009 it completely broke the mold the show is now a proven winner and we cant wait to see it debut across the country next year
6276010 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6276011 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6276012 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6276013 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6276014 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6276015 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6276016 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6276017 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6276018 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6276019 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6276020 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6276021 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6276022 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6276023 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6276024 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6276025 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6276026 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6276027 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6276028 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6276029 why does this agency think its okay to keep playing russian roulette with childrens lives
6276030 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6276031 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6276032 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6276033 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6276034 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6276035 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive

6276041 we do not have a copy of the course paper you requested and neither does columbia university
6276042 a thesis entitled soviet nuclear disarmament written at the height of the cold war in 1983 might shed some light upon what barack obama thought about our most pressing foreign policy issue for 40 plus years u s soviet relations
6276043 you wouldnt say oh hes going to be secretary of state or president someday
6276044 clearly one of the top one or two students in the class
6276045 my recollection is that the paper was an analysis of the evolution of the arms reduction negotiations between the soviet union and the united states
6276046 at that time a hot topic in foreign policy circles was finding a way in which each country could safely reduce the large arsenal of nuclear weapons pointed at the other for u s policy makers in both political parties the aim was not disarmament but achieving deep reductions in the soviet nuclear arsenal and keeping a substantial and permanent american advantage as i remember it the paper was about those negotiations their tactics and chances for success barack got an a
6276047 the course was not a polemical course it was a course in decision making and how decisions got made
6276048 it wasnt a position paper it was an analysis of decision making
6276049 at the time barack obama was a student the political science department had no mechanism by which undergraduate political science majors in columbia college could receive recognition for writing an independent thesis
6276050 the departments procedures for students to write theses were created in the 1990s
6276051 senator obama did not write a thesis in fact columbias political science department didnt even begin offering the option for college undergraduates to write independent credit theses until the 1990s well after obama had graduated
6276052 if obama says he doesnt have a copy i would have to call him a liar
6276053 obama has it or knows where it is but no one has pressed him seriously for it
6276054 its not chris fault he just didnt know any better

6276061 we have such an incredibly strong pool of applicants and we know we have limited space in the fall we wanted to provide an opportunity for a limited number of students in the winter it helps us better manage enrollment
6276062 most people to take some time off after high school to make sure you have your priorities straight
6276063 it has become a great way to get kids willing and able to think outside the box who are willing to be flexible
6276064 some of the students may be at more risk academically and they might be more at risk socially since they are entering school at a time friendships and relationships already have been established
6276065 theres always a group of students every year we couldnt admit for space reasons in the fall but just couldnt turn away they are too much of a good fit to turn away
6276066 graduate at comparable rates and really become a part of the student body with little challenge

6276085 almost every assault of any kind is related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6276086 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6276087 we really dont understand the rationale behind dropping a bike trail for environmental issues when theyre already running a big highway through there
6276088 as environmental planners theyre concerned about environmental impacts not necessarily whether a bike path serves its intended purpose
6276089 its their duty to build a transportation facility that accommodates all vehicles not just automobiles
6276090 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6276091 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6276092 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6276093 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6276094 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6276095 its a very serious problem on college campuses and it just seems to get worse and worse
6276096 if theyre over there in iraq and have been shot at they may as well be able to have a beer when they get back home
6276097 the political popularity of federal highway money far outweighs the popularity of letting 18 year olds drink
6276098 in college youre free for the first time ever there are no rules
6276099 in high school there are rules and maybe its better to start drinking when there are rules
6276100 a lot of people get a real thrill out of the fact its illegal that causes them to drink more

6276104 what we need are checks and balances the rule of law and an independent judiciary without that there will be no way to keep the corrupt politicians in line
6276105 the army had lost peoples respect and now it has done the right thing to win it back
6276106 this is a golden opportunity for the politicians but if they mess up again it may not last long

6276109 everyone knows where mr oei is hes not hiding out if he were indicted and told about it he would have gone in
6276110 the timing raises questions why the public spectacle mr oei is a responsible person and he intends to fight these charges because theyre wrong
6276111 well go straight to court and were going to pound this charge into the ground
6276112 we just feel very strongly that this is not someone who should be in the loudoun county school system
6276113 were examining the situation and deciding the course of action
6276114 at this point were weighing what options we have we have to make decisions that reflect everybodys best interests
6276115 if this was a matter of a photo that he possessed and maintained solely for the purpose of executing his job as vice principal we would not be interested in prosecuting him that is not the case
6276116 hes always been very pleasant the kids seem to respond well to him and the parents everyone likes him
6276117 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6276118 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6276119 this is a de facto acknowledgement that the work cannot be finished before the start of school
6276120 but there were some inevitable problems that were bound to arise given the decades of neglect of many of these buildings the administration is the first to admit that there is much more to do

6276245 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6276246 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6276247 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6276248 a disastrous overblown folly the moment when oasis their judgement clouded by drugs and blanket adulation ran aground on their own sky high self belief

6276255 we have a friend named celestin who grew up in rwanda during the genocide when about a million people were mercilessly killed in the middle of that madness celestin became a pastor and felt god calling him to teach tribal reconciliation to the hutus and tutsi during the conflict forgiveness wasnt very fashionable and he landed on the hit list of both tribes because he called them to repent of their violence he was beaten again and again and saw some of his closest friends tortured and killed at times he was angry confused heartbroken but he never ceased preaching about the nonviolent jesus in december 1998 militants came into the village and killed more than seventy people in celestins congregation and village including celestins father and yet he continued to preach the gospel of reconciliation with blood on all sides eventually one of the relatives of the soldiers who killed celestins church members surrendered his life to christ put down the sword and took up the cross now that person is caretaker for celestins aging mother as an act of repentance thats the gospel of grace
6276256 i saw with my own eyes the sibyl at cumae hanging in a jar and when the boys said sibyl what do you want

6276260 rainier cant save you now not that the sun is up and even the moon herself is hiding
6276261 you have no idea what youre getting yourself into do you
6276262 its not bad enough that my boyfriend was killed by demons im getting the help of a vampire to bring him back to hell and a devil horse wanted to eat me no there have to be fucking faery secretaries
6276263 do you think you could maybe repeat it one more time for me rainier because i still could swear that what youre telling me is that were about to rob a grave
6276264 its hardly a grave persephone more of a tomb a mausoleum
6276265 you think that just because youre going to die in forty or fifty years you need to run around like youll just drop dead of the plague at any minute then you have the audacity to assume that means you can make other people run around in just the same manner
6276266 what the hell sort of self respecting vampire has a
6276267 it comes in handy and its easier to carry around in my pocket than a torch is
6276268 or maybe it should be for the villagers coming to kill you for ravaging their daughters
6276269 did you just refer to a corpse as a payload
6276270 we go in get out leave and i faint you take me home like the creepy stalker you are and all is well
6276271 i feel your hand on my arm a little painful by the way
6276272 use your senses something other than sight i suppose since you dont seem to be inclined to see anything unless it reveals itself to you thats not an insult
6276273 its just truth try closing your eyes smell the air taste it listen for something
6276274 you needed a push and something thats strong enough for even you to catch youve always been on the threshold of being able to sense these things a lot of people are and i just gave you a quick push through
6276275 you could stop i suppose though i hardly see why you might find that to your benefit
6276276 im sure jason will agree to it especially since changing your religion wont do shit for stopping all of this from existing
6276277 she could not carry it she is not the one
6276278 shes determined to go to hell and you and i know that she needs the instrument to do it
6276279 will i ever not have to do that and look like a dog
6276280 there are types of magic that have long since died out things that most people dont hear about let alone practice
6276281 what you did was that you would sacrifice the child or an animal that had done some great service to you first you would explain to them the situation tell them that what they were about to receive was a great honor and the children understood it more often than not because they made for better guardians that way then you would sacrifice them and bury their spirit below the threshold of a home or any sort of building really something just beginning to be built youd bind the spirit to that place and depending on how strong the spirit or your binding the spirit would protect the building with varying strength sometimes something just as small as keeping spirits of bad luck away
6276282 they killed the children and the pets as a reward what the hell sort of bullshit is that
6276283 some people thought living for an eternity was a great boon
6276284 some people thought that dieing for their village for that which they loved was a great honor
6276285 it is orpheus had the power to sway anyone with his music if he truly put his mind to it normal mortals however especially now that the power in their blood has been so diluted by time they need help this violin can tame cerberus lull the beast to sleep so you can pass into hell
6276286 it means any number of things really some god has decided that youre meant to do something that may or may not come to pass
6276287 theres not much i can tell you so far as that goes the gods do things for reasons beyond my ken and quite frankly id rather it stay that way i could however teach you how to see things that dont simply reveal themselves to you its greatly helpful a thing to know how to do peering into the world that resides above and beside this one
6276288 i was the hall monitor it was my job to look after my classmates
6276289 remember that one time our bus overheated and we were stranded in the countryside of rwanda for several hours
6276290 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6276291 everything i ever needed to know i learned at camp
6276292 everything i ever need to know i learned at mtc specifically at holly springs summer school
6276293 and i know it hurts but im glad that you feel better now
6276294 if i just hide thats not a life running and hiding like some scared rabbit ready to dive into some hole at any given moment they hurt jason i cant be scared
6276295 whats a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this
6276296 i think i have a way to start if nothing else
6276297 i will though i suppose i couldnt tell you why there will be a fee of course there is always a price
6276298 before i help though i need to know this do you truly want me to
6276299 why would i come here a second time no less if i didnt want help
6276300 think about it think about it objectively harder than you have before do you really want this for me to help you do you want to bring back from the dead someone who has died
6276301 just because he was young he could have been a babe in arms but if he died it was his time
6276302 its not a matter of time persephone its a matter of action if you bring him back where will he go who will believe that hes alive again and if they do how will it affect them how will his parents react if their only son their only child has not only died but comes back to them speaks to them tells them that his wasnt a self inflicted death but one done by demons for that matter what will the demons do
6276303 ill just be going then with my job having been done
6276304 i hadnt thought about it but i dont care ill find a way ill bring him back and we well run away
6276305 follow me then if its your wish to drag someone from the depths of hell weve a long journey to make and little enough time to do it
6276306 perhaps because i want to see how this all turns out persephone

6276326 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6276327 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6276328 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6276329 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6276330 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6276331 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6276332 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6276333 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6276334 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6276335 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6276336 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6276337 a hole i swear im gonna slot one of these kids one day

6276354 i pulled the groin about the second week of training camp i just kept practicing and my hamstring just started getting tight up high after that i started sitting out
6276355 this is the preseason so im not really stressing right now
6276356 i just want to get those quality reps and run those hot routes with eli thats probably the most unfortunate thing
6276357 mentally it was a little difficult to deal with not being able to be out there and do the stuff i ordinarily do and seeing guys out there working and not being able to help
6276358 but in terms of me being ready for the season its not going to be difficult for me to pick up where i left off
6276359 but especially to be out when youre young i dont think thats a good combination

6276366 davin is the kind of guy that might take the boot off and play knowing him
6276367 so im not going to discount him playing in the opener or the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville theres a chance he might not be ready for a couple weeks
6276368 im not happy with it to be honest with you
6276369 im sick for davin joseph hes one of the ringleaders on this football team so im disappointed im hurt for him im also confident that we have the stuff to pick up the slack while hes getting himself ready to play obviously its a tough blow for us here at this time but its also very exciting for somebody to step up
6276370 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6276371 obviously jeremy zuttah will be a factor at that position dan buenning has experience playing guard there are the possibilities of adding a player here or there so i dont want to say too much right now at this point were confident in the guys we have
6276372 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6276373 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6276374 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6276375 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6276376 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6276377 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6276378 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6276379 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6276380 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6276381 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6276382 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6276383 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful

6276393 and the greens get a little funkier in that stretch too
6276394 and i knew if i missed the fairway i wasnt going to be able to get it to the green with my second shot
6276395 driving it in the fairway is a premium this week because the rough is pretty bad
6276396 if you hit the ball in the fairway every hole is a birdie hole

6276430 jewelry designed for men used to be a step child in the jewelry business as compared to womens jewelry
6276431 shopping why we love it and how retailers can create the ultimate customer experience
6276432 but in 2006 the mens jewelry market reached a 10 percent share of the market so it cant be ignored any longer by jewelry marketers and retailers
6276433 our findings suggest that men are putting their experience as knowledgeable consumers of womens jewelry to work in making fine jewelry purchases for themselves
6276434 now that many men are abandoning business casual for more formal business attire they are interested in accenting their wardrobes not only with a fine watch but gold rings and cufflinks and as well
6276435 jewelry shoppers in their search for higher quality merchandise and more fashion forward designs found that the service and expert advice available in jewelry stores was exactly what they needed they were willing to trade up for service and experiences that they couldnt find in discount and warehouse retailers
6276436 those arent cigarettes those are werthers what am i 90

6276440 is to build the best condominiums in the world by focusing on quality of life by building in amenities like our own coffeehouse and wine bar a 9th floor sky lounge with views of the strip and services like dog day care we can truly impact the way our residents live
6276441 its magic its wonderful the bunnies are back the legend is re born ive had a lot of adventures in my life but this truly is the cherry on top of the cake this is as good as it gets
6276442 it is a dream come true the feeling is euphoric as we recreate the classic cachet in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation
6276443 pull the 2 strategically placed gold ribbons and she becomes nude
6276444 the rabbit logo has to be the most recognizable of any in the world this is our 1 million salute 30ft high and just over 2 stories on the 24th and 25th floors so it can be seen from the strip the i 15 and up to a mile away its an electronic led so we can have any color and any image we want on it we selected video from the early days of playboy for the inside screen to make it very special and unique we have resurrected the brand for the 21st century and i believe everybody will accept it and embrace it because the tv show has helped tremendously and a whole new generationhas become fascinated with the playboy image that christy has reborn in a new direction plus we have the most gorgeous girls in the world in their new roberto cavalli uniforms complete with trademark fluffy rabbit tails and ears as our playboy dealers and cocktail servers and when i gave him the tour of his very own sky villa he stopped took a moment and said this is a very special time for me he was in tears absolutely blown away by what he saw
6276445 to recreate the classic cache of the playboy clubs in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation is a dream come true when people see these venues they will be blown away this is the coolest party in town i was the person who had the sad task of closing the very last club 20 years ago and now im the happiest person re opening a brand new one its a euphoric feeling today though we are very different from the past its very important to remember we are not a standalone nightclub here but an integrated entertainment experience with dancing in moon drinking and dining in nove and entertainment and gaming in the playboy club so people will experience the brand in 3 different kinds of ways its the next generation of what a nightclub should be no nightclubs were ever more successful than playboy clubs for the number of years they were open they had the best entertainment the coolest guests and the greatest food all those years ago today though its impossible to book entertainment in such small clubs so thats why gaming became the important element what weve all done here in vegas will now be duplicated in london macau where the brand can come back to life in the same multi dimensional way this is the perfect town with the perfect partners and a family tradition continues
6276446 it is everything we wanted we kept asking hef if he was happy with what hesaw he said it was even more than we had promised he had tears in his eyes saying he was blown away and he just kept on hugging us we wanted to deliver more than beyond his wildest imagination we wanted his validation and he said we did it this is the first time ever that gaming and lounging have been integrated we wanted luxury and exclusivity without snobbery and this just smells of money
6276447 we are very happy with the girls we found as dealers and servers to represent playboy vegas
6276448 i agree that las vegas has always been considered los angeless playground and in reality the playboy mansion has always been considered a playground for the well to do and the important people in la so i think this will be the same just a little further east
6276449 this is a very exciting and memorable weekend for all of us
6276450 jesus does not look so much at the greatness of our actions or even at their difficulty as at the love with which we do them
6276451 we should expect him milf chief al haj murad ebrahim to surrender and bring to government the two commanders who are clearly responsible for these acts nothing short of that is acceptable to government
6276452 we cannot make peace at the expense of the people who have been massacred the responsible people should answer to the law
6276453 sincerity will not be shown unless they surrender to government the two base commanders
6276454 chairman murad has already given orders number 1 is stand down and two a thorough investigation
6276455 it concluded that we have critical infrastructure in this building and it needs to be protected
6276456 we would be remiss to not take action to protect this facility so we can continue to serve the community in the manner we do
6276457 everyone is entitled to his own opinions but not to his own facts

6276519 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6276520 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6276521 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6276522 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6276523 has nothing to do with coming to the table pre corrupted
6276524 a president should be smart ultimately he is the decision maker a president needs to know what he does not know and surround himself with people who are experts in their fields to supplement his knowledge base and to educate the president
6276525 our team will be composed of the smartest most capable expert advisors
6276526 energy policy will be designed by experts not oil companies and it will not be done in secret science policy will be made by scientific experts not religious fanatics military policy will be informed by the best military minds not by life long professional bureaucrats with defense industry ties laws will be enforced by the best legal minds not by people whose sole qualification is that they agree with the president about theology
6276527 having a stick in the region which can provide measured rapid responses to conflagrations which ignite so quickly is critical had we had a stronger presence in the gulf region in the late 80s and early 90s saddam never would have invaded kuwait in the first place we need to make certain that the efforts of our troops are not thrown in the waste basket because politicians make specious arguments for false peace

6276532 our focus at the denver super rally will be to expand the debates beyond just two parties
6276533 its an issue of central concern to many americans and extends far beyond any one candidate it is a first amendment matter of speech petition and assembly during a presidential election for both the candidates and the voters
6276534 if tens of millions of americans could hear the nader gonzalez message through the presidential debates it would be a three way race
6276535 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
6276536 i met with sean penn and we talked at length
6276537 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of presidential debates he did support kucinich in the primaries and saw how dennis was excluded from msnbc debates

6276541 a key pillar of the u s strategy to pacify iraq is in danger of collapsing
6276542 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6276543 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6276544 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go bacck to zero i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6276545 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6276546 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6276547 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6276548 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6276549 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6276550 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6276551 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6276552 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6276558 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
6276559 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6276560 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6276561 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6276565 this is a matter for the aca not us the government
6276566 the aca is quite active and im happy we can see the end result of their activities
6276567 we dont politicise issues they were suspected of accepting bribes and that was why they were arrested
6276568 we had investigated and charged umno leaders in the past for graft we have also charged high ranking civil servants this case is no different
6276569 corruption is corruption they were allegedly involved and we arrested them it has nothing to do with politics
6276570 we just cannot let them go if the people in power are corrupt dont expect us as the enforcement agency to just listen and see without reacting
6276571 even if the dap parti keadilan rakyat umno or other parties for that matter have information on graft they should inform us
6276572 i wont rule out that this is part of an intimidation or plan to incriminate our elected representatives to make the state government lose its majority

6276582 to be recognized by inc is an honor as well as a statement of validation for what we set out to achieve
6276583 and to be recognized as the 18th fastest growing real estate related company during the greatest market upheaval since the great depression is further confirmation that were being embraced by the market
6276584 like making love to a kangaroo it aint easy but its gotta be done
6276585 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6276586 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6276587 these findings add to a growing literature in experimental animals and humans attributing long term consequences for offspring of maternal gestational stress
6276588 they suggest both a sex specificity and a relatively short gestational time window for gestational effects on vulnerability to schizophrenia
6276589 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6276594 this is a 44 increase in the demand on cyf services yet the identification of actual child abuse has dropped 11 this is consistent with a disturbing trend nationwide
6276595 this is perfect proof that the ideologically flawed anti smacking law has resulted in unwarranted reports of good parents which is a waste of the limited resources of cyf
6276596 cyf resources are being wasted because of a law that labels good parents as potential child abusers and distracts cyf and police from dealing with the real causes of child abuse and actual child abuse
6276597 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6276598 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6276599 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6276600 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6276601 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6276602 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannie and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages

6276633 the songs they were singing were traditional but had a fresh energy and perspective
6276634 it made me realize that i could take the songs that were important to me and give them a freshness and a vitality had it not been for my daughters exploration on the new perspective on folk music i dont think i would have considered doing the project it would have just been peter paul and mary without paul and mary now it is something special
6276635 it is symbolic of my daughter carrying on the music that i love

6276835 clinton backers are in for a shock if they think they can secretly support mccain now and expect clinton to still have a political career in 2012
6276836 those hillary supporters think that shes got any chances in 2012
6276837 as i write this let me include a caveat that i am an obama supporter all that aside
6276838 this isnt about policy its personal the clintons are still piqued at losing so contrary to everything they said they supported they are willing to throw the country to the wolves yeah makes me believe they have the countrys best interests in mind not
6276839 with obama support starting to fade from older dems recovering from the obama kool aid hangover
6276840 it does not bother me a bit the fact that hillary and her family are friends with any republican
6276841 sickens me how party supporters big name party supporters just decide to trade sides w o ramifications
6276842 stella you are rediculas and writing a such nonsense opinion
6276843 i thought i was all out of surprises when it came to the clintons
6276844 hillary needs to stop playing games and get her people on board
6276845 the clinton drama continues they just seem to have a nack of getting in the thick of it
6276846 i live in mi and i am for hillery clinton she would have won mi but that was all a big mess like fl and the wrong man was placed in office
6276847 how many of those female former hillary supporters want the supreme court to take away their right to choose
6276848 i wonder what people are thinking about not voting for obama because clinton is not nominated
6276849 remember the clintongs just need to get a chunk of superdelegates to switch to hrc and the convention gets crazy quickly im looking forward to a huge surprise next week with hrc emerging the victor in november
6276850 isnt this a cute and chummy meeting even brought the kiddies to witness the changeover to the gop
6276851 to all those who are not trolls and who claim to be clinton supporters who are going to vote for mccain
6276852 i almost hate to say this but i see no other reason for it
6276853 i see a lot of hate comments toward obama across comment boards
6276854 melissa contorno 8 32 am and all those who are not sure which way they will vote what are the reasons you will not vote for obama
6276855 maybe the rodhams are trying to do whats best for this nation and lets not forget that hillary was a goldwater girl and mccain replaced goldwater as senator and is probably his only torchbearer remaining in the senate
6276856 john paul telhomme i did serve in the mountains of afghanistan and the deserts of iraq
6276857 there are huge differences between bho and hrc hillary didnt have to steal her policies obama steals everything that isnt nailed down he stole mlks tone jfks words cesar chavez battle cry hillary and edwards policies etc etc
6276858 john paul telhomme i did serve in the mountains of afghanistan and the deserts of iraq
6276859 just because you are a democrat doesnt mean that you have to support obama
6276860 in november obamas defeat will go down as the biggest loss upset in election history for a u
6276861 this is totally a sham if hillary silently backs mccain
6276862 i cant believe the under cover slime going on these fools would rather see sen

6276906 the real difference is that we have the moral high ground russia is an autocracy aspiring to annex its neighbors with military force
6276907 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6276908 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6276909 protect the us from missile threats from the middle east
6276910 initially the missile defense shield was supposed to be constructed to
6276911 indeed russia has long been told to simply accept the facts heres the independence of kosovo for you heres the abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty and the american decision to place missile defenses in neighboring countries heres the unending expansion of nato all of these moves have been set against the backdrop of sweet talk about partnership why would anyone put up with such a charade

6277013 its more of a mental grind than it is physical
6277014 obviously your arm is going to go through some dead stages and get tired for sure
6277015 when youre out there and preparing yourself every day to compete your arm is going to get tired but its more of trying to keep yourself in it mentally more than a physical battle
6277016 its just a matter of like i said keeping yourself in it every day mentally and just trying to keep yourself prepared for those moments
6277017 its a situation where youve got one out to get
6277018 you concentrate on that hitter you know theres a lot of stuff going on behind you on the bases but right there youve just got to concentrate on getting that one guy at the plate you know if you can get him youve got a clean inning the next time so you really just focus in on that one batter at that moment
6277019 weve just got so many carries that i want to see him do during the preseason just to get his pads set and make sure his legs are ready and hes set for those full speed collisions he scrimmaged during training camp and hes been everything but tackled to the ground most of the time in training camp
6277020 we felt like we had a solid nucleus of players and what weve done is gone out and got some guys to make the group better
6277021 the thing thats really important to me is that they fit in very well weve talked a lot about being a great teammate and what exactly a great teammate is because the cohesiveness of our team is whats going to determine i think how successful we are this season
6277022 it wasnt easy for him he was grinding he wasnt as sharp as he has been his last couple starts but he made it it wasnt pretty by any means but he was effectively wild enough to keep guys off balance i was pleased more with our bullpen the way our bullpen came in and pitched
6277023 there is not much in the tank at the end of the day
6277024 i dont know that it was a death spiral but i mean it was a pretty dire situation
6277025 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished

6277030 the combined effects of south louisiana cajun catholics trending more republican because of social issues these southern white voters kept louisiana a swing state longer than most deep south states and the disproportionate exodus of democratic voting urban african americans in new orleans have made louisiana increasingly republican
6277031 national trends toward democrats are having an effect here as well
6277032 this attitude is one that has permeated the pundits the media and some critics contend even the democratic nominees campaign but it is not true
6277033 continued and largely unanswered negative campaign on the part of mccain
6277034 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed
6277035 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
6277036 is probably the safest one of the three for democrats and ellsworth has really managed to match his district
6277037 the only one thats at all an open question is the 9th
6277038 anything can happen in politics but right now its hills to lose
6277039 people want change and getting a new president is part of that
6277040 i think people have changed their tune a little since the primary
6277041 i dont see any coattails from the presidential for sodrel this time the republican brand is severely damaged in indiana and just being a republican is not going to be an asset this time around
6277042 its obvious that the republican brand is down a bit
6277043 are you still trying to maintain your integrity curse god and die
6277044 there are two equal and opposite errors into which the human race can fall about the devils one is to disbelieve in their existence the other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them they themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight
6277045 satans greatest trick is to convince a person that satan does not exist
6277046 well then what shall i do i will do both i will pray in the spirit and i will pray in words i understand i will sing in the spirit and i will sing in words i understand for if you praise god only in the spirit how can those who dont understand you praise god along with you how can they join you in giving thanks when they dont understand what you are saying you will be giving thanks very nicely no doubt but it doesnt help the other people present
6277047 it is better to be godly and have little than to be evil and possess much
6277048 the steps of the godly are directed by the lord he delights in every detail of their lives
6277049 the desires of lazy people will be their ruin for their hands refuse to work they are always greedy for more while the godly love to give
6277050 blessed be your name when im found in the desert place though i walk through the wilderness blessed be your name
6277051 you who are spiritual should restore such a one with a spirit of gentleness
6277052 what does it mean to be spiritual in the truly christian sense what would that mean
6277053 but the fruit of the spirit is love and so forth
6277054 be self controlled and alert your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour
6277055 now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them job 1 6 kjv
6277056 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away
6277057 i am a rain cloud walk before me and be wet because i am wet
6277058 have you considered my servant job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who fears god and shuns evil
6277059 spiritual growth occurs when you exercise your soul not on the basis of feelings but on the basis of gods word during the problems and concerns of this life
6277060 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked shall i return there the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord
6277061 have you considered my servant job that there is none like him on the earth a blameless and upright man one who fears god and shuns evil and still he holds fast to his integrity although you incited me against him to destroy him without cause
6277062 just holding a big stick waiting for you to mess up so he can clobber you
6277063 i will pray with the spirit and i will also pray with the understanding
6277064 those whose hearts are right shall not err for want of heavenly direction where god sanctifies the heart he enlightens the head we all wish to choose our way but what a mercy is it when the lord directs that choice and makes free will to be goodwill if we make our will gods will god will let is have our will
6277065 god does not violate our will but leaves much to our choice nevertheless he instructs our wills and so we choose that which is well pleasing in his sight
6277066 the will should be subject to law there is a way which we should choose but so ignorant are we that we need to be taught and so wilful that none but god himself can teach us effectually
6277067 the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord
6277068 shall we indeed accept good from god and shall we not accept adversity
6277069 why did i not die at birth why did i not perish when i came from the womb
6277070 why is light given to him who is in misery and life to the bitter of soul who long for death but it does not come and are glad when they can find the grave
6277071 though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholds him with his hand
6277072 i have been young and now am old yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken
6277073 if these were just water why was his blood alcohol 04 several hours later
6277074 replays the american invasion and occupation of iraq and the selling of the war on terror as a sarcastic surreal satire
6277075 and im talking about one so much that im not really watching any right now when i make one i dont usually watch one
6277076 after rape victim used cell phone to call for help kbr bans use of personal phones in iraq
6277077 one case is not enough for the health ministry to decide on an amendment on the law
6277078 categorical opinion that if the child is born it would suffer from serious handicaps
6277079 zero doesnt send a message and 128 can be excessive
6277080 it leaves us at the status quo which is a gray area
6277081 it is very clear that this is the states territory its not local governments
6277082 were not sure where the other 28 goes but none goes to us
6277083 we lose money when we write a ticket for a seat belt violation it costs us money we dont think thats equitable
6277084 and to pay an officer to defend writing a traffic ticket you also have to pay that persons mileage and pay someone else to be in their place back in the city
6277085 when i find out a locality is considering this i call them and say please dont
6277086 based on the company we keep i have a comfort level
6277087 so having the ability to appropriately enforce those rules i think will be all the more important
6277088 selbst das beste personal wird der spd nichts n tzen wenn sie sich nicht gemeinsam auf einen sozialdemokratisch roten faden verst ndigt

6277091 a fool is a terrible thing to have around but a fool with energy is a nightmare
6277092 therefore the constitutional power of a citizen led initiative does not extend to this proposal
6277093 consequently the initiative petition does not meet the constitutional prerequisites for acceptance
6277094 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
6277095 this is a case that illustrates everything that is wrong with the death penalty in texas
6277096 the governor cant grant clemency without a recommendation for it weve seen cases get stayed literally at the eleventh hour so its not over
6277097 help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6277098 small missile threats of the kind that iran or north korea might impose and not aimed in any way at russia
6277099 almost every assault of any kind is related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6277100 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6277101 we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6277102 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6277103 you cant build an offshore wind turbine in 498 days and we arent going to have thousands of roofs paneled with solar panels in 498 days
6277104 this is a long term project and the mayor felt its time we should be part of it
6277105 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6277106 the shortage of interpreters will pose a problem because its already difficult enough to get to guantanamo and to see ones client
6277107 if we got them to change the rules the number of hours and we worked new york lawyers hours instead of a european auto plant workers schedule there would be less of a problem
6277108 the financial results are essentially consistent with our expectations the residual impacts to our current performance from the issues prior to 2007 are being overcome each day as the company builds momentum from the turnaround plan the new management team put in place last year although the economic and competitive pressures remain difficult and we have been temporarily hampered by the impacts of the financial restructuring our initiatives are advancing positively including improvements in operational efficiency quality management processes customer service and sales management we continue to see progress winning back customers as well as with new customer wins
6277109 as we continue with the capital structure improvement phase of our turnaround we are comfortable with the strong foundation that has been established over the past year however we are continuing to identify opportunities for additional cost reductions and growth
6277110 sun chemicals major investments in research and development are paying off for our customers in the screen digital narrow web label brand protection and electronics materials industries

6277288 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6277289 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6277290 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6277291 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6277335 marketers will be able to pay to accelerate usage they find valuable to dial up and down actions that people take on applications as part of the social ads program for instance news feed uses an algorithm to communicate a users actions to the friends who would find it most interesting marketers will be able to pay for increased or enhanced distribution above and beyond what news feed already provides
6277336 but it doesnt look like that to your friends because they care about you
6277337 positioned at the low end of the market dish networks business has deteriorated sharply
6277338 churn has spiked higher share of gross additions has fallen customer satisfaction scores have declined subscriber growth fell by 90 percent in the first quarter and then got worse going negative in the second quarter and satellite sector headwinds are mounting with the telcos increasingly positioned as competitors rather than distributors
6277339 if you start with the basic premise that every american family is going to have broadband like water and electricity and cable is increasingly the default broadband provider then the satellite operators face the stiff challenge of coexisting in cable households
6277340 at the moment palm is just trying to keep the company going before this hopefully revolutionary new device arrives
6277341 the problem here is the pricing structure has changed the iphone went down to 200 the samsung instinct went down to 230
6277342 this is no longer the same phone market we had a year ago
6277343 what matters to them is what they can do why do people love iphone they love the apps why dont people love windows mobile its in fact an amazing operating system but the apps on top of it not so inspired
6277344 its really exciting its one of the biggest mysteries right now
6277345 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6277346 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6277347 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6277348 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6277349 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6277350 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6277351 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6277352 i cant do it i have to support internet explorer
6277353 snacking on readily digested carbohydrates such as those in a cookie or bagel can raise the brains level of the chemical serotonin the very same target of modern antidepressant medication
6277354 if nobodys told you youre doing a great job out there
6277355 wow you finally look just as miserable as the rest of us
6277356 its really common with law firms we used to have one on the sixth floor and we used to have people leave the building in tears in the middle of the day
6277357 i just dont want to send anything out with inaccurate information once it leaves your hands you cant take it back
6277358 and i know youre not supposed to be in here after 5 so lets just do it in the morning
6277359 i asked them to put me on the list as if i were available
6277360 it seems like everyone here is a paralegal except us
6277361 and were the ones who are responsible when these things go to court makes me wonder what everyone else does
6277362 maybe this is like paralegal gold or maybe its like a reality show and they have immunity so they cant be voted off we mustve lost the challenge last week

6277371 thats going to work out pretty good for us if it was happening right now at this moment wed feel a little bit behind were not quite ready
6277372 i think the one mistake thats being made here is that these are all of our characters they belong to all of us and if theres something that we all want to see you kind of have to say yes
6277373 hes doing it hes stretching up like only the elongated man could
6277374 the new rallying cry of web 3 0 is that anyone can innovate anywhere code is written collaborated on debugged tested deployed and run in the cloud when innovation is untethered from the time and capital constraints of infrastructure it can truly flourish

6277377 i think it was her fathers birthday that night when we were on that balcony and she was just sitting there talking about her dad
6277378 so what was my job not to say a lot but to listen to her talk about her dad
6277379 here are a sister and a brother in the olympic village greatest athletes in the world but theyre missing their dad
6277380 didnt do well did bad i did terrible it was devastating
6277381 and before it was over his head was on my shoulder he was crying but he had put his shades on although i knew his pain knew his burden knew his failure he still didnt want me to see him cry
6277382 ive never been in a place where they were so celebrated but under so much pressure
6277383 you were not just representing your school your family or your town you were on a worldwide stage and if they didnt have it together mentally physically and spiritually it would be very tough for them to make it
6277384 i think it was her fathers birthday that night when we were on that balcony and she was just sitting there talking about her dad
6277385 so what was my job not to say a lot but to listen to her talk about her dad
6277386 here are a sister and a brother in the olympic village greatest athletes in the world but theyre missing their dad
6277387 didnt do well did bad i did terrible it was devastating

6277389 ive never been in a place where they were so celebrated but under so much pressure
6277390 you were not just representing your school your family or your town you were on a worldwide stage and if they didnt have it together mentally physically and spiritually it would be very tough for them to make it
6277391 believe it or not some of them thats where they got close to god because they realized that this was a dream come true and they could not make it on their own
6277392 it came through a lot of prayer a lot of hard work a lot of times when they could have been injured and they were not and someone else was
6277393 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics
6277394 from our discussions with management internal management issues played a significant role in the underperformance during the period in question more importantly dws has not lost any clientele and the resultant impact produced only minimal staff turnover as such we believe the market may have overplayed the revised guidance on the downside
6277395 on aggregate it is our view that broad based it services demand is likely to hold up reasonably well into fy09 albeit moderating to a slower growth rate than that observed during 2007 08
6277396 the crux of the investment case on dws is our valuation of the dws business we view dws transparent and singular pricing model to be a sustainable competitive advantage
6277397 should he be considered yeah but he wont make it longoria probably will get it especially if they win

6277400 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
6277401 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
6277402 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6277403 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
6277404 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6277405 you could see the amount of heart and grit both teams put out there said ryan millar who led the united states with seven kill blocks
6277406 youve got to put it all out there or youre on the next flight home today was a great example of us saying were not going to die were going to keep fighting until the end
6277407 if something special does happen in the end it would be a great tribute to the bachmans what weve accomplished already i think theyre pretty happy with what were doing were playing our hearts out for them
6277408 we just had to settle down and get back into it mccutcheon said
6277409 these guys have got composure and character regardless of what the score is theyre just going to keep grinding it out that was a great volleyball match
6277410 mediocre hacks like geoff johns later referred to as an industry leech and shit peddler really ought to be thrown out of comics by any means necessary
6277411 by far my favorite details rachels decision to create and publish her own comics
6277412 one of the greatest publishers of girls comics that the world has ever seen
6277413 she received many emails from girls going through similar experiences
6277414 today i was contacted by an old acquaintance to briefly consult on a possible comics magazine thatd be released and sold online as a pdf
6277415 is this wally west you know where gorilla grodd sits wherever he wants har har
6277416 is this bruce wayne do you like bats well maybe you should be a baseball player then har har
6277417 iron fist is one of the few characters i can think of that can pull off the badass in slippers look
6277418 the choice isnt between reading classics or reading trash the choice is between reading trash or reading mostly nothing get rid of the flash and you will create not thousands of new readers of the filth but thousands of people who spend more time playing video games or watching friends reruns on tv iron fist gets it do you
6277419 i told him the next time he does that im going to get my blade out and cut him right on the field hey im a gangsta now you go gangsta on me im gonnahave to get you now
6277420 past returns tell you nothing about future returns and are not the right way to select investments
6277421 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
6277422 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
6277423 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
6277424 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6277425 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
6277426 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6277427 it is a dilemma it is a hard decision and certainly the outcome is not decided
6277428 giant wooden bookshelves outline big brains exposed brick interior while metallic air ducts and a mix of sophisticated and retro lighting fixtures hang overhead
6277429 if youre not enjoying johns on flash go read something else that does tickle your superhero funny bone
6277430 and if youre really upset that the flash as a particular character is unreadable in his monthly title search out some back issues on ebay that are more to your liking
6277431 ill grant you for the sake of argument that johns is a hack and that his mere competency is somehow the biggest threat facing comics
6277432 i still dont understand why anyone should expend any energy toward removing him from comics
6277433 dont pretend 1 that repeated ranting about johns will get others who have reflected upon his work and legitimately enjoy it for whatever reason to stop buying his work or 2 that removing johns and everyone else somehow determined to be substandard will magically elevate comics to a medium where only good works grace the shelves
6277434 i find it interesting that mark millar makes your list of approved superhero comic book writers
6277435 i havent read johns flash so im not sure how sadomasochistic it is
6277436 i have read parts of millars ultimates and ultimate x men and spider man and those all seem pretty sadistic and brutal to me
6277437 isnt millars approach on books meant to serve as entry level titles totally inappropriate given that the featured characters appear in movies and other media geared toward children
6277438 the majority of people who buy comics and support their local comics shops want nothing more than to be comforted by the type of shit geoff johns can squeeze out in his deep and dreamless sleep
6277439 who have reflected upon his work and legitimately enjoy it
6277440 if you honestly cant detect a qualitative difference between the work of grant morrison and geoff johns then theres no point whatsoever in discussing this
6277441 i hadnt pegged you as one of those people who gets nervous and defensive when someone like me states the truth passionately john and i hope im wrong because i like what you do
6277442 talking about the dichotomy allows a writer to compare and contrast which you may have heard is a valid technique in discussing two elements that share similar properties
6277443 heres a big revelation john everything i write is my opinion feel free to dismiss or embrace it as you like as long as you are able to understand it
6277444 i find it interesting that mark millar makes your list of approved superhero comic book writers
6277445 anyone looking for actual creative energy to be expended in the creation of these sooperhero funnybook entertainments
6277446 he comes around and talks to everybody but im not even sure what his job description is
6277447 mini why dont they just start putting random years from the 1990s in the copyrights too while theyre at it
6277448 ongoing ill just have to catch up around the anniversary issue 50 that it will no doubt reach and some huge
6277449 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6277450 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6277451 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6277452 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6277453 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6277454 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6277455 just to kind of get in the spirit you know
6277456 its awesome we draw a line down the middle of our room and she says margaux dont come across this line
6277457 yeah im doing a really good job in teaching her about cleanliness
6277458 she shows me look sheila i folded my clothes over here and im like good job margaux
6277459 shes remembering now to take her key out of the room too instead of always asking me for my key
6277460 margaux is actually so mature for a 16 year old its astonishing
6277461 its more like a big sister little sister relationship than a mother daughter relationship
6277462 but im surprised sometimes shell be like jammin to my tunes and ill be like wow shes awesome shes great shes very cool
6277463 the first few nights here in the village id look over and shes sound asleep while im wide awake at midnight and through the night
6277464 were like complete opposites here but we get along great which is funny
6277465 im just a bubbly person thats the way i am
6277466 sometimes i dont understand whats going on with a 39 year old and sometimes she doesnt understand whats going on with a 16 year old
6277467 but we understand how much hard work it has taken to be here and we definitely respect that in each other
6277468 she has picked me up so many times when i was just dead
6277469 and there have been times when ive called her crying
6277470 i think ive slowed down a bit where its hard for me to get motivated out that door and then shes so excited to go do a swim workout so im like well i guess i should be excited about it too shes keeping me young i think
6277471 100 percent all the proceeds go to golisano childrens hospital at strong which is a wonderful resource hopefully people never have to use it but if you do its comforting to know its there
6277472 macko a retired general motors corp worker used to buy a new car every year but hes been leasing the last few years

6277477 theres uncertainty surrounding new developments on freddie and fannie and investors dont have the right cues to buy stocks thats why we dont have a situation where energy linked shares can buoy the overall market
6277478 this entire thread makes me want to rip the pulsing hearts from the chests of half of you
6277479 wow talk about your wretched hive of scum and villainy huh
6277480 its not helpful its reactionary and makes you sound like a moron
6277481 not impossible but improbable that canfield will be no 2 at stanford penn state dts dropping like flies beavers work at reser and the rodgers brothers saga canfields shoulder turning into a major issue riley says hes not afraid to use engstrom at stanford
6277482 they actually think it might be something that calms down and he can play and if not theyll have to do a scope said coach riley

6277485 this nih award recognizes the value of this important research conducted by falanga and his colleagues
6277486 the environment for grants of this nature has grown increasingly competitive and i thank the nih for helping advance research that has the potential to better the lives of people not only in our region but around the world
6277487 this will give us the tools to uphold the law in a fair a fair and equitable manner
6277488 i realize this debate is a very difficult debate i realize this is an emotional issue but there is a public safety component to this problem
6277489 every one in law enforcement operates under a microscope all the time where people will hold you to very high standards thats why its important to have this group
6277490 if youre going to do this kind of work its important that you do it right
6277491 advocacy groups who say theyre speaking on behalf of immigrants
6277492 theres something very wrong when it becomes politically incorrect to arrest illegal immigrants who are breaking the law
6277493 were much more similar with all of the other police departments than dissimilar
6277494 were all doing the same thing we all face the same challenges were all coming up with the best way to deal with this issue and i think thats smart
6277495 today we have gone to court to seek an end to decades of inadequate and unequal funding the state of illinois has given our schools
6277496 our children especially african americans and latinos have been left behind because of poorly funded schools while their white counterparts in wealthy communities are thriving
6277497 our principle focus has been a 50 state voter registration initiative i think we all appreciate that if we increase the number of african american registered voters and then increase turnout and get people to the polls on nov 4 then sen obama will be the next president of the united states
6277498 while the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history
6277499 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water

6277502 you have to do it in a way that passes the test that passes the global test where your countrymen your people understand fully why youre doing what youre doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons
6277503 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
6277504 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6277505 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6277506 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality

6277519 i didnt realize there were that many in our school district
6277520 its not like one is dominant its all over and its sad
6277521 i think in some ways its misleading because typically in the cases we work with children know their perpetrators
6277522 its ok to say no and its ok to be loud about it
6277523 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6277524 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity
6277525 i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future we have achieved a lot over the past three years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6277526 the organisation is in better financial health than ever and i am also delighted to have seen the recent launch of the respect programme which is very important to me
6277527 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success while i also believe the plans for the national football centre will benefit english football in the long term
6277528 i dont disagree with anything youve said and thank you and im grateful for your support of all of our veterans
6277529 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6277530 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6277531 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6277532 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6277533 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6277534 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6277535 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6277536 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6277537 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6277538 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6277539 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6277540 seems like a pretty major omission for a service thats specifically aimed at roaming users
6277541 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6277542 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6277543 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6277544 well i dont know if it was me doing it it would be just to create some fun and joy in peoples lives i assume thats what theyre trying to do
6277545 got a present this morning tissues on the front door
6277546 last week we had been to a funeral and she had run out of tissues so my husband gave her our pack of tissues and she said oh ill get them back to you and we said you can keep the tissues
6277547 the fact that it was on the side of my house really bothered me because someone walking up on my property at such a late hour
6277548 obviously this is just aiming at saving the lives of the people and improving their nutritional status but it will not empower the people to improve their resilience to future shocks in that regard we are trying to implement early recovery activities like distribution of seeds and other agro related activities to improve their production capacity
6277549 people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves
6277550 flooding destroyed one of the harvests and the drought didnt allow the farmers to cultivate following two harvest periods
6277551 there are two clear reasons the regional one that is affecting not only the region but pretty much the entire world is the issue of increasing the oil prices which have had an enormous impact in the production of food second in general ethiopia is only able to produce about 60 percent of the food needs despite of the fact that 80 percent of the population is actually engaged in food production activities
6277552 one of the latest reports from one of the organizations involved in nutrition in the area shows that the global acute malnutrition rate stands around 17 to 19 percent which is an enormous figure for that area with a severe acute malnutrition rate of around 3 1 percent which is something extraordinary once more extraordinarily high
6277553 this is how it is done this is how it has always been done this is how ive always done it
6277554 we have already built and opened the new albany primary school boosted computer facilities at local primary schools and provided more than 7m for improvements at the great southern tafe
6277555 albany can now offer school leavers the option of university studies without their needing to move to perth and thats a great thing
6277556 todays announcement enables those options to be expanded further still as well as boosting the citys presence and reputation in research
6277557 he comes out and says he wants infrastructure into regional areas and the two biggest areas albany and geraldton are getting all the money for infrastructure and hes not giving us his preference
6277558 theyve just gone back to the safety of the liberal party and not shown any courage at all
6277559 we have worked really hard to get money into our regions and theyre not giving us their vote
6277560 they went for the libs because they havent got the courage to stand on their own
6277561 theyll take our preferences to get grant woodhams moore and terry redman over the line because without preferences both of them cant get in
6277562 we believe this is the most effective means for the nationals to get the most out of the upcoming election and get the best deal for regional western australia and the albany region
6277563 the albany electorate wants a local member who puts their interests first and doesnt just put the interests of their party first
6277564 i think by doing block preferences doesnt necessarily service the best interests of the electorate
6277565 i think that the change is coming in the form of the national party implementing our policy of royalties for region and holding the balance of power
6277566 a new hospital on a new site is my priority
6277567 we think this is the only way that albany can get the services that are required for the future
6277568 also making sure albany has long term solutions in regard to water
6277569 water is too important to be faced by short sightedness
6277570 i expect to win i enter every contest with the utmost confidence i intend to get 50 per cent of the primary vote
6277571 the albany electorate realise the nationals the only effective means to secure the best possible outcome for their future which is only through the nationals holding the balance of power
6277572 it was important that we waited until that moment before any decisions were made because pre emptive decisions would not have been what the nationals thought albany wanted and would not have serviced the albany electorate
6277573 cs1936 could not find an implementation of the query pattern for source type x
6277574 it is obvious the deliberate depravation and systemic racism of planned parent hood continues to reach new levels of disgust stated rev clenard h childress jr the president of learn northeast and founder of black genocide org
6277575 this website is engineered to reach the youth of america and undoubtedly will be featured in their health curriculum that is in many of our public school systems
6277576 due to the recent undercover work of lisa rose we now have recorded evidence of planned parenthoods blatant racist practices against afro americans and its past time they are held accountable this cant go on
6277577 oh no i think this may not have been such a good idea

6277583 gostaria de enfatizar que na china atividades de apoio independ ncia do tibete ser o fortemente condenadas pelo povo chin s e n o ser o bem vindas
6277584 anyhow if you want a target to shoot for it makes more sense to target instapundit than bass pundit
6277585 mas tamb m sem esquecer a ajuda que os grandes produtores podem dar
6277586 se nem come amos ainda a dar dimens o industrial ao programa do biodiesel atrav s da mamona porque tem muita pesquisa para melhorar a qualidade da semente para saber o que se faz com a glicerina e que tipo de a o vamos conduzir
6277587 tem todo um processo a ser discutido mas aqueles que n o acreditam no programa j come am a vender que n o vai dar certo
6277588 essa a grande oportunidade que temos de desenvolver uma parte do pa s que h 300 anos conhecida como a parte mais miser vel
6277589 temos que impedir que ele caia no desvio como outros programas bem intencionados ca ram no brasil e a preciso olhar o desenvolvimento do programa com lupa principalmente porque a discuss o do biodiesel tem causado celeuma e grandes debates daqueles que dizem que a produ o de biodiesel vai substituir a quest o do alimento
6277590 se algu m deixar de plantar alimentos e dedicar toda sua terra para plantar coisas para o biodiesel estar cometendo um erro
6277591 um ser humano normal deixe de produzir combust vel para seu est mago para suprir a necessidade energ tica e org nica de que precisa
6277592 que totalmente compat vel termos uma grande pol tica de biocombust vel com uma grande pol tica de produ o de alimentos
6277593 est na hora da gente apostar num grande investimento de financiamento de tecnologias e ao mesmo tempo levar assist ncia t cnica para todos aqueles que j t m a sua terra tornarem na a mais produtiva poss vel
6277594 i do feel we are actually getting there although there is currently a hiatus with the waterfront still not developed and the esplanade hotel not rebuilt
6277595 weve been told that the esplanade earthworks will start later this year and will be finished by late 2010
6277596 they the developers have given us a guarantee they will do that they are just trying to fine tune the development
6277597 there is a lot of competition for city funding so i would really like to encourage operators to think about ways they could contribute to what we are doing
6277598 we could then draw on that bank and use prizes for our promotions
6277599 feedback from the industry has told us that operators need someone to speak to from the industry on a one to one basis which is why weve employed megan
6277600 im really looking forward to working with local tourism operators
6277601 this region has some of the most spectacular environment and coastline ive seen
6277602 weve lost around 30 caravan parks in wa over the past 10 years
6277603 mr pash who passed away in 1990 was a gifted and prolific illustrator
6277604 his works feature in many publications including the three volume western australias tempestuous history and pashs west commissioned by the perth building society as a contribution to the states 150th anniversary
6277605 i think there is a lot of cynicism involved with the way the hospital pledge that has come from the government obviously matched by the opposition
6277606 i think rather than pledges people want to know when these projects are going to occur
6277607 our whole policy platform has been how do we create a fund that actually ensures this fund is available and is actually going to be committed
6277608 thats what our royalty for regions plan is all about
6277609 no point promising things if you dont have a way of funding it
6277610 here we are four years later albany foreshore albany hospital
6277611 in the meantime we have multiple 2 billion surpluses at the end of the day its a 2 billion surplus and country communities arent getting their basic infrastructure built
6277612 the government is paying cash for perth projects what about paying cash for the albany hospital put it aside like youve done for the mandurah railway
6277613 you can send a clear message in albany that we want building not promises by sending them a message at the ballot box
6277614 sam harma is our candidate who deserves to do well based on the fact hes not talking about cheap election promises
6277615 is anyone surprised by todd bentleys fling with a female assistant
6277616 people have been asking when hes going to come back thats hard to say
6277617 wed rather not forecast because its a difficult time for him
6277618 bentley wishes he could go to africa because its his favourite continent to go to
6277619 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6277620 the day off would probably do me good right now but im still going to have a crack at it hopefully the adrenalin will kick in tomorrow and i wont be able to feel it

6277623 the parliament just received from the government the draft of the asean charter the parliament is right now in the process of studying the charter carefully
6277624 that the charter is indeed implementable not just only a concept on paper
6277625 fraught with promises without any reference as to how those promises are going to be delivered in reality
6277626 were a very open society discussing the pros and cons its normal
6277627 i am placing the blue block on top of the red block now i am putting the green block next to the red block
6277628 i wish i could just give her the medal right now
6277629 i do feel we are actually getting there although there is currently a hiatus with the waterfront still not developed and the esplanade hotel not rebuilt
6277630 weve been told that the esplanade earthworks will start later this year and will be finished by late 2010

6277639 new research challenges a growing trend toward holding kids out of kindergarten until theyre older arguing that academic advantages are short lived and come at the expense of delaying entry into the workforce and other costs the findings show older kindergartners fare better academically largely because they learn more before starting school not because age improves aptitude said darren lubotsky a university of illinois economics professor who co wrote the study
6277640 students who send and receive instant messages while completing a reading assignment take longer to get through their texts but apparently still manage to understand what theyre reading according to one of the first studies to explore how the practice affects academic learning students who are managing busy lives may think they are accomplishing more by multitasking but they will actually need more time to achieve the same level of performance on an academic task said laura l bowman a psychology professor at central connecticut state university in new britain

6277642 harder times and higher fuel prices are following kids back to school this fall children will walk farther to the bus stop pay more for lunch study from old textbooks even wear last years clothes field trips forget about it this year it could cost nearly twice as much to fuel the yellow buses that rumble to school each morning if you think its expensive to fill up a sport utility vehicle try topping off a tank that is two or even three times as big at the same time bills are mounting for air conditioning and heating for cafeteria food and for classroom supplies all because of the shaky economy and parents have their own tanks to fill the extra costs present a tricky math problem where can schools subtract to keep costs under control
6277643 t he time may have come to reconsider how large a role technology can play in changing education there are promising examples both in the united states and abroad in the classroom the emphasis can shift to project based learning a real break with the textbook and lecture model of education in a high school class a project might begin with a hypothetical letter from the white house that says oil prices are spiking the economy is faltering and the presidents poll numbers are falling the assignment would be to devise a new energy policy in two weeks the shared web space for the project for example would include the white house letter the sources the students must consult their work plan and timetable assignments for each student the assessment criteria for their grades and eventually the paper the team delivers oral presentations would be required
6277644 we feel that we have the clearly identified clientele even though were not a specific religion and we cant be labelled a montessori or steiner
6277645 for us there is no other appropriate education option for the members of our school for secondary schooling except for home schooling which of course cant be our first choice or preference due to these parents identifying with children learning through group interaction
6277646 we are a group of committed philosophically aligned parents wanting our children to have personal education and for the families to be personally involved in the village environment we are working in there is nothing else like that in the south west
6277647 the year is ending and this needs to be resolved
6277648 we own our own land we own our current buildings and we own all of our resources
6277649 from a financial point of view were not a drain on the state
6277650 with growing and expanding our intention is still to deliver personal education
6277651 since the previous article in the donnybrook bridgetown mail every parent has written to the ministers office outlining our desire for our children to continue their education at childside

6277654 but theres conflicting reports on it right now wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is us equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it

6277671 dismissed flatly the sixth point in the plan about future international talks on south ossetias status
6277672 i rejected the document despite the fact that i was blackmailed they said if i wanted to remain in power i needed to sign the document till the end till the last drop of my blood i will be sticking to the territorial integrity and i will never give my consent for this variant
6277673 americans are now acting indirectly through georgia they have no true allies left except for several countries of east europe which they support financially
6277674 nato adopts a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia it is obvious that the georgian administration purchases weapons to continue its attempts to solve the problem of georgias territorial integrity
6277675 the russia nato council was not established to teach russia on how to behave towards georgia but to ensure security in europe and in the euro atlantic region we still believe that these goals are actual

6277681 is there any reason why i feel sick all the time
6277682 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
6277683 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom
6277684 well i reckon i could knee him in the chest to make him let go
6277685 your antics are going to get us kicked off the wagon train simon
6277686 he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul
6277687 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
6277688 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
6277689 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
6277690 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
6277691 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
6277692 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
6277693 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
6277694 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
6277695 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
6277696 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
6277697 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
6277698 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
6277699 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
6277700 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
6277701 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
6277702 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
6277703 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
6277704 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
6277705 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
6277706 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
6277707 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
6277708 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir
6277709 i know a lady who runs a boardinghouse and is in need of some help
6277710 if youre an honest sort and not afraid of solid work you might do

6277712 youre one of them what purges babes when one of us gets unlucky
6277713 like him that came last night he took the baby right but m sister hasnt stopped bleeding since
6277714 be on yore way sir m sister dont need any more help from no doctors she didnt want the first one to come but he didnt give er no choice
6277715 the quack who did that to her was no doctor
6277716 he said hed take care of us but he turned nancy out within a week after last night he said id have to take her place
6277717 zero doesnt send a message and 128 can be excessive
6277718 it leaves us at the status quo which is a gray area
6277719 it is very clear that this is the states territory its not local governments
6277720 were not sure where the other 28 goes but none goes to us
6277721 we lose money when we write a ticket for a seat belt violation it costs us money we dont think thats equitable
6277722 and to pay an officer to defend writing a traffic ticket you also have to pay that persons mileage and pay someone else to be in their place back in the city
6277723 when i find out a locality is considering this i call them and say please dont
6277724 based on the company we keep i have a comfort level
6277725 so having the ability to appropriately enforce those rules i think will be all the more important
6277726 you do not think he is funny then dont watch him
6277727 if you dont like it just dont read watch listen to it
6277728 reviews and commentary are specifically written to influence others to either watch or dont watch an entertainer
6277729 so which is it do you love the show or do you hate it so much that youve taken upon yourself a crusade to dissuade readers from watching it
6277730 i have a theory you are a racist and love the opportunity to laugh at jokes made towards people you feel are lesser than yourself but youre torn with the feeling that carlos isnt of high enough caliber racial stock to have such a priviledge
6277731 hey im just using your horrible condition to enforce my lousy comedy by creating a buzz point that appeals to the lowest common denominator
6277732 to each his own as long as your own doesnt upset me
6277733 gee they were not that good because i didnt like the way he screamed or told racist jokes or made fun of the handicap or used someone elses jokes yada yada
6277734 at this stage were waiting for formal identification procedures to take place before we take the matter any further
6277735 it may have been snagged it may have been under water for a period of time and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface
6277736 its not very nice when youve got kids of your own
6277737 man this isnt the way i wanted to go home with a medal
6277738 i would love to have crossed the line in the third place position because i looked at the replay and i dont feel like it gave spearmon an advantage i feel like he was deserving of the third place position
6277739 i was tall when i was little says bolt in trelawny parish on the north shore of jamaica an hours drive from the vacation resorts of montego bay and ocho rios he loved to play cricket with his friends and if he was talented he was also a little lazy
6277740 good tv poor sportsmanship said nbc analyst and four time olympian
6277741 he realizes that these kind of opportunities dont come along very often
6277742 i told myself im going to leave everything on the track i did just that
6277743 get in his head collins said even before bolt won the 100 meters long time los angeles based track agent
6277744 sprinters are too nice now they need to get in bolts face and intimidate him
6277745 all these other guys have these serious faces says simms
6277746 usain is just laughing and chilling im telling you the guy is just different
6277747 thats the big difference between this race and michael johnsons race said former british olympic sprinter
6277748 michael was under pressure from ato and frankie usain was all alone
6277749 i hear he looked impressive but i didnt really get to see hes 6 foot 5 and he runs like hes 5 9 he ran 9 6 in the 100 celebrating at 70 meters and hes been a 200 400 runner in the past when he got in the 200 meters here you knew he was going to run something very fast
6277750 i was saying i look cool that guy looks fast
6277751 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6277752 before the georgia invasion i was against the installation of the missile shield in poland but now after the events there i feel threatened from the east and i dont regret the decision
6277753 parchments and treaties are all very well but we have a history in poland of fighting alone and being left to our own devices by our allies
6277754 then we were stabbed in the back by the soviet union and that determined our fate for 50 years
6277755 were determined this time around to have alliances backed by realities backed by capabilities
6277756 help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6277757 small missile threats of the kind that iran or north korea might impose and not aimed in any way at russia

6277766 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6277767 we are happy we were able to delay the process even if it was only for a day
6277768 now seacliff properties know that they just cant just come down here and do what they want because this is a low income neighborhood and the perception is that nobody cares over here
6277769 while we are in a poor neighborhood which may be considered a ghetto we recognize the value and significance of these cultural structures
6277770 so we are now moving ahead and looking forward to obtaining the interim control ordinance and ultimately the overlay zone to protect the remaining houses
6277771 he is the malcolm x and the martin luther king jr of our time
6277772 hes still here with us hes part of everything that were doing hes apart of the mission of doing right his leadership still stands its still strong its still with us
6277773 it didnt matter who you were how high you were how low you were bo taylor made everybody feel like they were important and he made everybody feel good
6277774 his greatest accomplishment was taking bloods and crips and latino gangs bringing them all together and having them be at peace with one another and having unity and i guess thats why he named his organization unity one
6277775 he had universal appeal he could go into a neighborhood with crips bloods mexican mafia and nothing would happen you had no choice but to respect him
6277776 bos the type of person who can bring people together just to hear him talk
6277777 hes a genuine person and hes a realist he never bragged about the things that he did or the people he knew hes a person who moved in silence
6277778 to me thats my most memorable moment of him is doing something that the mayor the police that everyone else was always trying to do but it took someone as intelligent and as blessed by god to come up with a program and actually put it into action and it actually worked
6277779 said i can help you i can give you the answers
6277780 its a journey that had never been done before bo taylor and unity one it takes someone like bo taylor to lead the way
6277781 i enjoyed listening to him on the radio because he took no prisoners he gave no excuses he didnt let people rationalize wrong and he also used which is probably the toughest thing you can do he used his own life as an example of telling people what not to do he clearly used examples of where he went wrong to show people how their lives could be better

6277789 no i dont think its riskier heres the thing working in a prosecutors office i got to see a lot of ugliness up close and personal and some of it was between boyfriend girlfriend or spouses id be willing to bet that the bulk of those people didnt meet online there are risks online and in real life being in a relationship requires that you take a risk i dont think one risk is greater than another

6277985 why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith
6277986 this dark and wayward book is affectionately dedicated to my enemies to the curious ones who take fanatic pride in disliking me to the baffling ones who remain enthusiastically ignorant of my existence to the moral ones upon whom beauty exercises a lascivious and corrupting influence to the moral ones who have relentlessly chased god out of their bedrooms to the moral ones who cringe before nature who flatten themselves upon prayer rugs who shut their eyes stuff their ears bind gag and truss themselves and offer their mutilations to the idiot god they have invented the devil take them i grow bored with laughing at them to the anointed ones who identify their paranoic symptoms as virtues who build altars upon complexes to the prim ones who fornicate apologetically the devil can cans in their souls to the reformers once again the psychopathic ones trying forever to drown their own obscene desires in ear splitting prayers for their fellowmans welfare to the reformers the freudian dervishes who masturbate with purity leagues who achieve involved orgasms denouncing the depravities of others to the reformers patience patience the psychopathic ones who seek to vindicate their own sexual impotencies by padlocking the national vagina
6277987 i noticed you were reading something what were you reading
6277988 god help me to always be sensitive to your holy spirit so you can use me whenever youre ready
6277989 i didnt know it would be so hard i dont know if i can make it through
6277990 i dont have information yet on this issue but i will check for you
6277991 do what you can and dont worry about what you cant
6277992 remember what happened the last time you got your hopes up before and it didnt work out gods not going to come through this whole thing is going to fall apart
6277993 dont let the devil rent space in your head hes a terrible tenant
6277994 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
6277995 finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy meditate on these things
6277996 i cannot walk with these for i have not tested them
6277997 for while bodily training is of some value godliness is of value in every way as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come
6277998 therefore submit to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
6277999 weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning

6278006 maaf tuan gubernur tolong jelaskan perkara pelik ini berasal dari apakah tulang itu apa keistimewaan tulang itu sampai sampai tuan berani memutuskan untuk membongkar begitu saja bangunan yang amat mahal ini sungguh saya tidak mengerti
6278007 wahai kakek tulang itu hanyalah tulang biasa baunya pun busuk
6278008 karena berisi perintah khalifah tulang itu menjadi sangat berarti ketahuilah tulang nan busuk itu adalah peringatan bahwa berapa pun tingginya kekuasaan seseorang ia akan menjadi tulang yang busuk sedangkah huruf alif yang digores itu artinya kita harus adil baik ke atas maupun ke bawah lurus seperti huruf alif dan bila saya tidak mampu menegakkan keadilan khalifah tidak segan segan memenggal kepala saya
6278009 sungguh agung ajaran agama tuan sungguh saya rela menyerahkan tanah dan gubuk itu dan bimbinglah saya dalam memahami ajaran islam

6278019 hadits yang pertama anda katakan begini padahal yang benar adalah begini lalu hadits anda yang kedua anda katakan begini padahal yang benar seperti ini
6278020 yang hebat bukanlah kemampuan al bukhari dalam mengembalikan kedudukan hadits hadits yang salah sebab beliau memang hafal tetapi yang hebat justru hafalnya beliau terhadap kesalahan yang dilakukan oleh para penguji tersebut secara berurutan satu persatu hanya dengan sekali mendengar
6278021 ismail bin ibrahim ayahnya al bukhari mengambil riwayat hadits dari hammad bin zaid dan malik dan riwayat ismail diambil oleh ulama ulama irak
6278022 aku tidak mengenal dari hartaku barang satu dirham pun yang haram dan tidak pula satu dirham pun yang sybhat
6278023 kemudian aku berangkat haji bersama ibuku dan saudaraku setelah menginjak usia delapan belas tahun aku telah menyusun kitab tentang sahabat dan tabiin kemudian menyusun kitab tarikh di madinah di samping kuburan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ketika malam terang bulan
6278024 dan setiap kali ada nama dalam at tarikh tersebut pasti aku mempunyai kisah tersendiri tentangnya tetapi aku tidak menyukai jika kitabku terlalu panjang
6278025 aku tidak pernah menulis melainkan dari orang orang yang mengatakan bahwa al iman adalah ucapan dan tindakan
6278026 aku mendengar al bukhari berkata bahwa aku hafal seratus ribu hadits shahih dan dua ratus ribu hadits tidak shahih
6278027 seandainya aku mampu menambahkan umur muhammad bin ismail al bukhari dengan umurku niscaya aku lakukan sebab kematianku hanyalah kematian seorang sedangkan kematiannya berarti lenyapnya ilmu
6278028 dia yakni al bukhari merupakan satu ayat di antara ayat ayat allah yang berjalan di atas permukaan bumi
6278029 dia adalah imam ahlul hadits tidak ada seorang pun di antara ahlul naql yang mengingkarinya
6278030 para ulama telah bersepakat menerimanya yakni shahihul bukhari dan menerima keshahihan apa apa yang ada di dalamnya demikian pula seluruh ahlul islam
6278031 amir khalid bin ahmad adz dzuhail amir penguasa bukhara mengirim utusan kepada muhammad bin ismail yang isinya
6278032 katakanlah kepadanya bahwa sesungguhnya aku tidak akan merendahkan ilmu dan aku tidak akan membawa ilmuku itu ke hadapan pintu para sultan apabila dia butuh jika ilmu itu dikehendaki maka hendaknya dia datang kepadaku di masjidku atau di rumahku kalau hal ini tidak menyenangkan wahai sultan maka laranglah aku untuk mengadakan majlis ilmu supaya pada hari kiamat aku punya alasan di hadapan allah bahwa aku tidak menyembunyikan ilmu
6278033 perginya abu abdillah al bukhari dari negeri bukhara disebabkan khalid bin ahmad khalifah bin thahir meminta beliau untuk hadir di rumahnya supaya membacakan kitab at tarikh dan shahih kepada anak anaknya tapi beliau menolak
6278034 aku tidak mempunyai waktu jika hanya orang orang khusus yang mendengarkannya mendengarkan ilmuku pen

6278036 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un nobodys going to walk out of the un theres a lot of emotional attachment to it in the united states how do you kill it you create a parallel institution

6278044 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6278045 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6278046 these findings add to a growing literature in experimental animals and humans attributing long term consequences for offspring of maternal gestational stress
6278047 they suggest both a sex specificity and a relatively short gestational time window for gestational effects on vulnerability to schizophrenia
6278048 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6278049 we cant keep on going in the same direction weve been going in
6278050 john mccains economic plan favors one thing the creation of millions of new american jobs
6278051 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
6278052 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is

6278063 one of the most suicidal thing you can do is to keep adding to a losing position
6278064 after a devastating loss i always play very small and try to get black ink black ink its not how much money i make but just getting my rhythm and confidence back
6278065 i try not to go against the moving averages its self destructive
6278066 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6278067 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year
6278068 its fun to win anywhere but to be able to do it in all three series at various
6278069 i saved it three times before it looped i ran out of talent in the end
6278070 often speaks of the coming war between man and the brotherhood of machines
6278071 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points said the finn
6278072 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6278073 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6278074 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6278075 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6278076 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions said hamilton
6278077 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6278078 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6278079 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6278080 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit said raikkonen
6278081 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6278082 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6278083 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6278084 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me he said
6278085 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6278086 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6278087 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6278088 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
6278089 we never said we were going to donate money for the campaign
6278090 we paid for the hall and the entertainers and the surplus we said would be spent on advertisements aimed at persuading nigerians to tell their relatives in america to register to vote
6278091 there is not one nigerian who doesnt have a relative or friend in america our aim was to encourage those people to tell their family who have the right to vote in america to vote for obama
6278092 this year a newspaper put on a concert where tables cost 10m naira 87 000 43 500 and no one blinked an eye then why should they now
6278093 we want to make it clear that the event and this organisation are in no way associated with obama for america of the democratic national committee should this organisation seek to place additional advertisement in your paper
6278094 there comes a point in some interviews when you wonder whether you just asked the wrong question and everythings going to go downhill and when comingsoon
6278095 the real life football drama reunites durst with once rapper ice cube who limp bizkit toured with in 1998 during the intentionally ironically titled family values tour
6278096 fortunately things quickly recovered after our jokes bombed but its obvious that durst once the scourge of the rock world with his controversial lyrics and antics is very serious about his career as a filmmaker and that he isnt too appreciative about people i e journalists making jokes or presumptions about his intentions considering his notorious past maybe after people see this or his first movie the education of charlie banks which won an award at last years tribeca film festival theyll finally be able to separate fred durst filmmaker from fred durst of limp bizkit

6278099 proposals that would rezone this land such as the initiative on the november ballot that is being pushed by out of town developers are detrimental to our regions economy and a poor way to make major land use decisions
6278100 the summons dies with the dissolution of parliament for an election
6278101 thats the only thing that can stop us because we are bound and determined to drag all these senior conservatives before the committee and its going to be embarrassing
6278102 it certainly contradicts the spirit of the fixed election date laws to manipulate the election date to avoid embarrassment maybe they figured better to take one or two days of bad headlines than risk genuinely damaging testimony and if theyre going to pack up parliament anyway then theyre scot free
6278103 weve been winning like that all year long without certain guys in the lineup
6278104 the team is not built for one person to make it win its a team effort

6278122 hes so good because hes 6 5 and he runs like hes 5 9
6278123 hes a phenom said american walter dix who took the bronze
6278124 the guy is bad he came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6278125 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he reaches his proverbial prime
6278126 hes a baby as he gets stronger it will get scary we will all want to say we saw the evolution
6278127 hes doing things that no man of his stature could do and its a beautiful thing and hes beautiful to watch the stride it is poetry in motion
6278128 hes blessed with a unique anatomy a huge competitive heart and hes having a good time
6278129 anything is possible if i put my mind to it
6278130 im looking forward to my birthday actually im 22 now

6278132 it was the third movie that we owed united artists brian had set it up and we had nothing to do with it but i liked the movie the artwork they wanted another song so i knocked off hey bulldog its a good sounding record that means nothing
6278133 i remember it as being one of johns songs and i helped him finish it off in the studio but its mainly his vibe theres a little rap at the end between john and i we went into a crazy little thing at the end we always tried to make every song different because we figured why write something like the last one weve done that we were on a ladder so there was never any sense of stepping down a rung or even staying on the same rung it was better to move one rung ahead
6278134 bismillahir rahmanir rahim pada hari ini 15 ogos 2008 saya mohd saiful bukhari azlan nombor kad pengenalan
6278135 auzubillahi minas syaitanir rajim bismillahir rahmanir rahim wallahi wabillahi watallahi saya bersumpah bahawa saya telah diliwat oleh datuk seri anwar ibrahim pada 26 jun 2008 iaitu pada tarikh tersebut datuk seri anwar ibrahim telah memasukkan zakarnya ke dalam lubang dubur saya
6278136 jika saya berdusta atas pengakuan ini maka saya berdusta terhadap allah swt dan saya sanggup menerima azab dilaknat dan kutukan daripada allah swt sehingga kiamat wallahualam
6278137 saya amat memahami akibat bersumpah dengan nama allah jika ia tidak benar atau satu ciptaan saya atau mana mana pihak maka saya akan dilaknat ditimpa mala petaka serta bencana kepada diri saya keluarga serta keturunan saya selama lamanya
6278138 secara kebetulan saja kalau nak ikutkan saya pun tak tahu anwar akan bertanding saya buat laporan pada 28 jun lalu saya pun tak tahu bila dia akan bertanding
6278139 selama ini saya mencari kekuatan mental dan rohani allah telah beri kekuatan kepada saya pada hari ini iaitu jumaat hari yang sangat dirahmati allah
6278140 it was a stupid move by him mohd saiful and what made it worse was that it involved those who use the name of islam
6278141 swearing on the quran is not in keeping with the demands of islamic law what we have in islam is lian swearing involving married couples swearing on the holy book is a practice of christians who swear on the bible
6278142 for muslims it is lian which is the case of a man accusing his wife of having illicit sex but anwar and mohd saiful are not husband and wife
6278143 why did he do it swear on the eve of the permatang pauh by election nominations it is clear that a dirty political game is being played
6278144 i believe in anwars innocence and i am confident more will vote for him after seeing all this happening
6278145 this swearing on the quran is not a laughing matter i think it is time for him anwar to respond perhaps in the same way
6278146 he must do it if he wants to clear his name
6278147 saya yakin mohd saiful telah menjalani proses mengangkat sumpah secara tertib mengikut apa yang disyariatkan dalam islam
6278148 ini termasuklah diadakan di dalam masjid pada hari jumaat dalam keadaan suci berwuduk berkiblatkan kaabah serta mengucapkan lafaz wallahi wabillahi dan watallahi
6278149 kerana itu saya mencabar mereka yang mengkritik mohd saiful untuk tampil menunjukkan cara yang betul bagi membuktikan kaedah yang digunakan oleh anak saya adalah salah katanya
6278150 saya minta mereka berhenti mempersoalkan perkara remeh sedemikian kerana anak saya telah mengangkat sumpah dengan cara yang betul di sisi islam bukan dengan pegangan agama lain
6278151 yang penting keikhlasan dan keberanian beliau untuk menjalani proses itu tanpa keraguan jadi hentikanlah mengkritik ujarnya
6278152 jika saya berdusta saya sanggup menerima azab dilaknat dan kutukan daripada allah sehingga kiamat
6278153 jika anwar juga bersumpah laknat seperti itu mohd saiful maka jadilah mubahalah dan kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti
6278154 in islam anyone can swear that they are telling the truth but they do not have to hold the quran
6278155 its just a gimmick i dont think it is right for saiful to do especially so now that the case is in court one cannot do something that could influence the outcome of a case this is certainly on the verge of contempt
6278156 no matter how many times he swears if the doctor checks and says there is nothing wrong his oath cannot be used do not play around with the name of allah do not degrade our religion
6278157 saya jumpa pegawai jawi ada hal sikit saya akan maklumkan jika ada perkembangan

6278176 when the itunes server crashes with just thousands logging into it in the us the internet connection in india will add to apples worries when they launch it here
6278177 im sitting here and im drinking from a carton of milk right now
6278178 and the elitexc lightweight champion kj noons face is on the back of this milk carton because hes missing in action i cant seem to find him
6278179 when noons camp wants to track us down and tell us how nick diaz isnt the right fight for them or they want more money or they want this out of their contract or this and that theyre easy to get a hold of
6278180 we like to think that kj noons is a true champion a true mixed martial artist he realizes the opportunity that hes been given that other mma fighters havent been given the opportunity to be showcased on national television the opportunities for championships the money hes already making we expect him to honor the contract he signed and to fight nick diaz the no 1 contender the only contender right now the leading contender for kj noons

6278231 we were just trying to meet the needs of nonprofits
6278232 computer technology and the internet are lowering the cost of doing business

6278234 graying could be a result of chronic free radical damage
6278235 it is possible that these free radicals could influence melanin production or induce bleaching of melanin
6278236 there is evidence that local expression of stress hormones mediate the signals instructing melanocytes to deliver melanin to keratinocytes
6278237 conceivably if that signal is disrupted melanin will not deliver pigment to your hair
6278238 weve seen that people who are stressed two to three years report that they turn gray sooner
6278239 by proceeding with a traditional census in 2011 the government risks drawing national and local data needs and systems further apart
6278240 the census has been around for 200 years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services
6278241 we are left in a situation where not only does central government not know where it should distribute public money but local councils do not have the information or flexibility to work out where best to spend money to tackle worklessness and crime or to gauge where future demand will be for care homes and schools
6278242 the increasingly intrusive questions that the government is planning for the next census
6278243 many councils have been short changed in government funding because the last census failed to record properly the real number of local residents
6278244 high levels of inward migration have compounded the problems with labour ministers having little clue on the real sizes of populations in many parts of the country
6278245 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6278246 with all the work thats been done on spider feet its amazing to find something like this somehow it has been missed before
6278247 it is thought that abdominal spinnerets could be vestigial legs
6278248 there is an urgent need to assess the environmental legacy of the recent conflict and put in place a comprehensive clean up of polluted and health hazardous sites
6278249 work is on going to deal with the oil spill on the lebanese coast but we must now look at the wider impacts as they relate to issues such as underground and surface water supplies coastal contamination and the health and fertility of the land
6278250 je respecte son parcours militaire mais pas sa politique ni son parcours en politique
6278251 ils vont dire il est jeune il a un nom curieux ce nest pas un patriote
6278252 hes brought a lot to this football club and in time you guys will get to speak to the younger players about mark johnson and his time here and theyll be full of praise harvey said
6278253 not for one moment do i regret picking him up
6278254 young cale morton i might take him out for a milkshake harvey said with a smile
6278255 i understand clubs and how they have to entertain players woo them and look at trying to re establish their own list its how its done harvey said
6278256 im not going to get into chris because ive got a good relationship with chris and hes trying his damndest to get that footy club up and running and he appears to be doing a terrific job in many areas
6278257 i think what we do have to be careful of is we dont want to go down the track of other codes and you should be able to read into what i say about that
6278258 its not so much about the content of todays announcement but rather the process here we have another example of the government rolling out a new program without first consulting the people who will be affected the most
6278259 first nations including the nan communities should have been consulted holding a meeting one hour before the announcement as they did in this case is just not going to cut it
6278260 first nation people continue to be over represented as victims of crime as well as in the correctional system in relation to the rest of the population something definitely needs to be done but it needs to be done properly and with consultation with first nations we need to look at the system itself and address what changes need to be made
6278261 we are working with our partners to offer programs that will reduce the number of aboriginal victims in our communities and aboriginal people in our correctional facilities
6278262 our aboriginal community justice programs and victim support grants help to achieve these goals by building on the good work being done by our justice partners
6278263 the aboriginal community justice programs we support allow local communities to offer culturally appropriate ways to help aboriginal people deal with the criminal justice system
6278264 our government is pleased to support programs that help aboriginal people take responsibility for the administration of justice in their communities
6278265 its not so much about the content of the announcement but rather the process
6278266 here we have another example of the government rolling out a new program without first consulting the people who will be affected the most
6278267 holding a meeting one hour before the announcement as they did in this case is just not going to cut
6278268 to add to that it means that how those programs are going to look how theyre going to operate what theyre going to do
6278269 on some of the issues we have not been able to make progress
6278270 on the other hand it appears there will be substantial financial assistance to help people make their houses warm and dry
6278271 throughout his career bobby hughey has shown a commitment to public service
6278272 with his experience and abilities and a true dedication to his community i know that he will be a great judge for the people of canadian county and the state of oklahoma
6278273 with oil companies asking for more federal lands when they arent producing oil on most of their current leases it is time for congress to step in and insist on some accountability
6278274 the quickest way to produce more oil is to develop lands already under lease since exploration is underway and much of the infrastructure like miles and miles of pipeline is in place
6278275 john when are you going to start asking no demanding that the oil companies stop holding back on putting more oil into the pipeline
6278276 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6278277 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6278278 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6278279 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6278280 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6278281 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6278282 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6278283 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6278284 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6278285 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6278286 the echo chamber enhanced the flow at the block party keepin mc heads spinnin like dark bacardi his bac is 2 3 livers damaged but his lungs are joint free so inhale exhale breathe and get well kick something live stop chirpin like nextel im all in together swordsmans forever i paint the town red with many heads thats severed
6278287 liquid swords 2 when a new record is coming out
6278288 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6278289 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6278290 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6278291 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6278292 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6278293 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6278294 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6278295 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6278296 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6278297 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6278298 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6278299 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6278300 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6278301 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6278302 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6278303 there is no viable means for the commission staff to initiate an investigation into every single filer and compel production of their financial records without reason
6278304 in the early stages of our evolution we looked to the state and other agencies as models
6278305 it may be time for the city of san diego to consider whether they want to be the first jurisdiction to include statements of economic interest in their audit program
6278306 if it felt it was important to restore public confidence it could do it
6278307 id say no since 95 to 99 percent of people are complying with the law
6278308 theres a greater ability for the public and media to scrutinize statements of economic interest
6278309 the process is designed for the public official to disclose their economic interests so that the public can determine for themselves whether or not those interests are appropriate based on the decisions the public official is making
6278310 every year you have to fill it out and youre on notice that youre signing it under penalty of perjury most people are going to take it seriously and most people are aware that there are reporters and potential rivals out there looking at these things most people
6278311 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6278312 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6278313 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6278314 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6278315 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6278316 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6278317 for iluka 2008 represents a turning point the last year of major reliance on the western australian production base prior to the contribution of new production from the consolidated murray basin operations in 2009 followed by production commissioning and ramp up in the second half of 2010 of the jacinth ambrosia project in the eucla basin
6278318 despite a markedly higher average exchange rate than expected and the adverse impact of the gas supply disruption in western australia the company has recorded a first half npat which is within the range of the companys full year earnings guidance of 10 million to 20 million advised in february
6278319 the companys performance in the second half of 2008 will be subject to a range of variables including exchange rates and uncertainties related to the restoration of normal gas supplies in western australia at this stage our best estimate is that full year npat will be around 20 million
6278320 we have worked hard to strengthen ilukas competitive position and we are well placed to capitalise on more favourable industry dynamics
6278321 our willingness to adopt new approaches including establishing stocks to support spot sales and developing our ability to support containerised small lot parcels is reinforcing ilukas position in the fastest growing market for our products
6278322 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6278323 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6278324 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6278325 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6278326 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6278327 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6278328 this is a planning took where all things are going
6278329 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6278330 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6278331 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6278332 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6278333 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6278334 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6278335 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6278336 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6278337 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6278338 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6278339 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6278340 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6278341 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6278342 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6278343 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6278344 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6278345 overall the businesses we owned for the full year recorded a 15 per cent increase in revenue and 16 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax
6278346 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but i continue to strongly believe that the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6278347 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6278348 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6278349 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6278350 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6278351 they liked santoss result and 300 million buyback while financials continue their weak trend despite wall street overnight
6278352 they see them as another corporation theyre not public to city officials
6278353 what we struggled with each time was our inability to understand the salary increase situation and the lack of detailed information that we could get on the salary side of the budget
6278354 we raised it as an issue council raised it as an issue repeatedly we felt that there must have been something like that going on
6278355 there is a modicum of independence that is afforded to these corporations
6278356 with that there is an inherent risk that they will do bad things
6278357 that is not to say that sedc is not important
6278358 there was a general suspicion that the agency was not operating at peak performance
6278359 an issue here or an issue there no one had been able to track non performance
6278360 i have so many goals for that community and without the organization functioning properly those goals will not be met
6278361 it clearly took a chorus to say that there should have been a change
6278362 i dont know how a board of a city agency has more authority than the mayor in a serious situation when there are audits and investigations and tax dollars at risk
6278363 theres always some reluctance to go out on a limb by yourself
6278364 we used to be completely off the radar screen now were no 1 on the radar screen
6278365 but if we had been on the radar screen all along everything could have been handled differently it could have all been handled all right and we wouldnt have had to have this scandal
6278366 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6278367 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6278368 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6278369 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6278370 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6278371 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6278372 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6278373 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6278374 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6278375 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6278376 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6278377 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6278378 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6278379 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6278380 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6278381 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6278382 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6278383 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6278384 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6278385 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6278386 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6278387 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6278388 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6278389 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6278390 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6278391 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6278392 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6278393 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6278394 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6278395 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6278396 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6278397 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6278398 this is a tough industry and this is by any stretch of the imagination a pretty good result
6278399 very few countries in the world have what australia has at the moment which is effectively viable airlines across the board including obviously virgin
6278400 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6278401 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6278402 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6278403 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6278404 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6278405 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6278406 america was founded by people who believed that god was their rock of safety he is ours i recognize we must be cautious in claiming that god is on our side but i think its all right to keep asking if were on his side
6278407 lesperit de la democr cia no s una cosa mec nica que es pugui ajustar eliminant ne els seus formulismes sin que sha de canviar des del cor
6278408 el poder que ve del servei fidel ennobleix el poder que se cerca en nom del servei i que nom s es pot obtenir per la majoria dels vots s una il lusi i un parany que shan devitar
6278409 el poder imposat per la for a necessita sempre que lajudi la policia i els militars en canvi el poder originat des del cor els necessita poc per no dir gens
6278410 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6278411 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6278412 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6278413 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6278414 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6278415 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6278416 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6278417 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6278418 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6278419 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6278420 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6278421 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6278422 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6278423 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6278424 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6278425 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6278426 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6278427 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6278428 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6278429 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6278430 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6278431 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6278432 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6278433 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6278434 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6278435 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6278436 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6278437 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6278438 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6278439 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6278440 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6278441 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6278442 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6278443 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6278444 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6278445 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6278446 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6278447 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6278448 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6278449 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6278450 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6278451 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6278452 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6278453 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6278454 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6278455 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6278456 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6278457 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6278458 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6278459 oh so danielle our boss told me that youre taking over my saturday class
6278460 because i said i couldnt the 6 times he asked me last week
6278461 well if you already told him months ago that you cant teach it anymore and if i already told him i couldnt start then i guess its just his problem
6278462 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6278463 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6278464 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6278465 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6278466 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6278467 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6278481 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6278482 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6278483 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6278484 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6278492 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6278493 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6278494 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6278495 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6278512 every human activity now needs to be measured by its impact on water and the water commons
6278513 it is a flagrant violation of human rights when only the rich have access to clean water
6278514 its still easy for a policymaker to distance themselves from a purely environmental issue but it is much harder for them to ignore a public health issues
6278515 fifty years of development have wiped out local knowledge and skills about conserving and cooperating around water

6278523 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6278524 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water

6278526 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6278527 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6278528 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep

6278548 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6278549 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6278550 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6278565 the corporate and structured finance division will gradually be wound down mr larkin said
6278566 other assets and businesses not within the key areas of focus will be kept under review and divested or wound down as appropriate to maximise shareholder value
6278567 over the last few years in particular babcock amp brown has been very successful at achieving substantial growth based on the high levels of liquidity in the capital markets he said

6278643 he urges once again that the international community support the efforts of the government of algeria to combat terrorism
6278644 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6278645 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6278646 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6278647 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6278648 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria

6278659 while assisting other aides lifting the patient plaintiff suffered immediate severe pain
6278660 at the time the plaintiff and other aides were unable to use the lifting machine in assisting this patient therefore plaintiff and the others were attempting to place the patient into bed from the patients chair
6278661 as a result of such injury plaintiff has suffered with a central disc herniation hernia at u l5 that impressed on the ventral thecal sac
6278662 plaintiff would show that her injuries were proximately caused by the common law and statutory negligence of defendant
6278663 if these were just water why was his blood alcohol 04 several hours later
6278664 i dont from a tactical standpoint see the gain other than maybe hes trying to reach moderate democrat voters and take them from barack by putting lieberman there
6278665 but i think when you have a republican base that would probably not traditionally vote for a guy like lieberman i dont know why mccain would need to do that
6278666 joe lieberman has been a strong supporter of john mccain you cant take anything away from the level of support hes given to the senator
6278667 but for me personally i would expect that john mccain would privately have that conversation with joe lieberman and i would trust the senator to follow through on his word of having a pro life administration
6278668 im one of those people who is pro life and thinks that joe lieberman would make a terrific vice presidential selection by john mccain particularly here in new jersey where theres a large jewish population and a lot of jewish and non jewish voters have a lot of uneasiness about obamas commitment to israel
6278669 my greatest fear from a national security standpoint is that the terrorists are going to test barack obamas commitment to israel and i dont think hell treat israel as the 51st state
6278670 i think sen lieberman can make that point with great credibility with great conviction and with great clarity my view is that is one of the most if not the most important campaign issue
6278671 im certainly pleased that john mccain is pro life and thats why im supporting him im not going to not ratify or support a ticket if it did include someone who was by their own profession pro choice
6278672 we need more support or people will have to give up

6278676 to the lack of appropriate care by dr felix spiegel
6278677 felix spiegel m d appeals from the trial courts interlocutory order denying his motion to dismiss the health care liability claims of melissa strother
6278678 the order states an expert report and curriculum vitae were served on the defendant within 120 days of the filing of the petition because the service requirement of the statute was met we affirm the trial courts order
6278679 serve any objection to the sufficiency of the report not later than the 21st day after the date it was served failing which all objections are waived
6278680 the plaintiffs first delivered the report to spiegels office and then separately to his attorney during discovery after suit was filed but apparently prior to issuance of citation a private process server delivered the expert report and curriculum vitae to spiegels office in port neches
6278681 the process server handed the documents to the person behind the window at the doctors office however the process servers affidavit of service stated he served dr felix spiegel plaintiffs attorney filed a certificate of service that stated the doctor had been served with the report and curriculum vitae by a private process server
6278682 the proper objective of rules of civil procedure is to obtain a just fair equitable and impartial adjudication of the rights of litigants under established principles of substantive law
6278683 to the end that this objective may be attained with as great expedition and dispatch and at the least expense both to the litigants and to the state as may be practicable these rules shall be given a liberal construction
6278684 the plaintiffs daughter returned to see dr spiegel with continued complaints of abdominal pain and choking sensation and was seen by dr spiegels staff

6278711 that to gather news it is often necessary to agree either not to identify the source of information published or to publish only part of the facts revealed or both that if the reporter is nevertheless forced to reveal these confidences to a grand jury the source so identified and other confidential sources of other reporters will be measurably deterred from furnishing publishable information all to the detriment of the free flow of information protected by the first amendment
6278712 to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries
6278713 grand jury investigations instituted or conducted other than in good faith official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt a reporters relationship with his news sources would have no justification

6278762 and i was very conscious of the fact ath has to be successful because if it is not it will be deemed as a total failure of the public enterprise reform process

6278777 self recognition once thought to be an ability enjoyed only by select primates has now been demonstrated in a bird
6278778 the finding has raised questions about part of the brain called the neocortex something the self aware magpie does not even possess
6278779 in humans the ability to recognise oneself in a mirror develops around the age of 18 months and coincides with the first signs of social behaviour
6278780 so called mirror mark tests where a mark is placed on the animal in such a way that it can only be observed when it looks at its reflection have been used to sort the self aware beasts from the rest
6278781 of hundreds tested in addition to humans only four apes bottlenose dolphins and asian elephants have passed muster
6278782 helmut prior at goethe university in frankfurt and his colleagues applied a red yellow or black spot to a place on the necks of five magpies
6278783 the stickers could only be seen using a mirror then he gave the birds mirrors catch a glimpsethe feel of the mark on their necks did not seem to alarm them
6278784 but when the birds with coloured neck spots caught a glimpse of themselves they scratched at their necks a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own
6278785 those who received a black sticker invisible against the black neck feathers did not react
6278786 self recognition was thought to reside in the neocortex but birds dont have one
6278787 the authors suggest that self recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of convergent evolution where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits although they arrive at them via different routes
6278788 de waal agrees magpies are known for their ability to steal shiny objects and to hide away their loot

6278822 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6278823 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6278824 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6278830 when we came to know that the crucial email was sent from haywoods computer our first reaction was to question all his neighbours in his building at sanpada visitors to the buildings and even residents of neighbouring buildings about 1 000 persons were questioned with the help of computer experts then we reversed the investigation by focusing on haywood
6278831 we zeroed in on 12 persons with whom haywood was closely interacting and one of them turned out to be ali haywood told us that he interacted with ali a person with links in lucknow in his professional capacity as an english language trainer we are trying to ascertain if ali was the person who gave haywoods email id to abdul subhan quereshi the computer wizard who is suspected to have sent the terror email through the americans laptop
6278832 since the results of a polygraph tests are inconclusive and the ats felt that haywood was telling the complete truth we decided to conduct the narco test on him he obviously fled when he came to know about this

6278837 we have sold about 90 rifles in the last seven days and are flooded with queries
6278838 we had parents accompanied by even eight to nine year olds looking for air rifles this is undoubtedly a welcome change
6278839 i had done a short training course at the rifle club but left the sport as i felt there was no future but i can see a ray of hope now so i bought this gun and have begun practising again
6278840 i always wanted to have a gun and bindras show in beijing gave me the reason i have bought an air gun for rs 2 750 and will first set my aim right and then go for a professional training after getting a gun licence
6278841 i aim to become the next bindra i bought an air gun on a day after bindras model medal show in beijing i have already spoken to a shooting coach in nagpur and would be soon joining his academy and will initially practice on air gun
6278842 one needs to put in a lot of money to take shooting as a sport but for cash rich gujaratis that shouldnt be a deterrent all they needed was inspiration
6278843 we have seen a 15 to 20 per cent jump in sales in the local as well as national market
6278844 after rajyavardhan rathore bagged silver for india in 2004 at summer olympics the number of youngsters trooping for the shooting training camp increased by at least 15 to 20 but bindras feat seems to have doubled the rush and many are showing interest in the sport but only time will tell gujarat produce an olympic champion
6278845 hbk world school has not sought permission for the school hence we have sent a notice to the authorities we are also considering sending a notice to cambridge board informing them of the incident and requesting them to withdraw their affiliation to the school
6278846 the building is an unauthorized structure we had served them a notice two years ago they did not comply with the rules of auda and so this second notice is being sent the building has not been sealed yet
6278847 in 1998 the building came into existence land issue and the problem of bu permission has been there since then the builder and the owner of the previous school have to pay almost rs 8 to 10 crore to the authorities as fine if we are asked we will pay the fine without doubt

6278852 its one that i will almost certainly have to refer for policy guidance to higher quarters
6278853 it was definitely done to overshadow their opening night and it worked

6278868 when laws like mcoca in maharashtra and kcoca in karnataka are approved by the centre there is little reason why gujcoc should not be given presidential assent
6278869 the bill was sent to the union home ministry in 2003 for presidential assent on the government of indias request we made necessary changes in it during 2004 and sent it again for presidential assent the chief minister has personally represented to the prime minister for this
6278870 it is unfortunate that in the absence of gucoc the gujarat government has to depend on indian penal code and criminal procedure code gujarat is a border state and stopping organized crime here is in national interest present laws are not sufficient to fight such dangers
6278871 in gujcoc the voluntary admission by the accused is considered a testimony and any other evidence is not needed it provides for strongest possible punishment including death penalty

6278934 based on a tip off we arrested chhetri and recovered 90 tablets of nitrosen 10 and 144 tablets of spasmoproxivon from him during the preliminary interrogation he told us that he had collected the sedatives from siliguri chhetri could not show us any documents to prove that he is a medicine trader
6278935 he told us that he was carrying the tablets to darjeeling we will interrogate him further to know how he could procure the tablets without any valid document
6278936 we have instructed all our members not to sell scheduled drugs like sedatives without prescription if any druggist is found to be flouting rules authorities are free to take action against him on our part we will immediately cancel his membership
6278937 only commercial vehicles registered in siliguri can get fitness certificates from my office here for permits the owners need to approach the rto in darjeeling
6278938 for all other vehicles registered in darjeeling both permits and fitness certificates have to be obtained from there
6278939 but because of this ban imposed by the morcha we could not renew the documents and as many as 90 per cent of the vehicles that go to the hills and back have permits and fitness certificates that have expired

6278970 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world with special focus on sanitation
6278971 the number of people living without a supply of improved drinking water has now dropped well below one billion
6278972 more than half the global population now have water piped to their homes and the number of people using unimproved water supplies continues to decline
6278973 the regional sanitation conferences for example such as latinosan africasan easan and sacosan produced unprecedented declarations that provide a strong foundation for developing the water and sanitation sector in these regions

6278979 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
6278980 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
6278981 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
6278982 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
6278983 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on

6279233 an interesting outcome of the report details that while consumers are on the whole are happy with their current tyres they dont necessarily choose the same brand when replacing them consumers typically have been more aware of tyre brands but courtesy of internet based research and independent information are now able to identify specific details about tread patterns and why certain tread patterns are more suitable for tyre retailers this means that there is more opportunity to integrate internet based marketing information with appropriate point of sale information
6279234 the internet is growing in its popularity in educating consumers and subsequently people are seeking better information from tyre manufacturers when it matters most at point of sale traditional advertising needs to be combined with marketing that focuses on product differentiation general tyre education and safety programs with retail environments that improve the sales experience for that particular brand tyre manufacturers that now cater for both female and male purchasing habits in the new online space and traditional retail channel are going to benefit the most the game certainly has changed

6279267 imports are surging in value which shows that high crude oil prices continue to hurt corporate revenues and are leading to an outflow of income from japan
6279268 arm yourselves and be courageous be ready early in the morning to fight with these gentiles who have assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary the temple it is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary but as his will in heaven may be so shall he do
6279269 o my fellow soldiers there is no time more opportune than the present for courage and contempt of dangers for if you now fight bravely you may recover your liberty which though it is a desirable to all people is much more desirable for us since it gives us the liberty to worship god so since you are in the present circumstances you must either recover that liberty and so regain a happy and blessed way of living which is that according to our laws and the customs of our country or submit to the most opprobrious sufferings no seed of your nation will remain if you lose this battle so fight bravely assuming that you must die even if you do not fight keep in mind that besides such glorious rewards as those of the liberty of your country of your laws and of your religion you shall then obtain everlasting glory prepare yourselves therefore and put yourselves into such an agreeable posture that you may be ready to fight with the enemy as soon as it is day tomorrow morning
6279270 accurately describe what is contained in jewish records without adding anything to what is therein contained or taking away anything therefrom
6279271 this was the speech which judas made to encourage them
6279272 this affects how christians live because we believe in the paradox that the world is a good place but that it is influenced by forces of evil that will never be fully overcome until jesus return
6279273 that fallen angels have taken control of creation and that the justice of god who has effectively relinquished control will only be seen at the end of time when wickedness reaches its climax and god steps in to end history destroying the wicked and vindicating the righteous
6279274 apocalypticism is pervasive in the new testament that puts the burden of proof on people who want to get rid of it rather than on people who want to keep it
6279275 what you worship as unknown this i proclaim to you
6279276 if you have seen me you have seen the father

6279278 to say the time is short just means the time is now
6279279 if you dont find salvation in christ then you dont really want what i have to offer anyway
6279280 so you either stay where you are or else you find a church where you feel comfortable
6279281 this breaks down to the argument between evangelical christians and secular humanists
6279282 right off the bat it has immediately become one of the largest sales this year in the country
6279283 i think even in this tough environment that was pretty attractive
6279284 that have the potential to do well no matter what the general market cycle is
6279285 you cant totally separate the property from austin because austin is what makes those tenants thrive its a great market for growing tech companies so its all interrelated
6279286 weve seen a tremendous drop in the mega deals we saw last year
6279287 theyre almost nonexistent this year lenders are being very selective on who they loan to and to which markets theyre loaning into geographically
6279288 in a challenging national office sales market the fact that a transaction of this magnitude can be completed in austin underscores the long term strength of the market
6279289 they now control large office properties in both the southwest and northwest submarkets
6279290 spear street invests in markets that have a strong tech base attractive quality of life and above average growth potential so austin and the riata office investment is a good match not too many investment properties of this size and price are trading hands due to the difficult credit markets but spear street obviously has the resources to make it happen
6279291 simplemente es algo que tengo que hacer trabajo pago mis impuestos y no hago da o a nadie

6279294 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
6279295 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
6279296 there are a couple of precursors to us making the offer
6279297 one is we want to make the offer in the native language of the build that youre running and were having text localized and translated now
6279298 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week

6279302 saya gembira kini bpr aktif menjalankan siasatan dan membuat tangkapan hasil daripada penambahbaikan terhadap agensi itu dari segi pertambahan bilangan pegawai dan kemudahan untuk membuat penyiasatan
6279303 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
6279304 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6279305 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6279306 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
6279307 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
6279308 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
6279309 its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee
6279310 these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know before hand you want him to tell you this is how i see it
6279311 the irb rugby committee agreed that no meetings take place with match officials so that no undue pressure was placed on them prior to matches
6279312 no other sport meets with the referee before hand and all teams with the exception of south africa have been very happy with this process
6279313 teams can and have contacted me with issues before games and national coaches are invited to report back on refereeing performances after internationals 80 per cent of the teams do so and this is a very useful resource for the irb referee selection committee
6279314 complaining about refereeing through the media is not the forum with which referees will be reviewed
6279315 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
6279316 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
6279317 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
6279318 y si ma ana hubiese una guerra y no fuese nadie a lucharla

6279334 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6279335 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6279336 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis

6279343 tried to cancel this contract since i was within my 30 days it took me 2 days with at amp t after convincing them that one of the phone was purchased off ebay instead of having them making me take the phone back to an apple store

6279394 on monday victor p stabile cumberland county gop chairman on behalf of the john mccain campaign filed with the court of the commonwealth of pennsylvania a petition to have bob barr removed from the ballot in that state for those of you who receive the campaign updates from russ verney and shane cory via e mail you are already aware of the lawsuits existence earlier today the campaign received a copy of the suit which alleges that an intentional substitution violation of pennsylvania law was committed as the libertarian party attempted to gain the 24 666 required signatures for inclusion on the ballot the signature requirement for third party candidates and independents who seek ballot access in pennsylvania is greater than twelve times the number required for either the democrats or the republicans the campaign and the state party were able to collect over 47 000 valid elector signatures since february when this massive undertaking began
6279395 the challenge to the substitution process is completely frivolous it flies in the face of extremely well established case law as the mccain campaign and the republican party know full well and may well be dismissed out of hand by the commonwealth court the lack of moral integrity from the mccain campaign doesnt surprise me but the sheer lameness of this tactic does it shows how pathetically desperate the mccain campaign is to stop bob barr

6279410 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

6279439 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic p recept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me and notion of that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class i mean there is a purvasive sic sense i think that this country is wealthy and powerful as we still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these

6279470 an even greater percentage of voters than in june now see mccain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
6279471 the obama campaigns behavior during the georgia crisis vindicated the suspicions of many that obama is not up to speed on major international conflicts
6279472 his campaign was vague and slow to react in their response to the russian invasion its clear that obama is within the mainstream of berkeley calif in terms of the security and defense issues that concern american voters
6279473 i think voters are aware of the candidates life stories and exposure to the crises including mccains career as a naval officer in time of war and his work over many years in foreign affairs issues that came before congress and have concluded that is better preparation to be a crisis manager than being a state senator in illinois
6279474 a lot of it is because obama is not well known among undecideds and also has low favorable numbers

6279625 there are implications to dedicating more and more crop land to fuel production rather than food production

6279676 a marca o faz parte do futebol mas sab amos que as duas equipes t m jogadores de muita pegada e isso dificultaria a a o no meio campo algo normal em uma partida decisiva
6279677 ele deu um soco no meu pesco o e depois veio pedir desculpa infelizmente tem jogador que assim mesmo a gente tenta jogar futebol mas nem todo mundo pensa assim
6279678 n s fizemos 1 a 0 tivemos chances para ampliar e n o conseguimos a falhamos na bola parada e levamos o empate n s t nhamos combinado uma marca o forte nesse tipo de lance mas falhamos de novo

6279755 hari ini merupakan perayaan ulang tahun pertama kami tidak ingin mulukmuluk sebenarnya kami hanya menginginkan sebuah berita yang bisa menyediakan dua sisi pandangan cover both side narasumber prinsip tersebut jarang dipakai oleh media mainstream khususnya di media portal mereka hanya mengejar kecepatan dan isu hangat tapi melupakan sisi terpenting tadi
6279756 dengan menjadi nomor dua kami tidak memiliki beban untuk menyaingi portal besar yang sudah mapan kami hanya ingin menjadi majalah dinding mading bagi kawula muda terpelajar dari seluruh indonesia bahkan dunia
6279757 di hari ke depan kami bakal melakukan kegiatan kumpul bareng gathering dan mengadakan pelatihan jurnalistik workshop foto editing dan sebagainya untuk kontributor pokoknya untuk semua siswa yang berminat terjun ke dunia media kami pun akan terus menambah jaringan kontributor termasuk dengan masyarakat umum agar tulisan kami lebih luas dan mencakup seluruh lapisan masyarakat
6279758 yang membuat portal dua berita menarik adalah banyak agenda kampus dan dunia anak sekolah yang sedang in ditampilkan selain itu tokoh tokoh ekonomi yang sering mengisi di kolom kolomnya juga berkompeten patut dijadikan referensilah oleh anak muda yang tidak suka ribet
6279759 i think what we see here confirms my observation that there is widespread disenchantment with the two major party nominees something that has simply not been adequately measured before this poll
6279760 there is a leaderless grass roots movement out there to boycott both mccain and obama in 2008 to make a statement to demand better candidates in the future from better parties this could be a historic election for non participation in a year with no high profile third party alternatives
6279761 it doesnt matter who you vote for all politicians are the same
6279762 the high percentage of americans not voting undecided choosing a third party alternative or planning to write in their own choice in spite of the media saturation coverage of the two man horserace strongly suggests deep voter dissatisfaction with obama and mccain
6279763 we also have to work the the dark side if you will weve got to spend time in the shadows of the intelligence world
6279764 a lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies if were going to be successful

6279808 mudah mudahan bila dikehendaki rakyat saya bisa masuk sebagai anggota dewan naluri saya untuk terus mengkritisi setiap kebijakan pemerintah 18 tahun pengalaman saya menjadi aktivis kini saya merasa sudah saatnya bersuara dari dalam dan akan makin kencang lagi dalam bersikap
6279809 berteriak saat pemerintah mengeluarkan kebijakan yang tidak pro rakyat sementara partai partai lain bersikap melunak atas kebijakan pemerintah yang tidak pro rakyat
6279810 aksi lepas dollar as masih berlanjut sehingga mendorong rupiah menguat tidak ada faktor lain yang mendorong kenaikan mata uang lokal itu
6279811 jadi bisa saja rupiah kembali tertekan apabila isu negatif dari eksternal muncul
6279812 rencana pemerintah itu merupakan isu positif yang juga akan memberikan dukungan terhadap pergerakan pasar uang domesti lebih lanjut khususnya rupiah
6279813 bertahannya suku bunga boj itu mengakibatkan pelaku asing cenderung melepas yen dan mendorong dollar as menguat
6279814 daerah dekat sini sekarang sudah banyak dipenuhi bangunan jadi cari rumputnya agak jauhan apalagi kalau musim kemarau seperti sekarang kita bisa cari rumput sampai slipi maupun tomang jakarta barat
6279815 untuk satu ikat rumput yang semula dimakan oleh dua sampai tiga sapi kini dimakan oleh empat sampai lima sapi karena rumput sudah mulai sulit didapat sebagai gantinya kita beri ampas tahu
6279816 kalau yang dewasa dibutuhkan 10 kilogram ampas tahu kalau yang masih berusia satu tahun ke bawah kita beri separuhnya pemberian ampas tahu dilakukan bersama dengan campuran lainnya seperti konsentrat dan singkong yang telah diiris kecil kecil
6279817 satu ekor sapi perah dewasa dalam satu hari memerlukan ampas tahu 10 kilogram singkong satu kilogram dan konsentrat setengah kilogram sedangkan untuk yang berusia satu tahun ke bawah separuhnya
6279818 biasanya isi ampas tahu nggak sampai penuh satu karung paling cuma setengah atau tiga perempat ukuran karung
6279819 di kawasan mega kuningan ada sekitar 30 pengusaha home industri pembuat tahu yang ampas tahunya bisa digunakan untuk makanan sapi perah dan kambing
6279820 kalau sapi di pegunungan bisa 20 liter sehari di sini paling 15 liter sehari
6279821 dengan banyaknya gedung bertingkat dan bangunan yang memakai kaca di sekitar sini suhu jadi lebih panas
6279822 persoalannya bukan pada usia pesawat tetapi perawatan komponen pesawat yang harus intensif dan ini yang sulit untuk dilakukan maskapai kita karena mahalnya biaya perawatan tersebut
6279823 jadi bukan masalah usia armada pesawatnya kalau lion mengembalikan md82 sebagai contoh di as armada pesawat usianya mencapai 30 tahun tetapi karena perawatannya bagus ya masih bisa dipakai
6279824 apa saja dihajar tidak ada pantangan makan semangkuk bubur saja sate jeroannya bisa delapan tusuk
6279825 dulu sih berat saya masih normal setelah kerja malah terus naik awalnya ukuran celana 33 lalu naik naik sampai terakhir ukuran 46 baju juga ganti terus dari l xl dobel xl sampai 4 xl
6279826 tiap tahun di kantor ada general check up paling dokter menganjurkan agar saya kontrol makan masalahnya saya tidak tahu bagaimana memulainya paling paling saya hanya minum obat pelangsing tubuh tapi enggak ada efeknya maklum pola makan saya masih kacau gorengan jeroan daging tetap dilahap habis
6279827 iseng iseng saya ke toko buku beli buku diet golongan darah langsung saya baca sampai habis dari situ saya jadi paham apa saja makanan yang baik untuk dikonsumsi buah misalnya yang paling bagus untuk saya adalah nanas pepaya dan apel
6279828 saya pantang makan daging sebab untuk golongan darah ab daging baru hancur setelah diproses tiga hari kalau makan daging terus akhirnya lemak menumpuk kabohidrat juga harus sangat dikurangi tapi orang diet masih perlu protein
6279829 harus banyak minum air putih pagi bisa habis 1 5 liter minuman manis sudah saya hindari
6279830 dua bulan pertama hanya makan gado gado malamnya cuma makan buah
6279831 saya jalan kaki keliling kompleks rumah di saat lain jalan jalan di mal tanpa harus belanja kalau dihitung hanya perlu jalan kaki sejauh 5 km
6279832 saya cerita ke teman sudah berhasil menurunkan berat badan eh saya malah dimarahi karena pola yang saya terapkan terlalu drastis kata si teman saya harus mengonsumsi protein
6279833 pagi masih sama tapi siangnya saya tambah protein bisa ikan bakar atau rebus kadang juga daging ayam rebus tanpa kulit nasi tak lebih dari 10 sendok nah sayurnya harus lebih banyak ketimbang nasi itu pun tak boleh sayur bersantan
6279834 tapi saya sudah niat banget pokoknya di hati sudah terpatri makanan enak tapi enggak sehat harus saya stop makanya saat teman makan steak saya sudah tidak tertarik memang sih godaan ada saja terkadang meski habis makan perut melilit minta diisi maklum sebelumnya kan biasa makan dengan porsi besar nah kalau rasa lapar muncul saya banyakin minum air putih atau makan buah
6279835 terus terang saya katakan sedang diet mereka menghargai kok pernah juga harus hadir di undangan jamuan makan malam tapi enggak masalah toh saya bisa makan buah
6279836 masih banyak kok pilihan makanan termasuk kalau makan nasi padang kan bisa pilih sayur singkong dan ikan bakar yang pasti enggak usah pakai kuah bersantan
6279837 sebenarnya istri saya bilang sudah cukup tapi target saya adalah celana ukuran 30 setelah itu tinggal mempertahankan
6279838 yang jelas saya tambah gesit badan juga enteng dulu naik tangga saja napas sudah ngos ngosan sekarang sih enteng saja
6279839 salah satu syaratnya kan pakai ktp petugas bank sampai tidak percaya foto yang ada di ktp itu foto saya saya sampai harus mengeluarkan semua kartu identitas bahkan menunjukkan foto di laptop
6279840 banyak lho yang tanya saya sih tak keberatan membagi pengalaman
6279841 enggak sebenarnya sih duitnya lumayan tapi ada beban moral karena saya kan enggak pakai obat pelangsing
6279842 semula saya treadmill tapi sekarang lebih suka sepeda statis seminggu bisa 3 4 kali berlatih
6279843 sampai mahasiswa masih saja doyan makan enggak ada pantangan saya juga tak pernah rendah diri diejek teman sih sudah biasa ada yang manggil ikan paus dan seterusnya saya ketawa saja malah saya bikin lelucon
6279844 tetap saja enggak berhasil sekitar dua tahun lalu saya memutuskan untuk rajin fitnes dan diet meski diet bukan berarti enggak bisa makan enak lho
6279845 siang saya makan 5 sendok nasi merah 2 potong tahu atau tempe bacem 1 potong dada ayam panggang dan tumis buncis sore saya makan lagi 1 atau 2 jam sebelum fitnes dengan menu 5 sendok makan nasi merah 1 potong dada ayam ditumis dengan sayuran 1 mangkuk sup tomat setelah fitnes saya makan 1 buah jeruk sunkist

6279901 welcome to adulthood except when it comes to beverage choice
6279902 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past
6279903 were mortgaging the future of people who cant vote and might not even be born yet
6279904 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances
6279905 the factors that caused the mortgage based subprime crisis to explode exist for the governments finances the difference is its 25 times at least bigger
6279906 our trade equation guarantees massive foreign investment in the u s when we force feed 2 billion daily to the rest of the world they must invest in something here
6279907 sometimes when im saving up for something my mind change at the last minute
6279908 kami tetap akan berikan bukti yang ada pada bank jika diminta kejaksaan seperti bukti alur dana yang diduga masuk rekening pribadi setelah dana kredit dicairkan sebab dana itu diduga sempat masuk rekening bendahara pengelola pinjaman bukan langsung masuk kas daerah kami nanti akan sampaikan bukti penarikan rekening bendahara serta bukti rekening kas daerah
6279909 mungkin bisa saja kasusnya berbeda dulu yang bersangkutan mukhtar ismail menjalani hukuman atas kesalahan pengelolaan dana deposito fiktif itu jelas ada tindak pidana bank
6279910 dijadikan tersangka kan belum tentu bersalah tetap harus ada asas praduga tak bersalah yang harus dibuktikan di pengadilan
6279911 saya tidak mengetahui soal itu bisa saja penegak hukum melihat kasusnya berbeda mungkin mantan anak buah saya ini dijadikan tersangka terkait prosedural pembukaan rekeningnya dan pengelolaan rekening itu sendiri sebab dana ini milik kas daerah kenapa masuk ke rekening bendahara pengelola pinjaman
6279912 bisa saja kasus ini muncul awalnya karena adanya keinginan untuk membantu memberikan pelayanan tapi ternyata salah awalnya bertujuan mengendalikan penggunaan kredit agar terarah sesuai peruntukannya membangun sarana infrastruktur bukit pelangi tapi memberikan pelayanan terbaik bukan berarti melalaikan norma aturan yang akhirnya muncul masalah itu tentu menjadi tanggung jawab pejabat bank jika memberikan pelayanan cepat namun melanggar
6279913 kasus ini mengindikasikan adanya ketidaktertiban pejabat bank dalam pelaksanaan tugas yang sesuai tata kelola prinsip penerapan bekerja sesuai norma aturan yang ada tetap menjadi keharusan di bank
6279914 misalnya untuk mengelola kas daerah harus ada aturan pengelolaan mengeluarkan sesuai penggunaannya menggunakan spmu surat perintah membayar uang red sumbernya juga harus jelas

6279937 further division of west bengal is unacceptable and the gjmm leadership should redraw its political strategy keeping this reality in view
6279938 yet any demand related to further division of the state is absolutely unacceptable the sooner the gjmm leadership gives up the unrealistic demand the better for the darjeeling hills and the state as a whole
6279939 the cpi as a party is not against the idea of formation of smaller states but gorkhaland demand is unacceptable because it is economically not viable besides we have learnt in course of our experiences that a mere formation of a new state does not prove to be a panacea as far as development is concerned
6279940 the bengalis who as a community were in the forefront of struggle for freedom have already experienced the grim pangs of division and under no circumstances would it acquiesce to further bifurcation of the state
6279941 i met him twice with some road development projects but he rejected all our projects accusing us of unduly infringing on the dghc jurisdiction
6279942 my party counsels the gjmm leadership to give up the unattainable gorkhaland demand and to concentrate on the economic development of the region
6279943 tourists come to jaldapara wildlife sanctuary and other forests in the region to watch large animals like rhinos and elephants but they are often disappointed as the animals are not sighted always our intention is to inform the visitors that apart from large animals the area is the habitat of a lot of small creatures particularly butterflies now we are working in chilapata mendabari kodal basti and cc line forests

6279952 heather is very responsive intuitive supportive and patient with all my questions and has now transformed my blog which i absolutely love i think that what stands out most of all to me about heather is her integrity she follows the guidelines set out by stampin up regarding the release of information and i admire that quality about her

6279959 what we talking about is recognizing there is a very clear responsibility on the part of industry government can never regulate or inspect its way to total food safety
6279960 but for heavens sake we ought to make the system better not increase the risk

6279970 i treat flying the same im always fizzing after a flight and this pitts special aircraft is like the worlds greatest rollercoaster
6279971 unfortunately australia doesnt have much data coming out so we took direction from the us dollar and commodity prices
6279972 although the us economy is weaker it does seem the global markets are pricing in a loosening of monetary policy with the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the reserve bank of new zealand
6279973 although the news is still grim for the us the rest of the world is starting to catch up

6279983 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
6279984 it seems like the democrats idea of bipartisanship is you vote our way or you dont vote
6279985 this is laughable republicans have filibustered a record 80 pieces of legislation in this session so far

6279990 intellectual property has become just another area of federal practice
6279991 there are plenty of smaller companies that want to use smaller law firms for patent litigation
6279992 it really comes down to what kind of attention you want your law firm to give you and since were not a microsoft attention is critical
6279993 but cost is also a major factor behind choosing a boutique
6279994 general practice firms overstaff cases something boutiques just dont do
6279995 but i find there is more flexibility on staffing and pricing arrangements at boutiques
6279996 its great when youre as knowledgeable about the science and technology behind a patent as the other sides expert witnesses
6279997 when lawyers understand the technology its more efficient less time needed from our engineers and lower fees for us
6279998 its hard for a general practice firm to make patent prosecution profitable
6279999 a patent prosecution practice requires a whole different docketing system and financial management system and large firms often have a hard time implementing the systems needed
