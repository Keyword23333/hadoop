2300004 percy took a little bit of a step back and theres still some pain there
2300005 youll probably see us catch a whole lot of balls this year
2300006 were trying to make it as hard as possible for teams not to predict what were going to do
2300007 were going to move around a lot weve got tight ends with the ability to get open they get the ball to us
2300008 well do some disguised formations some motions some shifts to uncover a guy that needs to touch the ball
2300009 its pretty simple when it all boils down if youve got a playmaker or a couple of playmakers and in some cases you are really fortunate to have multiple playmakers figure out what they do best and then put them in situations to be successful
2300010 it would be great to have a guy thats a mismatch player at that position im talking about in the passing game and theres only been a few of those even in pro football but im going to tell you thats one of the difficult things to defend
2300011 if theyre all productive well try to play all of them
2300012 im pleased with the tight ends that we have and we do have some guys that need to develop and improve if they continue to develop were going to have a good situation at that position
2300013 i just feel like were going to have a real big year
2300014 weve got a chance for a lot of tight ends to play this year we have the bodies and were real excited about it
2300015 last year my agent rang me and said youve been offered an incredibly big million pound deal

2300020 why do so many problems pass by completely unnoticed by the non initiator perception factors affecting non initiators are part of the reason but there are some other significant differences non initiators for example may settle into marriage roles that are more comfortable and secure regardless of how their mates feel the non initiator may be a weaker marriage partner in communication and intimacy he or she may view the marriage more as an institution to be preserved rather than a dynamic relationship confrontation can be deflected by interruptions or distractions the non initiator may externalize and depersonalize matters more to avoid any introspection about serious difficulties
2300021 when the initiator confronts the non initiator with problems denial is quite often immediate
2300022 i am king is a statement about all men we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kings it has nothing to do with being arrogant i am king is not a statement about myself i am king is about every man who is going to go and buy the fragrance

2300057 these are the first gdp gross domestic product figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2300058 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavorable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2300059 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2300060 the vast majority of the people at all three sites are hourly workers and you dont take 500 hourly workers off the job and not have it have an impact
2300061 nothing in terms of an offer to come back to the table that is something that were keeping the lines of communication open and should they want to wed be ready to go as soon as possible
2300062 the people that are management have been let through the picket line but were setting up for what we consider to be a long strike
2300063 nobody wants a strike but at this point in time the members feel that given the economic boom for the corporation its time to share the wealth
2300064 there may be some short term disruptions but our plans are certainly to carry on with our expansion work i would not anticipate the target dates would change
2300065 were having a slight disagreement right now about compensation but weve got excellent workers and by all accounts it has been quite peaceful at all three sites
2300066 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2300067 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2300068 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around us 3 50 for labour day
2300069 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2300070 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2300071 the fact of the matter is that the canadian dollar is not the worst performing currency of the day
2300072 in terms of the g10 currencies its actually one of the better performing
2300073 it would suggest technically that over the next few months the potential to move up to the c 1 08 to c 1 10 range for u s dollar canada
2300074 youve got two years around 2 72 percent which is more than a quarter below the bank of canada rate so that gives you an idea of what the market thinks the bank of canada is going to be doing going forward
2300075 corporate canada is beginning to think the worst and the result has been a summer crop of pink slips
2300076 the jobs trend is consistent with weak positive growth at best and our call for a roughly one per cent gain in real output is in line with that reality and perhaps a tad optimistic
2300077 the banks are more cautious about capital preservation so youre going to see both the share repurchases and the dividend increases be very slow if any
2300078 and with that kind of a trend they are going to be pretty conservative about dishing out more in the way of dividends right now
2300079 the days of high double digit growth are over for a while and the banks are just concentrating more on keeping their balance sheets and everything else clean
2300080 so the banks are going to wait until at least the last quarter and maybe even next year before you start to see any dividend increases
2300081 i think both banks probably feel it is important to continue that dividend pattern so i dont think those two banks will miss dividend increase opportunities
2300082 so theyll do it but i suspect the dividend increases are going to be tiny
2300083 the absence of good economic news and the overwhelming weight of the decline in commodity prices is enough to sink our market
2300084 even though the economic news the jobs report wasnt good this morning what people are seeing is the lower oil prices tend to be good news for all the other sectors
2300085 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2300086 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2300087 this was a very good showing in the middle of an economic slowdown

2300190 it was rough my first time ever on the dl
2300191 but i think i really learned a lot from it
2300192 it was just a matter of some thing needing to happen for me to get that chance believe me i was very excited when i got the call that i was coming to pittsburgh
2300193 i like the talent of the other three but im telling you the guy i like and the guy i think pittsburgh is going to like is karstens all he does is throw strikes and compete hes not going to blow you away but hell battle you
2300194 im not one of those guys whos going to light up the radar gun
2300195 im going to put the ball in play thats just who i am
2300196 he pitches to contact goes right after guys and he has no problem with that
2300197 he has a plan knows what he wants to do and attacks if he gets hit he keeps coming
2300198 if youre in the field you love to have that
2300199 honestly when someone trades for you it makes you feel wanted not to say i wasnt wanted in new york but there was an abundance of arms to get out of there and come and have a real opportunity to pitch ill take it and ill take full advantage of it
2300200 that pitch with the 0 2 count kind of got my attention
2300201 but in all seriousness thats the best stuff ive seen him have in four or five years he had a lot of life on his fastball and his slider was very deceptive he was really good
2300202 my customer and sales experience really help in my philanthropic endeavors
2300203 ive had an opportunity to do a lot of things now i want to give back a little bit
2300204 if he has a goal in mind hes going to achieve it
2300205 im just trying to let some of it sink in
2300206 from where i was watching i think there might have been no more than a handful of times where he didnt put his pitch where he wanted to
2300207 because i knew theyd watch tape of what i did in chicago
2300208 i knew he had all the offspeed stuff that he showed the cubs but i didnt know he could locate his fastball like that
2300209 after the first inning i thought it was going to be a long day
2300210 i was lucky its a big park and i had j mike out there running them down
2300211 when you show emotion the other team feeds off it
2300212 it was a quick head jerk and then i thought all right weve got two outs
2300213 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2300214 are you kidding me i have a migraine too mom
2300215 i just noticed you know that the olympics started today and that was the only special thing i really knew about it
2300216 my friend brought up the point the other day you want to hope he come on friday because you know friday is 8 8 08 and i was like okay
2300217 im one of the ones that probably could care less but long as its not a 6 6 6 thing and a friday the 13th thing im good
2300218 ill probably want to have somebody play it for me today to play the lottery for me today

2300222 weve talked a very long time about the subject not only myself but many other people
2300223 whether hans would summon up the intestinal fortitude to do this he did
2300224 there was no difficulty once he got on the job
2300225 it was so obscure but i admit it was also clever because it was not that far off the road
2300226 from a d a s perspective they would never do that
2300227 if the family leaned on them so hard that they wanted to know where the body was
2300228 it just doesnt seem right to me that that can happen in america
2300229 the show they put on and the circus they put on over the past year i think they put so much dirt on nina now theyre going to have to get themselves out of the dirt
2300230 hans would not do this without any kind of deal there is no other way
2300231 the possibility of this has been known for a little while but this is the first time weve seen it done
2300232 users downloading from p2p networks need to exercise caution anyway but should also be sensitive to pop ups appearing upon playing a downloaded video or audio stream
2300233 i never allow programs to choose which codecs i use to play back media
2300234 i research it and get the codec bundles off of sites i know to be trustworthy and even then i still scan them and check to make sure they are what they are i honestly dont feel that this malware has a very good chance of spreading fast
2300235 i think that outside a minority of users who really know about all the dangers implied with internet use the vast majority of people have no idea that such a codec download could lead to a trojan infection
2300236 we must not allow television programs to become trojan horses
2300237 carrying messages that would otherwise be criticized by the public or even deemed illegal
2300238 as the use of product placement and product integration in television programs continues to expand broadcasters and cable operators should comply in a meaningful way with their statutory obligation to identify what entity is behind sponsored programming and what product is being pitched
2300239 i think what theyre saying is that you can give a person a few oreos and theyll talk to you
2300240 beyond an identification which is reasonably related to the use of such service or property on the broadcast
2300241 american cars often have large engines using relatively old technology with lots of power but also low efficiency
2300242 im calling from omnicorps ltd and according to our predictive software theres a 97 8 chance youve just murdered your boyfriend now were obligated to pass this information on to the authorities which means the police are already on their way but before they arrive wed like to offer you the opportunity to take advantage of an exciting offer so if youd like to go to your window and look outside our escape van should be arriving any moment
2300243 its not tragic all right because its a multi player activity with real live friends in the room joining in even if i am ultimately a man in his mid 30s playing a plastic guitar
2300244 i think there was a lot of undercurrent of pressure not to rock the boat for a variety of reasons where it was corporate reasons or other considerations
2300245 there are horrors that were completely left out of this war
2300246 shes now a co anchor on a court tv show
2300247 difficult public face for nbc in a time of war he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti war anti bush and skeptical of the administrations motives
2300248 a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity
2300249 we just write down what people say its not our job to do anything else
2300250 delivered a passionate provocative and newsworthy speech raising all sorts of doubts about a possible invasion
2300251 involved her time on msnbc where she worked during the lead up to war
2300252 many people running the broadcasts wanted coverage that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the country at the time
2300253 these are the first gdp gross domestic product figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2300254 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavorable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2300255 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2300256 im just trying to let some of it sink in
2300257 from where i was watching there might have been no more than five times where he threw right over the middle of the plate
2300258 because i knew theyd watch tape of what i did in chicago
2300259 he mixed it up and threw us a bunch of fastballs early on
2300260 i knew he had all the offspeed stuff that he showed the cubs but i didnt know he could locate his fastball like that
2300261 it goes to show what you can do with three or four pitches if you throw strikes and go right after guys
2300262 hopefully some other guys in this room will pay attention to that
2300263 after the first inning i thought it was going to be a long day
2300264 i was lucky its a big park and i had j mike out there running them down
2300265 when you show emotion the other team feeds off it
2300266 it was a quick head jerk and then i thought all right weve got two outs
2300267 he was standing at the plate not intimidated by randy johnson anymore than he was intimidated on the mound
2300268 he goes right after guys hes not afraid even after the way those first couple innings went what did you see him do he just kept pitching
2300269 i wanted to know why he was nervous finally why was he tired
2300270 i told him i was tired from running the bases
2300271 this game has a lot of ups and downs right now ill take the ups im going to have fun with this have fun on the ride to philadelphia with the team and go from there
2300272 i dont know if many people would target this particular vulnerability because there probably are not a lot of coffee makers at the moment that are internet connected and in my case its behind a firewall
2300273 this is why connecting everything to the internet is a terrible idea

2300301 during the whole day russian jet planes have been continuously attacking georgian towns
2300302 they have been continuously attacking the town of gori in the middle of georgia which has nothing to do with south ossetia
2300303 russia cannot allow georgia to solve the south ossetia problem by military means
2300304 of course the deaths of russian peacekeepers and the destruction caused by the invading georgians is an important reason why medvedev has ordered russian forces to intervene in the conflict but there are bigger strategic reasons behind that moscow cannot let saakashvili succeed in his gamble
2300305 it happened so fast i didnt have time to be scared
2300306 it is absolutely clear that this was a long planned offensive by georgia against south ossetia not a spontaneous action
2300307 but the entry of russian forces into the conflict is a worst nightmare scenario georgian leaders may have thought they could achieve a quick fait accompli but now we are looking at the specter of a long conflict with much destruction and many victims
2300308 we call on all sides including georgians south ossetians and russians to bring tensions down to avoid bringing about a conflict
2300309 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia he said
2300310 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border
2300311 and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2300312 it is my duty as president of the russian federation to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they may be

2300355 it has affected it a little bit the cars are a little bit better on the curbs so it doesnt upset the car as much i like taking the gravel traps out one you dont pay the price when you get off the race track i got off the race track one time in the gravel trap and got gravel up in the shifter you know and couldnt shift anymore took some oil pump belts off and stuff like that so a lot of times you have to stop the race the paved run off area is very good for the racing very good for the fans and the sport and safety going into gravel at 150 you just never know whats going to happen getting off the track on to a pavement skid pad if you will is much safer so i like that with what the tracks done
2300356 the first thing is well put a windshield wiper on our car weve got one there and thats a big step but i thought it went really well the fans seemed to enjoy it they were as animated as ive ever seen fans even with their ponchos and umbrellas and all that everybody was really pumped i thought it was an interesting race it probably wont happen very often but i think when it does i thought nascar did a great job i thought the calls were right on they let us race when it was raceable and they shut it off and threw the red flag right when it was getting to the point of a little fear its tough so thats a great test and i think in the future we can run and do the same thing and be fine
2300357 i am very excited about running at nashville this weekend we had a successful test back in july and ive had several good runs in my late model at the music city motorplex across town hopefully some of that good karma will carry over to the speedway and i can bring home a guitar

2300431 yo solo vengo a aportar mi experiencia personal y a intercambiar impresiones sobre algunos casos concretos que viv a lo largo de mi dilatada carrera en el mbito policial que ya lleva m s de 29 a os
2300432 sin dudas que es muy importante contar con los elementos t cnicos de avanzada sobretodo lo que tiene que ver con la comunicaci n pero en muchos casos estos elementos suelen pasar a un segundo plano primando la capacidad y criterio del ser humano ya sea del negociador como del personal policial que se encuentran en el operativo porque muchas veces por m s que uno cuente con todos esos elementos t cnicos de ltima generaci n puede fallar en la manera de expresarse o de actuar apresuradamente y puede resultar fatal para cualquiera de las partes involucradas en la problem tica

2300441 y en mi opini n si la pol tica municipal en relaci n con el transporte es favorecer a los colectivos con problemas econ micos por raz n de la edad o porque se quiere fomentar el transporte p blico en vez del particular esa pol tica tiene que salir del ayuntamiento
2300442 esa la del ayuntamiento deber a ser la nica subvenci n a la empresa de transporte urbano eficiente que deber amos tener esa deber a ser la meta todo lo dem s me parecen cuentos de la lechera sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la situaci n econ mica de las otras administraciones p blicas por eso no entiendo c mo se puede estar pensando en otro tipo de acciones que no sean la de la eficiencia o la de la ampliaci n de capital para sanear la empresa y realizar nuevas inversiones
2300443 los pol ticos deber an incorporar a su lenguaje criterios empresariales porque las empresas que funcionan bien funcionan hasta en poca de crisis eso s las que tienen buenos gestores las que no se van al traste podemos imitar los criterios empresariales e incorporarlos a las empresas p blicas esa es mi pol tica

2300636 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 soundtrack not only suits the films divergent characters it also offers the perfect mood music for a summer drive
2300637 i think it just again shows the world how diverse oklahoma is not only in its people but in its music
2300638 i laughed at him the whole time we were writing it he gets up and gets possessed and walks around the room and acts this stuff out and its like hes onstage doing his act and its funny
2300639 its legitimate when you see me laugh at him in the movie im really laughing at him he could run those lines 100 times and his delivery would make me laugh
2300640 im standing there with tom skerritt and willie nelson and ted nugent and toby keith to me itd be equivalent to the beatles and some guy who works at quik trip i felt like how did i get here most of the time
2300641 i already had the story i had already written the story and submitted that and they mtv films loved it so now all i had to do was write this screenplay to go in and do all the dialogue and stuff
2300642 rodney created several really good scenes for the movie and then across the board just made the dialogue blow up and be funny
2300643 and rodney has a real sensitive side to him he was able to really help the scenes of like claire and my part when rack and annie get together he was real instrumental
2300644 toby was desperate toby needed somebody because his career was floundering
2300645 i came to his house his disneyland tobyworld that he lives at there in norman
2300646 but i drove over there spent three or four days at his house we wrote a 20 page outline
2300647 i thought that i could help toby with that aspect of it toby had a clear idea in his mind about what he wanted in this movie and i just helped him facilitate what he wanted
2300648 then i brought my own creativity as far as my many years of being on the road and telling jokes and being funny so it was a collaborative effort it was fun
2300649 the days were long they were 12 and 14 hour days but we had a blast i mean the laughing you see on the set is genuine
2300650 right it was my fault even though blake was in the back
2300651 which i already tried to say yesterday that it was my fault
2300652 we just have fun working together so i know in the first movie they kind of got out of our way and whatever we were lucky enough to have as chemistry ourselves they really let it come through
2300653 since this movie essentially kind of picked up where we left off there was more of that
2300654 i kind of didnt jump when i was supposed to but then i did eventually
2300655 this movie is about friendship and its about this special bond and so it would be about how friendships change throughout your lifetimes
2300656 and i always thought that this movie was not so much about what each of the girls were going through so much as how what theyre going through affects their bond
2300657 we got in a tiny little mo ped accident the very first day of shooting and actually blake really hurt her knee pretty bad and america fell off her bike and spun around
2300658 it was very dramatic and great for a first day of shooting
2300659 a few of us were on crutches for a while
2300660 but it was good because i got to make fun of them on crutches

2300706 we have robust procedures in place to detect system breaches and this is the first time that such an incident has occurred
2300707 the arrests of those individuals and their subsequent sentencing has shown that we will not tolerate a minority of people bringing misery to the lives of others

2300869 ive always worked for this but gymnastics isnt an exact science
2300870 i simply want to put everything together and not have any regrets its for this reason that i left paris to return to train in lyon with my coach who knows me perfectly

2300877 you must be kidding me this country really needs a new president this country is so messed up
2300878 its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become its ok for children to see people killed by guns spreading a little love right now would be a good idea
2300879 she is being a little sexy but they are not provocative
2300880 they are really well done the spot is really beautiful i really cant believe this is happening i dont know what else to say
2300881 this is the first time i have ever let anybody in my lingerie closet anybody with cameras
2300882 manchmal bin ich so geistreich dass ich nicht ein einziges wort von dem verstehe was ich sage
2300883 meu carro estava muito bom e aos poucos fui descobrindo detalhes do tra ado que me ajudaram a andar cada vez mais r pido
2300884 everyday tools can be beautiful too its about seeing the things we use everyday
2300885 make a choice to avoid the beige what does beige say its all about the choice choose color choose happy
2300886 this is creative thinking stop seeing things from my perspective start seeing them from his make my idea his idea
2300887 i write not so much fiction anymore but definitely trying to tell our stories im still looking for the best ways to put words together
2300888 documenting and creating photos and pretty paper and good stories its a passion with a purpose
2300889 if something is important shouldnt it look that way if something has value it deserves a little special treatment
2300890 my camera is as indispensible as underwear photos freeze a moment in time but they tell the story the way i choose to tell it freeze the moments well really remember most
2300891 its creative you have to think in new ways there is a beautiful outcome it makes my heart sing
2300892 my home is my biggest canvas every choice should say something about us does your house introduce itself or you
2300893 creativity is a lifestyle not a hobby these are a few things i do to lead a creative life its not just paint or paper its in the way we see
2300894 hey youre being stupid if there are eleven things to be happy about just be happy about all of them
2300895 oh dear i dont know why it looks like that
2300896 oh boy jessica sprague just bought a macbook my computer hero has officially made the switch
2300897 you are too funny so does that mean were picking one up this weekend
2300898 develop a slate of sophisticated and uplifting romantic comedies and dramas
2300899 a prep school teacher who self imposes a deadline to get over his girlfriend who haunts his every move three years after their breakup
2300900 all that other stuff associated with him floats away and you just get to enjoy that kid we met such a long time ago
2300901 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2300902 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2300903 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2300904 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2300905 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2300906 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2300907 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2300908 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2300909 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2300910 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2300911 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2300912 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2300913 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2300914 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2300915 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2300916 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2300917 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2300918 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2300919 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2300920 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2300921 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2300922 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2300923 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2300924 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2300925 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2300926 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2300927 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2300928 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2300929 who are open to doing something on the production side
2300930 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2300931 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2300932 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2300933 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2300934 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2300935 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2300936 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2300937 she has a right cerebral traumatic lesion according to the report she has a slurred left side left side weakness insomnia and memory impairment
2300938 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2300939 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2300940 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2300941 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2300942 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2300943 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2300944 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2300945 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2300946 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2300947 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2300948 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2300949 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2300950 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2300951 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2300952 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2300953 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2300954 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2300955 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2300956 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2300957 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2300958 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2300959 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2300960 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2300961 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2300962 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2300963 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2300964 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2300965 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2300966 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2300967 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2300968 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2300969 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2300970 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2300971 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2300972 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2300973 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2300974 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2300975 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2300976 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2300977 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2300978 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2300979 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2300980 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2300981 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2300982 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2300983 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2300984 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2300985 when we wanted to do an industrial song we did it and when we were into writing a ballad thats what we did
2300986 fue una se al clara que todos los bonos deb an bajar de precio para acompa ar esa suba en el rendimiento de la deuda argentina
2300987 a incapacidade do governo italiano de garantir o direito de express o em territ rio italiano a um chefe de estado estrangeiro
2300988 i learned that trials are about credibility and that if a jury is to believe your case a jury must believe you
2300989 that one other characteristic that you have above all the other democrats that you say im in this race because they don
2300990 if i were choosing a president and i wasnt running
2300991 besides the policy positions which are important i would be looking absolutely require that the person i vote for be honest and sincere we dont need the worlds next great politician as president we need somebody we can trust
2300992 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2300993 decisions in washington have to be weighted toward american workers american companies and the general prosperity of america
2300994 somethings wrong when special interests run ahead of the personal interests of america
2300995 when it comes to our trade negotiations right now we have a trade deficit with china
2300996 they dump about 320 billion dollars worth of goods which is five times greater than our exports to china while at the same time they are not acting fairly with respect to some of the products that we sell to them
2300997 we dont want to have a race to the bottom
2300998 we want to bring these other countries up to the standards that we require
2300999 if they want to do business with the greatest economy in the world then they have to get on board with us
2301000 thats what ohio has to do and america has to do we have to stop the bleeding
2301001 that is a huge decision that we have to make as a country because were going to get resistance and pushback from these other countries
2301002 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio
2301003 vaadates viimast s ndmuste arengut on peamine see et konflikt v givaldsel moel ei j tkuks
2301004 its shameful horrible thing for him to do to use us to promote him
2301005 to the extent that anybody intervened on behalf of a special interest that was senator stevens it certainly wasnt senator mccain
2301006 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio
2301007 you cant come with flowers or you can but the idea is bizarre
2301008 the speech by al gore climate change and sustainability rel the post below
2301009 its not about georgia any more its about america its values
2301010 it boils down to kosovo independence natos bucharest summit and possibly russian internal politics and the transfer of power
2301011 the worst crisis in europe since the end of communism
2301012 i just want to go out there and execute whatever we are in
2301013 any time you step between those lines you want to be at your best so any time i step on the field whether its practice a walk through whatever im trying to be perfect
2301014 i think you want to continue to see the progression and if that progression ever stops and its not where you want it to be then thats when you would make a decision
2301015 but right now everything weve asked him to do hes done improvements that weve asked him to make hes made
2301016 theres been more good than bad but i just have to be more consistent ive felt like this year more than last year i can have a bad play and continue to have a good practice after that in the past if i had a bad play id continue to have a downslide in practice i had a bad play here and there and i feel like after that bad play i pretty much move on
2301017 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2301018 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2301019 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2301020 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2301021 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2301022 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2301023 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2301024 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2301025 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that

2301027 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2301028 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation

2301066 right now its the same for everybody on the cup side as nobody has gotten on the track so hopefully well be able to work on our cars tomorrow and make them better
2301067 obviously having a good starting position really helps in being able to get up front i kind of struggled with qualifying at sonoma and we ended up 30th here this weekend starting up front should pay dividends hopefully we can have a fast enough race car to keep it up there and lead it out until the end
2301068 despite all the problems weve had i didnt want to jump ship when its sinking or when people think its sinking
2301069 to be honest it wasnt just one team that contacted me
2301070 there has been this big buzz about one guy but if people had looked around there were more people who tried to contact me
2301071 there were a few contacts which made me feel flattered i never had my mind made up to go elsewhere until i had closed out all the options at agr
2301072 i talked to him on wednesday night and he said we were fine we were great and were a go
2301073 then i get a call from his agent who says tony has flipped and hes staying with agr he said something about tony not liking one of the clauses in the contract but i didnt change anything
2301074 i didnt want it to influence my deal until i couldnt reach an agreement with agr i was not going to listen to anybody else
2301075 first of all i appreciate the respect they have for me second of all i had a handshake which means a lot to me i knew these guys were committed thats why i disappeared for three days to concentrate on it
2301076 there were a couple of things that i had doubts about
2301077 i had to ask before i signed it wasnt a case of if you dont do that im not going to sign it was more a case of can we do this or can we do that it was the formality of it
2301078 it was nice to get that finished and put an end to all the rumors
2301079 tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family there was never any question that tony was going to be with us for a long long time
2301080 it was more about minor things that had to be addressed i wanted them in a different way there were two clauses one was their way the other was mine then the deal was done
2301081 your regular fix of commodore 64 tunes remixes news and whatever takes our fancy
2301082 very much so i mean very i mean its been a long time coming
2301083 just couldnt stay away from being here to meet mr mccain we support him and are real excited about it
2301084 those numbers may be more of a shock to people in oregon and the obama campaign but im happy oregon is a real competitive state
2301085 the state of oregon has had a history of being closer than either california or washington
2301086 we have always anticipated working hard in oregon all the way through november which is why we have staff on the ground and offices open across the state
2301087 the ordinary voter is going to say ok do i want someone breaking into my car or stealing my car or stealing my identity no i dont and i want government to put these predators behind bars and pull them off the streets
2301088 we know oregonians have not gotten enough information about mccains social security policy
2301089 there are 643 000 oregonians relying on social security right now and under mccains privatization policy 105 000 of them would be cast into poverty
2301090 we are not taking anything for granted we are going to be out there getting every single vote
2301091 weve got people out on the street canvassing and knocking on doors the more people that participate in this process the better off this country is
2301092 its been around since the 1930s but republicans have been chipping away at it

2301120 i suddenly realized that the devout russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven on earth the were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer and for which it was a glory to die
2301121 for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
2301122 the end of all things is near therefore be clear minded and self controlled so that you can pray above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins
2301123 he has been out for a year and is not quite ready to start in our team just now

2301131 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2301132 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2301133 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2301134 impact influence what possible way is there to gauge the influence and impact of rabbis who quietly and without fanfare teach torah every day of any week in any synagogue
2301135 newsweek coms list of top rabbis should not only cause concern for rabbis it should cause concern for lay leaders as well the making of a jew is a slow and laborious task and most of the work happens out of anyones range of sight
2301136 and so to my colleagues who are peeved that they didnt make the list despite their contacts and to those jews in the pews who are miffed that their rabbis names somehow got left on the cutting room floor do not despair like the afikomen at the seder the real goodness that happens is often hidden its just waiting for someone to find it
2301137 willing to compromise on the status of jerusalem as a united city under israeli jurisdiction
2301138 a remarkable gap between the attitudes of american jews and the conventional wisdom about how jews view americas role in the middle east
2301139 playing an active role in helping the parties to resolve the arab israeli conflict even if it meant the united states publicly stating its disagreements with both the israelis and the arabs
2301140 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
2301141 when asked which technology they would be most willing to give up
2301142 39 4 percent of internet users choose their cell phone followed by 32 7 percent who would first give up television only 27 8 percent of users say they would be most willing to give up the internet
2301143 online world as important to internet users as real world
2301144 were now trying to put together a network of blogs for the church and the various ministries in it im finding that they are a tool that is ideal for the kind of things our congregation needs to do
2301145 people who use the internet to shop for a church home will likely be turned off by a poorly produced church web site while a slick interactive site could help draw new members in if a church invests the right resources
2301146 i had no presuppositions about how synagogues work i think if id been an insider my presuppositions would have clouded the work
2301147 do you think that those contribute to some kind of dysfunction particularly the lack of participation
2301148 rocking the church membership boat counting members or having member who count
2301149 i will shop around and see what each is like and pick the one that gives me the best bang for my buck

2301169 before returning to your car you may want to check out the contemporary crafts gallery at 3934 sw corbett two blocks north of lowell it was founded in 1937 by a group of women whose mission was to foster an appreciation for fine craftsmanship while providing a market for artists the atmosphere is mellow and the art and crafts in both permanent and changing exhibits are superb most items except in the permanent exhibits are for sale

2301173 the eu should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a euro atlantic area of cooperation with the united states in the field of freedom security and justice
2301174 a country that in privacy terms is all but lawless us privacy laws are weak they offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non citizens
2301175 relevant security related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states
2301176 by 2014 the european union should make up its mind with regard to
2301177 an e border concept on the basis of current reflections by the commission should be established
2301178 the aim of this idea is to bring member states closer not only by means of standardisation when necessary but also by operational means
2301179 as is well known the entire area of security technology has undergone major developments in the past few years efforts must be made to standardise new materials in order to obtain better interoperability especially in the areas of video surveillance internet telephony and police use of unpiloted aircraft sharing certain state of the art materials requiring large investments should be considered when they do not need to be in continuous use it appears that this sector cannot be managed politically by individual member states or industrially only by the companies working in this field
2301180 the convergence principle is a very big step forward to a european state they want to standardise eu policing as well as working much closely on an operational level
2301181 they keep saying the public want security actually the public wants safety public safety should not always be defined as security security is the ideology of the state

2301188 my most important insight is that there are two different sources of learning learning from the experience of the past and learning from the future as it emerges

2301201 so the measurements we made combined with other measurements we are analyzing will help us predict we hope the arrival of solar flares or explosions of light energy from the sun which could disrupt communications
2301202 there are 200 billion dollars of satellites circling the earth all the time and all of these are vulnerable you depend on them we depend on them and if we can get a better understanding on how the sun affects those and be able to predict how the sun affects those then we can save people a lot of money and irritation when networks go down
2301203 its been an interesting experience for me mainly to work with the physics department here at purdue again after a little bit of a break

2301213 when i got tired of going out and getting in fistfights on weekends i started hanging out with a couple of guys who played music
2301214 it was a mind changing and mind altering experience and it wasnt the lsd
2301215 there were no rock stars in those days there were just bands i had an instrument but i had never thought about buckling down and making it a profession but when i went there i was just so blown away by that environment
2301216 looking back now it was only about 3 000 people but it felt like 100 000 all cool people everybody getting high and everybody on the same page
2301217 as soon as i got a car i thought i aint gonna drive down to a damn gym

2301219 when i got tired of going out and getting in fistfights on weekends i started hanging out with a couple of guys who played music

2301245 the tremendous downtown changes have given the residents a renewed sense of confidence and optimism about the future of the city
2301246 externally its really helped us to reset the image of kansas city
2301247 in order for us to go downtown and bring jobs into downtown we wanted cordish to push along with their plan under a specific timeframe
2301248 we wanted an area that would attract the kind of employees h amp r is looking for
2301249 people are back downtown with their pets with their bikes and vespas

2301253 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2301254 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2301255 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2301256 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2301257 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2301258 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2301259 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2301260 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2301261 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2301262 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2301263 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2301266 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
2301267 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

2301283 they were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel
2301284 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence

2301289 seek the lord all you humble of the earth who have carried out his ordinances seek righteousness seek humility perhaps you will be hidden in the day of the lords anger
2301290 for i testify about them that they have a zeal for god but not in accordance with knowledge for not knowing about gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of god
2301291 you are of your father the devil and you want to do the desires of your father he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him whenever he speaks a lie he speaks from his own nature for he is a liar and the father of lies

2301307 no va directo a cu les son los elementos que seg n algunos actores pudieran ser inconstitucionales y yo creo que ah la misma constituci n nos ha dado las herramientas para si no estamos de acuerdo hacer el planteamiento
2301308 primero el tsj en cuanto a la constitucionalidad o no de algunas de las leyes que est n ah y otro si alguien piensa que una ley en su totalidad es inconstitucional y que de alguna forma afecta principios que no deben ser afectados la constituci n previ el mecanismo del referendo abrogatorio

2301311 art culo 10 podr n postularse como candidatas o candidatos a alcaldesa o alcalde de un municipio que conforma un rea metropolitana las alcaldesas o alcalde que hubiesen sido reelegidos en otro de los municipios que conforman dicha rea metropolitana en estos casos la alcaldesa o alcalde deber separarse del ejercicio del cargo antes de su postulaci n
2301312 para ser alcalde o alcaldesa se requiere ser venezolano o venezolana mayor de veinticinco a os y de estado seglar el alcalde o alcaldesa ser elegido o elegida por un per odo de cuatro a os por mayor as de las personas que votan y podr ser reelegido o reelegida de inmediato y por una sola vez para un nuevo per odo
2301313 cabe preguntarse si es posible que una persona que haya sido alcalde o alcaldesa de un municipio que conforma un rea metropolitana pueda optar al mismo cargo en otro municipio que conforma dicha rea metropolitana a n cuando no haya residido en l y venga de cumplir el per odo constitucional como consecuencia de su reelecci n
2301314 la respuesta por supuesto corresponde al an lisis de fondo que debe hacer esta sala electoral en la sentencia definitiva sin embargo y sin que ello signifique prejuzgar sobre el m rito del asunto este rgano judicial estima prima facie que una persona que venga de cumplir su mandato constitucional como alcalde o alcaldesa reelecto no podr a optar como candidato al mismo cargo en otro municipio donde no ha residido en raz n de que ello podr an traducirse en un menoscabo del criterio objetivo de vinculaci n espacial entre electores y elegido que tiende a establecer una mayor conexi n con aspectos propios de la vida local y un conocimiento mayor acerca de la idoneidad de las pol ticas p blicas que el candidato que aspire optar al cargo de alcalde o alcaldesa debe implementar en su programa de gobierno
2301315 constituye en apariencia una amenaza de violaci n al orden constitucional al establecer la posibilidad de postulaci n como candidatos al cargo de alcalde o alcaldesa de un municipio donde no han residido a personas que ya han ocupado ese mismo cargo en otros municipios que conformen el rea metropolitana luego de haber cumplido su mandato constitucional en el anterior por consiguiente la pretensi n de amparo cautelar resulta procedente

2301395 ruth concludes with a genealogy which seems anticlimactic for the narrative to end however closer inspection shows how it fits the context by tracing perez through boaz and on to david the narrator shows that the prayers of blessing offered earlier in the chapter were fulfilled god made boaz famous and gave him an unbroken line of male descendants culminating in david this reminds us god does bless the faithful even after their lifetime and more than they can imagine

2301400 yeah i think reiko beats us all im thankful for friends who are sad to see me leave our church yet dont set me at an emotional arms length during the process of leaving im thankful that our house took eighteen months to sell so many friends at church got to see my daughter born and enjoy her first year

2301403 unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
2301404 how can a man be born when he is old
2301405 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god
2301406 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2301407 whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2301408 dont drink or smoke or chew and dont go with girls who do
2301409 there are way too many choices and distractions in our lives technology keeps us from talking to each other and busy schedules mean we rarely eat together unless its in the car
2301410 i feel gen x parents are constantly comparing ourselves and our children with our friends and their offspring not in a keeping up with the joneses kind of way but because were insecure about the job were doing as parents i find myself constantly questioning am i providing enough intellectual stimulation for my child is my daughter getting enough socialization should she have reached x y or z milestone by now basically am i really doing a good job and exactly what does a good job of parenting look like
2301411 but he who is greatest among you shall be your servant and whoever exalts himself will be abased and he who humbles himself will be exalted

2301416 so when he jesus heard that he lazarus was sick he stayed two more days in the place where he was

2301418 from that day on they plotted to put him to death
2301419 everyone will believe in him and the romans will come and take away both our place and nation
2301420 he came to his own and his own did not receive him
2301421 a disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
2301422 enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in by it because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life and there are few who find it
2301423 whoever desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever desires to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul for whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him the son of man also will be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
2301424 he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose
2301425 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost whether he has enough to finish it lest after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish all who see it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is still a great way off he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace so likewise whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple
2301426 they cant use their house as an atm and theyre building up credit card debt

2301439 my youngest was graduating i had heavy deadlines there were normal family crises and upheavals i had a list of thirty four things to do now during all this i was writing a manuscript and managed to turn it in on time on june 1 when i received the editors initial review of the book she commented on the anger and bitterness of the wife character the total unlikeability of the husband character and the general in your face negativity of the book i was shocked that the emotions of the spring were so blatantly revealed in the work it was a wake up call to me as a writer i had to completely rewrite the book
2301440 these were largely nomadic people and only put essentials in their burden basket as they had to carry everything with them a tumpline of leather around their foreheads kept the baskets shaped like whirlwinds in the center of their backs but it was also important that the contents of the basket be balanced so unnatural pressure wasnt placed on one side of the neck and head
2301441 its been my experience that women often put more than the essentials in the things they carry around with them old hurts disappointments anxiety guilt all get carried leaving little room for the real essentials like love of god family and friends in addition they stuff their worries into the bottom of the basket where they are hard to reach and consequently hard to deal with
2301442 do you have gayle ropers latest book ive been waiting for it and its finally out

2301446 we wont have the difficulties i had with my mom the tensions and fights and demands with the help of the lord well avoid them my son will always know i love him and am there for him
2301447 i relentlessly pursue all things that are important to me including god family friends ministry and rest in other words i dont give up on what matters to me
2301448 these relentless pursuits fuel me to continue running the race
2301449 besides wanting to be a movie star i wanted to write a novel although the idea never completely left i thought it was just an unattainable dream
2301450 two years after i retired being a novelist rose in my thoughts again a year later i sold my first of several books i realized that dreams can come true but its not our timing that counts dreams happen in gods time if we put our trust in him and respond to his leading
2301451 while dreams are nice and they get us up in the morning
2301452 obedience to god is far more important than marching toward some distant dream that may or may not be part of his plan for us
2301453 i have a catch phrase i use for christian romance chaste but promising christian romance need lack nothing in emotional impact in fact the restraint on the part of the characters can heighten the tension in spite of the strong physical and emotional pull of genuine affection the characters choose to remain chaste because they believe this is right this is what god asks of them
2301454 what ive done in all of these stories is play off of something already written first melvilles character and then my own
2301455 the article didnt have nearly enough information but once i started researching i found so much that i wondered why id never heard of it before i even found online diaries kept by people who trained with seizure alert dogs which provided exactly the sort of information i needed and sparked so many ideas for my characters that i couldnt keep up with them an initial tidbit plus a lot of research can add up to a winning plot
2301456 i always begin with setting which gives me the type of people characters who would live there which gives me what they would be doing in that area and what challenges theyd be facing and that leads me to their conflicts and then i have a story
2301457 ive gotten several ideas singing in church my in the garden series came to me while we were singing that song
2301458 plots usually come first in the form of a niggling thought chewing on my poor overworked brain
2301459 an idea came to me one day as i was walking against a very stiff wind it was a difficult time in my life and the wind seemed to symbolize my struggle the thought expanded to the christian walk but instead of symbolizing the struggle it spoke of the never changing one who has walked the hard road ahead of us and triumphed the novel was my very first sale yesterday today and forever published in 1989 i believe all creativity originates from him
2301460 how likely is it that you would recommend your home builder or remodeler to family or friends
2301461 dat vind ik een vreselijke vraag een rare vraag een gecompliceerde vraag daar ga ik geen antwoord op geven ik bedoel ik ben twintig hoe kan ik in de korte tijd die we hebben de twintig jaar van mijn leven op tafel uitstallen
2301462 okee goed een andere vraag dus heb je eerdere relaties gehad
2301463 ben jij wel normaal is dit je eerste keer ofzo
2301464 vier als ik goed tel waarom wil je dat weten
2301465 doe eens normaal heb je geen opvoeding gehad je ziet er ongelofelijk onaantrekkelijk uit met je uitgerekte afgedragen nike trui dat vette haar vol klitten je dubbele onderkin met een harige moedervlek dat lijkt op een overreden doodgebloed roodborstje op een gelatine pudding afgezien daarvan stel je ook nog eens onbeschaafde vragen je maakt je geslacht ten schande
2301466 kosovo is not better than us we deserve independence even before kosovo and we ask for the backing of the united states and the european union for our independence
2301467 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs

2301470 people say they want to be green but they dont want to compromise
2301471 we dont really know yet what it means to be green in the hospitality field
2301472 said they would suffer discomfort because they would get back to their room and it would be extremely hot
2301473 indicated that entering a dark room could be a safety issue
2301474 why run the risk of losing a customer because a room needs a few minutes to cool while the air conditioning kicks in its better business just to run the a c and make sure the client comes back
2301475 north america just doesnt have the culture of saving resources
2301476 we wanted to do it in a more stylish way
2301477 the world has shifted if you do the right thing people pick up on it
2301478 strengthening our nations energy security and supporting american farming communities
2301479 the food inflation that youve seen now at least in the meat and poultry sector probably is mild compared to what may be coming in the future
2301480 there is an understanding between and among health professionals that the environment is playing a really important part in our health status
2301481 there are major parts of the building that never shut down
2301482 we have to have a certain airflow have to stay at a certain temperature so there are unique things that make cutting energy use more complicated
2301483 is leaching into the environment and were ingesting some of that through fish and seafood
2301484 agave can bring in the new era of bio economics giving the world enough clean energy for a peaceful and secure world
2301485 high quality agaves are very good feedstock material for biofuel for the following characteristics high total sugar density and content high weight of the fruit and stems cultivation and harvest cycles of six years high density of plants per hectare genetic diversity and high adaptability low water requirements co2 and capture methane metabolism soil retention plant nutrition products from inulin and low maintenance during cultivation
2301486 agave is the ideal feedstock for an integrated biorefinery where biofuels bioenergy and high profit bioproducts are derived with a zero waste platform
2301487 agave can bring in the new era of bio economics giving the world enough clean energy for a peaceful and secure world
2301488 our enhanced agave tequilana weber variety plants have a sugar content of 27 to 38 brix which is 3 times sugarcanes and weigh around 300 kilos 660 pounds each individual but weve got plants from another agave species that weigh 1 2 metric tons each with sugar content around 25 brix double that of sugar cane this means that annually per acre we could easily get 5 000 gallons of distilled ethanol and fifty metric tons of dry biomass with 33 metric tons of cellulose content
2301489 the technology for producing massive amounts of our enhanced agave variety uniform in sugar content size weight and harvesting time is ready this allows mechanization in the field from establishment to harvesting reducing costs time and labor which in time allows the establishment of very large plantations of agave that is in the millions of hectares
2301490 agave thrives in semi arid wastelands 50 of mexico needs no watering or agrochemicals requires very scarce field labor and grows well in any type of soil even highly degraded and steep terrains because it takes nitrogen from the air one third of the worlds habitable land is arid and semi arid where agave can be cultivated some agave species accept temperature ranges from 14 c to 50 c
2301491 the use of products derived from agaves goes back to pre hispanic cultures
2301492 in the present it is common to find examples of these products in mexico in traditional beverages like tequila mescal and pulque in traditional mexican cuisine arts and crafts and rope and fibers among others agave is a class of plants familiar and part of the national culture a project or program successful in producing biofuel in addition to these would only be a gainful extension of uses already existing
2301493 prospectively we plan with the agro industry to employ agave varieties which requires first of all to continue characterization and selection establishment of an in vitro germ plasm bank for the preservation protection and conservation of original examples of the best of varieties in order to increase the number registered in the national catalog and preserving the rights of ownership and have them available in the genetic and phytosanitary registry for rapid propagation and use by the agro industry this requires the support of government agencies such as ine or others to which this program applies
2301494 i claim that theres no other plant or tree in the world that can produce as much sugar and cellulose cellulose is the organic oil substitute green oil and sugar can be converted into many things agave sugars can be even eaten by diabetics without any risk and have a high probiotic value
2301495 if you make paper or notebooks with that pulp youll get several times more money so the trick is to sell only the lignin biomass and use the cellulose for something else theres a type of cellulose called alpha cellulose with it you can even make food for human consumption its very expensive
2301496 vote republican or the hackers will get your credit card number
2301497 the coalition government has announced its objectives and explained its strategy
2301498 all four provinces will adopt resolutions requesting the federal government to ask president musharraf to get a vote of confidence a similar resolution will later be passed in the national assembly and the senate in case the president fails to win the vote the national assembly and the senate should impeach him
2301499 those voting against musharraf will have no fear of disqualification so there is no question of protecting anyone
2301500 those who believe that the issue is being put off lack political understanding
2301501 musharraf has to go now no matter what steps he take

2301505 i think what theyre doing is theyre trying to capitalize on the buildup to the games
2301506 and the apparent opportunity tip believes the olympic games presents in terms of targeting and striking a blow to china that the threat is credible and should be taken seriously
2301507 is indicative of an orchestrated campaign designed to fulfill jihadists belief that they should provide warning before launching a significant attack
2301508 the kashgar government at all levels has taken a series of measures to prevent and strike down any trouble

2301527 were tapping a market of people who want beautiful affordable homes that support their commitment to a truly sustainable lifestyle people want more than a solar panel here or an energy efficient appliance there they want their homes to play a key role in minimizing their carbon footprints and geos neighborhood does just that

2301599 states without saltwater licenses have a strong incentive to adopt licenses
2301600 any fee that a state collects through a license can be used for restoration and fishery management in the state by law the registry fee taken by noaa will offset the cost of issuing the registration it can not be specifically directed to fisheries management

2301661 i hope people will take a fresh look at china
2301662 it is very heavy snowflakes but before that it was quite flaky
2301663 primeras im genes de los gimnastas espa oles en los entrenamientos oficiales
2301664 from what we can gather they mean pretty well the same as us
2301665 a woman or perhaps sometimes a man who can do magic spells
2301666 its probably an important part of their religion if they call it magic and we call it science it doesnt really matter in the long run
2301667 i understood they were quite clear about the difference between magic and science
2301668 they were very interested in what sam had to say to them about science and technology but they obviously didnt think she was a witch
2301669 they asked that we bring some of our witches with us next time
2301670 didnt you tell them we dont have witches on earth
2301671 oh we tried thats when things started to go wrong
2301672 it seems theyve heard of the tauri and what theyve heard is that the tauri have the strongest witches since wed already introduced ourselves as tauri were automatically meant to have witches of our own if we dont turn up with some of our witches on our next visit we might as well not turn up at all
2301673 do you mean theyve had other visitors through their stargate
2301674 i dont think theyve tried to use it themselves for a long time maybe centuries they seem to be suspicious of it
2301675 from what you say they seem to be a long way behind us with their technology and trust seems to be an issue between us
2301676 from what they said they know about the goauld they seem to have freed themselves from the goauld a long time ago
2301677 do you have any idea of the sort of things they can do or at least what the kallistians think they can do
2301678 but they were all away probably dancing around a tree or something
2301679 they told us their witches were busy with a problem
2301680 but they wouldnt explain what it was they want to talk to our witches about it
2301681 whilst we dont have witches as such we do know that some people are reputed to have special abilities such as esp precognition and so on ill make some inquiries i know there have been a few special projects over the years it may be well be able to come up with some special ability people who qualify under the kallistien definition of witch
2301682 you mean people who can tell apples from oranges on cards in separate rooms that sort of thing
2301683 would these special ability people be the sort of people you would trust with the secret of the stargate
2301684 if they are to visit kallistien they will need to be trusted with this information
2301685 first lets see if we can come up with anybody then well see if we want to trust them
2301686 i cant work in these conditions with so much scepticism about
2301687 but i agree with you weve been wasting our time
2301688 lets deal without a name for the moment major carter
2301689 but if i did that you wouldnt have the witches to help you with the little metal monsters
2301690 not technically but i have been known to do a little magic
2301691 i have the sight and i know youll be facing them again very soon
2301692 we need to know how you found out about all this we need to know just who you are and what you know
2301693 but this will all become clear to you before very much longer
2301694 she walked right past this mirror but she had no reflection
2301695 maybe she was some sort of a projection that would explain the disappearance as well
2301696 the door stays shut weve got to gain time for the self destruct to work
2301697 i hope we dont have to interview any more so called witches or rather any more idiots like the last lot
2301698 theres never a bad day that cant get any worse
2301699 whatever side youre on count me as part of the opposition
2301700 colonel maybourne says he can help us with our search for special ability people
2301701 the words out you want witches we can help with that
2301702 do they come with their own pointy hats and broomsticks
2301703 you know as well as i do there are people out there who think of themselves as witches we dont have any of them actually working for us of course but we do have records of a few and they may be what youre looking for
2301704 were not simply looking for people who think theyre witches
2301705 we have a need for a few people with special abilities who may be thought of as witches by some people were dealing with
2301706 colonel if youve come here to hand out insults you can leave now
2301707 that was uncalled for of course but i think we might be able to help you the nid has access to some classified files from a number of old projects as well as a wide variety of information sources we have a group of witches on the way here and we believe that they dont just think of themselves as witches but they have special abilities as well
2301708 the information weve got is incomplete it comes from various sources and none of them spell out what these people can do no pun intended
2301709 anybody who can turn maybourne into a toad gets the job
2301710 if any of them turn out to be what you want you can check them out yourself as for why were helping well thats just it we want to help we want to be part of the stargate programme
2301711 but no pressure thats up to you when it comes down to it we all work for the same boss weve been told to help and were helping
2301712 this is harry maybourne on the day he was born he was up to something
2301713 but lets see who he comes up with first well make a decision about whether theyre suitable when weve seen them and checked them out itll certainly look better if we say somebodys unsuitable after weve seen them rather than rejecting them just because they come from the nid
2301714 even if we find out how they got rid of the goauld it may not be anything we can use it was probably no more than some sort of uprising that took the local goauld by surprise
2301715 she said we will need help from witches to deal with the replicators
2301716 it wouldnt surprise me to find out shes another part of maybournes scam
2301717 i bet he knows about the replicators the jump out of the window must have been set up in some way to make her seem mysterious
2301718 or maybe a trick mirror i dont know but i do know theres a perfectly reasonable explanation for everything we saw
2301719 i thought even idiot vampires like you knew better than to try to feed in the slayers town
2301720 why didnt you want me in on the interrogation of the vamp
2301721 i know a few ways to make one of them talk
2301722 anyway i didnt want you to get to know him know him as a person its easier to stake an anonymous vampire it becomes more difficult once you start to know the person he used to be
2301723 wouldnt have made a difference to me ive never had any trouble staking vamps
2301724 but i dont want to take any chances ive seen it happen once you get to know somebody however evil theyve been or still are you start making excuses to yourself about why you shouldnt stake them yet
2301725 we need to give all this information about vampire activity in la to cordy and angel
2301726 couldnt you give him a soul like you did for angel darla and drusilla
2301727 theres only a limited supply of orbs of thesulah so i need to keep the ones i have for special occasions
2301728 vampires with souls can still feed and some of them would weve been lucky so far with the souled vampires but it would be very risky to overdo it
2301729 i couldnt understand half of what that guy stevens was saying most of the time
2301730 i think they all talk like that where he comes from i dont think even giles understood him when he really got excited
2301731 giles would have been happier if hed been talking in ancient greek or sumerian or something like that
2301732 but who is he if he wants to talk to us he can explain himself didnt your mother tell you not to go off with strange men
2301733 just what are you up to what do you want
2301734 i im eric saward i work for homeland security we need
2301735 we dont have the time give me a card and ill be in touch
2301736 ill wait for you here ive got a few calls to make anyway
2301737 i got the other two but there may be more on the way our uh transport will be here in a minute
2301738 if youre really homeland security youll know where to find me
2301739 i thought you were going to pick up buffy and faith
2301740 but they werent there i need to speak to willow and kennedy
2301741 because i keyed into the amulets they wear like i usually do but when i orbed in they were gone and they werent nearby they went somewhere suddenly but i dont know where i cant locate them now
2301742 i checked and nobody else was in the area anyway i think id have known if there were any other whitelighters nearby and i should still be able to locate them
2301743 i simply dont know i hope not whatever happened it happened very quickly i know they were there just before i arrived
2301744 they were just unconscious so i left them that way i uh went through their pockets
2301745 there were guns lying on the floor but i left them alone
2301746 thats a branch of national security if i remember right
2301747 this is phoebe were talking about shes probably got a date
2301748 its just that i wanted to talk to her about leos party next week
2301749 ill make sure she doesnt forget to get him a present this time
2301750 the big guy in black and the blonde on his arm
2301751 he thought hed be able to find somebody tasty to eat in a place like this
2301752 ive been trying to get him to go outside with me for the past ten minutes
2301753 shes always had it even before she became a vampire its a little clearer now shes not insane anymore but it usually only gives her a little bit of the picture
2301754 it usually works that way for phoebe as well its as if the guys in charge up there dont want to make it too easy for us
2301755 hopefully shell get around to telling us how were involved
2301756 dru says you have to turn them to dust otherwise youre just wasting your time she says you guys will hear more about all this tomorrow when phoebe contacts you so be ready to move at a moments notice
2301757 at least shell be with you when you fight these things
2301758 a military plane shes asleep but shes ok i couldnt pick her up without revealing myself and things didnt look desperate enough for me to risk that
2301759 but i dont think we should just sit here doing nothing
2301760 we should be able to use our magic to find out exactly where that stargate portal is
2301761 thats where the big military base at cheyenne mountain is i bet thats where theyve got this portal theyll have maximum security on something like that theyll have it way down in the lower levels
2301762 why should i trust anybody who has worked forwolfram and hart
2301763 im just asking for protection for a chance to change sides i dont expect you to tell me all your deep dark secrets
2301764 so this isnt yet another plot by wolfram and hart
2301765 well im in trouble and its all your fault or at least the fault of your friends
2301766 i presume you were briefed all about it all about faith forcing it on me
2301767 you can get one of your witch friends to check it out later its because of the amulet that ive been able to break with wolfram and hart thats why im in trouble if i didnt have this amulet id still be happily under their control as it is ive got back my free will
2301768 why dont you go back to your previous life i presume you had one
2301769 if you really think somebody would be allowed to just walk away from wolfram and hart think again
2301770 the only way i have any chance away from them is with you people send me away and youre sending me to my death or worse believe me ive seen it happen
2301771 well you made the decision to work for them in the first place
2301772 i dont think i had any choice in the matter anyway theres another reason why you should help me
2301773 did wolfram and hart really think an attack like that would succeed no magic users no demons just a group of soldier boys i almost feel insulted
2301774 maybe it was some underling who doesnt know us very well
2301775 or maybe its meant to lull us into a false of security before the real attack
2301776 or maybe its a trick to make us think they want eve back when all theyre really doing is trying to make us trust her
2301777 its an old trick try very hard but not too hard to get somebody back when really you want them to stay right where they are
2301778 thats exactly what that was a trick to try to get you to trust me i worked it out with lilah the plan was for me to defect to you and for wolfram and hart to try to get me back but fail this puts me in deeper with you guys on the grounds that you have to keep me around to protect me
2301779 im double crossing lilah and wolfram and hart i only pretended to go along with them its how ive stayed alive since i got the amulet if id simply walked out id be dead by now if i was very lucky as it was i think i made them suspicious by going awol for a few days after i got the amulet thats why ive waited all this time before coming to you
2301780 why didnt you tell us all this before the attack
2301781 if you couldnt cope with an attack like that youre not the people to help me
2301782 i dont see wolfram and hart being happy for you to keep working for them while you have that
2301783 but lilah wants to keep hers so she hasnt told anybody else about them
2301784 and why exactly does lilah want you on the inside with us
2301785 take your pick she wants to know what you know she wants to be able to stop you doing anything she doesnt like she wants to feed you false information if shes got something more specific in mind she didnt tell me need to know and all that at this stage she just wants somebody near to you she can take advantage sometime in the future
2301786 if cordy were here she could do a truth spell
2301787 if you know somebodys going to do one on you all a truth spell can do is confirm you believe what you say at the time im sure wolfram and hart would have made preparations to get round any truth spell we use she could be primed to temporarily forget certain things
2301788 have you checked out what she said about being a slayer wes
2301789 but i think she was probably a potential when she was younger the trouble is a lot of records were destroyed when the old council was blown up i think wolfram and hart may have found a way to activate her and thats why she was able to go toe to toe with faith
2301790 id like to send her somewhere shell be safe but where she cant betray us if thats what she wants to do
2301791 and whats to stop us calling the police as soon as we get the chance
2301792 weve been drugged and abducted wheres the misunderstanding we dont have to put up with this
2301793 i think the term witches is whats caused the confusion here
2301794 for some reason the people instructed to contact you thought you were some sort of a threat thats very wrong we simply need your help if youre not able to help us or you dont want to help your country well supply transport to take you home
2301795 i bet theyve got something set up to make these so called witches look good
2301796 theyll pull some sort of flim flam well think were getting somebody special and itll be completely bogus
2301797 we can control events in the sgc out there we might have all sorts of magicians tricks thrown at us by colonel maybourne and his people
2301798 if theres no such thing as witches real witches a good magician might be the next best thing
2301799 were not going down that line if we cant come up with the real thing then thats the way itll have to be these things have a way of coming back to bite you were not in this to scam anybody whatever colonel maybourne might think
2301800 ill give you their full details if you decide to take them on
2301801 thats if we decide we want to work with you
2301802 coming here wasnt our idea none of us are looking for a job
2301803 sorry i was just thinking out loud three witches is there something about the number three with you people
2301804 perhaps youd better tell us what the hurly burlys all about
2301805 us people are regular people just like everybody else if theres a good reason to help thats what well do but we need to know what this is all about first
2301806 first we need to know if you have the skills we need
2301807 were dealing with some people who are comfortable dealing with what they call witches i understand that you all uh practice as witches exactly what is it you do
2301808 we mostly sit around stirring big black cauldrons chanting bad poetry so we can turn princes into frogs
2301809 maybe one of them has some sort of interrupter that
2301810 we can play this game all day us doing some little thing and you trying to come up with some sort of scientific explanation things are too serious for that so well cut to the chase what im going to show you is to remain a secret and is not to be passed onto anybody else outside this room if it is then all bets are off
2301811 first turn off all your recording equipment and give me your agreement to keep all this confidential
2301812 right there is no recording or surveillance equipment in operation you can speak freely
2301813 you can use this but im afraid it cant pick up a signal this far underground
2301814 its all to do with one of my visions we need a big demonstration we dont have the time to mess around
2301815 paige is also a witch and as you can see she has quite a lot of power of her own
2301816 phoebe halliwell youngest of three sisters well youve got that wrong phoebes older than me writes the ask phoebe column in the san francisco bay mirror and
2301817 we can if necessary put pressure on her via her sisters to make sure she co operates with us
2301818 mary crane has a circle of friends including fianc michael zimmer should be no difficulty in persuading her to do whatever is necessary elise montgomery
2301819 you are all free to go no pressure will be put on you to work with us i will make absolutely sure of that
2301820 stay here please this may not be as serious as it sounds
2301821 give me a clue where are we whats going on
2301822 we might be able to find whoever gave us those shots
2301823 i think i can teleport us away from here but i want to have a look outside first i dont want to land in the middle of the ocean
2301824 so this nid lot have got something to do with buffy and faith disappearing
2301825 they may not be the ones responsible for buffy and faith disappearing
2301826 but it might have been buffy and faith who knocked them out
2301827 theyve probably woken up by now we were gonna call you guys but we saw there were more of them outside so we went out the back way and came here
2301828 wouldnt you have been safer staying there with the protection spell
2301829 i made sure they couldnt see us we were in no danger
2301830 theyre probably talking to the other three guys out back as well
2301831 hes telling the others about what he could see of our security arrangements
2301832 we might then have a chance to find out what this is all about theyll probably wait for a few hours until its really quiet
2301833 after what happened in the magic box theyre probably being cautious
2301834 otherwise that guy would probably have pulled a gun on you
2301835 it would have been the last thing he ever did
2301836 well whoever they are they certainly train their agents properly
2301837 just like they were after amy and anya all witches see theyre some sort of witch kidnap squad
2301838 i dont know ive never heard of anything like it before
2301839 i didnt think they could damage the iris from the other side
2301840 by the time we tried to shut the iris it was too late some of those things had already come through the gate they started to destroy the iris pretty well straight away
2301841 captain you come with me and everybody else arm yourselves major you keep
2301842 i didnt close it down i think it was the uh witches down there they must have broken the connection somehow
2301843 if shes still asleep ill carry her to the water still no signs of life
2301844 ill climb one in a minute see if i can see anything were gonna need more than water before long
2301845 itll hurt a little she said a little just wait til i see willow again
2301846 perhaps it hurts because you didnt have that stuff that willow and tara used
2301847 when i got to talk to one of the guys in charge he claimed to be a government agent he never said anything about being on another world
2301848 theyve found out some witches have real power and they want to control it
2301849 i didnt realise it at first but all the other women did exactly what they were told to do i dont know if its drugs magic or something else but theyre all under control
2301850 the one that stops anybody else taking control of your free will its hidden by magic so they wouldnt even have seen it while i was unconscious
2301851 that explains why that guard just assumed wed follow him
2301852 they must have given us the same treatment since were also wearing willows amulets
2301853 so if one lot are government agents who were they fighting
2301854 somebody attacked but nobody told us who it was when the fighting started we were all told to stay where we were i decided not to and ran upstairs when nobody was looking
2301855 i cant see this is really an official government operation
2301856 perhaps the other lot are the local natives and they dont like us being here
2301857 make sure that plan includes a nice meal and a bath
2301858 with these special glasses we can see you quite clearly both of you
2301859 we know you teleported away from the goauld base so were hoping youre on our side
2301860 well wed like you to keep our secrets everything about the stargate comes under the heading of national security
2301861 now the replicators have access to a stargate weve got to move quickly to stop them destroying who knows how many worlds
2301862 weve got to go to the world they just came from as quickly as we can to try to stop them going anywhere else
2301863 if possible wed like you ladies to go with us you seem to have a certain way with these things
2301864 even as we speak they may be using the stargate they may have used it before they attacked us
2301865 theres always a way thats why i get those visions theres always a way to stop it happening
2301866 do you think your vision means were meant to help other worlds where do we stop
2301867 there are people human people on these other worlds that might be destroyed by these things
2301868 but i need to do a little research first could we all meet back here about the same time tomorrow
2301869 if my idea works out the delay wont make any difference
2301870 and we need to make our own preparations as well
2301871 weve also got to complete repairs to the iris before we power up again we meet again back here same time tomorrow i really hope you can help us but even if you cant weve got to make a move ourselves then
2301872 until now many here were convinced there was no such thing as a witch a real witch with magic power
2301873 is it true they dont have a reflection in a mirror
2301874 because down here no sunlight this is just the sort of place theyd love
2301875 mid twenties dark hair attractive she said she wasnt a witch but she sometimes did magic
2301876 i think she did it was a bit strange but it was certainly english
2301877 those little metal monsters we call them replicators she said wed be up against the replicators again soon and we were in fact i dont think wed have continued to look for witches if it wasnt for what she said
2301878 shes a vampire alright one of the very rare good vampires generally if you meet a vampire you want to run a mile if you can
2301879 most industrial countries are showing symptoms of over heating in the housing market
2301880 one simply cannot ignore the number of indicators that are now simultaneously exhibiting marked deviations
2301881 weve had a 30 year leveraging up of america ending in an unchecked orgy
2301882 the final straw was the feds hopelessly slow tightening from 2004 onwards there was no excuse for the interest rates of 1pc and then they went through this ludicrous metronome dance of quarter point hikes
2301883 by making banks raise capital against their balance sheets it gave them a strong incentive to move off balance sheets
2301884 if one bank gets in to trouble it is clearly the fault of the bank if most get into trouble it is the fault of the government and central bank the facts that a few banks like jp morgan might have seen the housing market risks and could afford to stay out away from the risk or just got lucky does not mean that the government is not guilty of a policy failure
2301885 presumably those cracks will get less and less in number as human beings become more and more experienced as a result of making mistakes
2301886 the real reason for crises which aep mentions is neither regulation nor
2301887 i dont think more regulation will help the only thing that will help in the long run will be for people to learn that a share price that is too high is dangerous that interest rates that are too low are a trap and that there is no free money and no magic business models
2301888 i think theres a lot of misunderstanding about the roles and responsibilities of regulators
2301889 but it would impose much greater stresses on the dwindling resources of the planet
2301890 to get inflation down to 2 and keep it there required the very high real interest rates in force in the eighties to purge the inflationary excesses of the seventies to be maintained throughout the nineties this made the western economies moribund and drove nominal interest rates ever lower
2301891 democracy can be flexible and more speedily flexible in a better direction than the dictatorships
2301892 rating agencies are supposed to get their ratings somewhat close to reality and didnt
2301893 failure has been in technical areas of risk management and bond rating
2301894 the federal reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen there is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the international bankers
2301895 the few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from either class
2301896 to attempt to portray the financial institutions as poor children led astray by the wicked actions of the various governments is novel but unconvincing surely they should have been able to act as organisations with some sense of self preservation yet all we got was mindless pocket lining as chaotic amp self serving as to quote p j orourke chimps at a salad bar if people have lost faith in financial institutions its because theyve behaved like fools and we apparently are to bail them out for it
2301897 we must blame capitalism for this fiasco otherwise it wont learn and it will go on practising without moral hazard in the future
2301898 this is not one of aeps brightest columns it was financial capital itself that relentlessly called for and got government deregulation this allowed financiers to take virtually any risk and they did and now we must pay
2301899 i think youve missed aeps point somewhat although the banks should nmot have done what they did they were pushed into by the fed
2301900 the roman world must have been a free market economy yet ive never read anything about boom and bust
2301901 global solutions for global problems to ensure continued global prosperity and security
2301902 missing is any hint of apology for his role in incubating this crisis as monetary overlord for 20 years
2301903 if it was a little complex and not just a brick box then at a push a day and a half
2301904 it derives from the milton friedman doctrine that the slumps can always be avoided by monetary stimulus loutrance to the utmost if only life were so simple
2301905 interest rates were being held too low for safety in most of the worlds mature economies
2301906 one cannot ignore the number of indicators that are now simultaneously exhibiting marked deviations

2302101 while rbs does face the threat of further writedowns and or a uk recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on writedowns and has the benefit of diversification away from the uk
2302102 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2302103 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns

2302118 the keyboard employs a whole series of perverse tricks designed to force typists to type as slowly as possible such as scattering the most common letters over all keyboard rows and concentrating them on the left side where right handed people have to use their weaker hand the reason behind all those seemingly counterproductive features is that the typewriters of 1873 jammed if adjacent keys were struck in quick succession so that manufactures had to slow down typists

2302181 im not going to be the vice presidential nominee or vice president im going to help sen mccain get elected as governor of louisiana let me be clear i have said in every private and public conversation ive got the job that i want
2302182 sometimes a defeat like that is the best thing that can happen to you
2302183 heerenveen do it right and thats something for us to learn and to aspire to it shows you it can be done and thats our target
2302184 they showed us the way its done in the final third they are a right good side and its a lesson we have to learn so i hope we can aspire to that
2302185 hopefully we can hit those heights if we keep working hard
2302186 at the own goal i thought gerard aafjes had it but it came down and hit off my knee but it was good youre getting tested out there in games like this
2302187 we wanted to win the game but it was a good test for us and you learn more from it
2302188 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it
2302189 we just have to face it and get on with it
2302190 there was always a hope that we could pick ourselves up for this game and there was also a matter of pride of playing in europe again
2302191 we enjoyed the run we had last season but we are not going to get one this season and thats a disappointment for us
2302192 the championship is a long way off after a night like tonight ive got enough problems picking everyone up for falkirk on saturday
2302193 you can use all the excuses you want but there should have been enough left in the team to handle this
2302194 no disrespect to kaunas they set their stall out well in both games and there are things we just have to take on board its a huge disappointment for everyone
2302195 as things look at the moment i would say yes but we just have to sit down in the morning and see what happens
2302196 that was the first time my players had played in glasgow with an atmosphere like the one at ibrox
2302197 the first leg for us was the dangerous one because we dont have 40 000 supporters we wanted a good result and 0 0 was a good result for us
2302198 the team always believed it was possible in their home park
2302199 we didnt take a lot from today apart from the fact we were well beaten the first half was the best part for us because in the second half we were poor
2302200 but overall liverpool were better and we can have no complaints about the result they could have scored more actually
2302201 the financial aspect has been the same for years theres no point me complaining about it
2302202 i dont think morale will be a problem on tuesday because this was a friendly
2302203 kyle did okay but when any new player comes in it takes a while for the players around him to get to know him
2302204 he played wide on the left for burnley but i think hes more naturally a striker and thats where hell probably play for us once we settle down a wee bit
2302205 the team showed from the start they wanted to win against a good team in the first half
2302206 we had plenty of possession and although we had a few small problems before half time we dealt with them the second half was more open and much easier for us
2302207 robbie is a fantastic professional and didnt let it bother him
2302208 both keane and torres made a lot of good movements and we had five offensive players today who can hurt teams
2302209 rangers had to come forward in the second half and that meant we were able to counter attack ngog showed his quality too and hell play league games this year
2302210 the encouraging thing is we are creating chances we have skilful guys like mehdi taouil and david fernandez and theyre ideal for someone like me
2302211 when i go on a run then nine times out of ten they will pick me out unfortunately i didnt take my chances today but ive no doubt with a lot of hard luck and a little but of luck ill get the goals starting against hibs on saturday
2302212 coming to the spl is a big challenge for me but im getting used to kilmarnocks style of play
2302213 i havent set myself any targets yet i just want to force myself into the team first of all and then ill think about my ambitions
2302214 what ive sensed already is how hungry the boys here are to make up for the disappointments they had last season
2302215 a good start is huge for any team and were looking to get some positive results on the board straight away
2302216 were not looking for him to bear the full brunt of our hopes but hes a lad who will get better and better
2302217 hell need a goal or two to kick on and then hell be a real handful
2302218 i asked them to up their performance in the second half and they did that the tempo was a whole lot better from our point of view and i dont think theres any doubt we deserved the victory
2302219 damien rascle had been doing well in goal but he felt his groin tighten and with alan combe also struggling we felt we had to take him off
2302220 ryan oleary had also done well in defence but he had a hamstring problem
2302221 we started slowly but for the last 25 minutes of the first half we played some great stuff i was delighted with that and told them in the dressing room to keep that going
2302222 but we were a bit flat when we went back out and the changes definitely had something to do with that
2302223 he went over on his ankle in training but theres still a chance we could take him on loan
2302224 coventry have arranged some bounce matches and once donovans fit again i can have another look at him
2302225 francisco showed again he has a natural instinct in front of goal
2302226 it was a great finish hes a player i really like and he showed why i brought him here
2302227 hes quick dangerous in the box and has shown hes capable of producing a finish as well
2302228 hes still not fully fit yet so well keep working on that this week before the hamilton game
2302229 the reaction from the united supporters was fantastic they are great fans and im glad theyve enjoyed their trip down here
2302230 all the players were talking in training about the fact we hadnt scored and it was great to finally get one
2302231 but im still disappointed that we were beaten i thought if i didnt start scoring id be put on the bench so it was nice to score
2302232 we knew that if we just kept playing then wed get the goal and we didnt really let it prey on our minds
2302233 we were bursting the net in training and we just thought if we kept doing that the goals will come
2302234 i still have a lot to learn i still have to work on my right foot as you saw today when i sent one into the stands
2302235 well announce his name if he signs for us lets leave it at that
2302236 it was a game we should have won we played well for 70 minutes but then we had a lapse in concentration at three crosses
2302237 we must do better than that its all about staying focused and concentrating and the players heads went a little bit
2302238 you have to remember we were facing a really good side with skilful players but im disappointed at the goals we conceded we need to work hard first and the quality will come after that i pleased with the effort and determination
2302239 if the letter of the law had been obeyed some of their players wouldnt have been on the park but it was understood before the game that wouldnt be the case now we have celtic and we are looking forward to it
2302240 these are the games that you want to play the players will be be back in on monday when preparations really start
2302241 when life in the county gets even more dangerous tom is sent to be trained with bill arkwright another spook arkwright lives in a haunted mill on the edge of a treacherous marsh and his training methods are harsh he has toughened up many previous apprentices though and must now do the same for tom but when the fiend sends his own daughter a powerful water witch to destroy tom arkwright makes an error of judgement and tom finds himself facing his enemies alone the spook and alice hasten to his aid but will even their combined strength suffice in the face of such dark power and what is the spooks mistake the consequences which might give final victory to the dark

2302244 from 2005 til today weve had 14 babies born with syphilis which is a totally preventable condition
2302245 over the last four or five years weve seen quite a number of new syphilis cases
2302246 weve seen an increase specifically in infectious syphilis from 1997 to 2006 in the order of about 1 000 per cent going from 115 cases up to about 1 200
2302247 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2302248 prescribers should be aware of the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when simvastatin is prescribed with amiodarone and they should avoid doses of simvastatin greater than 20 mg per day in patients taking amiodarone

2302261 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2302262 if we can get ourselves in front we can be confident but it will be an awkward one
2302263 we have that confidence there is no doubt but i need to point out that because we had that success last season it doesnt mean it will happen this season
2302264 we need to be wary of that aspect we just need to put in a performance that matches that confidence
2302265 i feel as though we are capable of winning the game but i dont like to keep looking back at last season thats finished and we should look forward now
2302266 last season we worked hard and there was a brightness about us but we should be better placed next week
2302267 there is no excuse really for us with the importance of the fixture i thought we would have started brighter
2302268 we didnt and thats something we will have to improve on i felt we started the game slowly and i thought there would be a bit more pace and passing of the ball
2302269 but credit to kaunas they defended well throughout the evening just before half time was our best spell in the game and we had a couple of clear cut opportunities that we might have done better with
2302270 it was a difficult second half kaunas defended very well and restricted us to two clear cut chances
2302271 i thought rangers were the favourites and after this first match i still think that rangers are the favourites
2302272 i thought rangers would cause us more problems but the second leg could be decided in the last 20 minutes and a team who have experience are of course at an advantage
2302273 this was a very good result but its not finished
2302274 im not sure if the way we played is how well play away in the champions league thats a question for the manager
2302275 but weve thrown away a lot of points in away ties weve definitely got to get our act together and get some points on the board in europe
2302276 porto won the champions league and theyre usually in the last 16 of the competition we didnt have a lot of the ball but the win was a good way to end the trip
2302277 now i am frustrated by womens bras this season the stores i visited target j c penney and kohls are showing only the heavily padded models goodness gracious not everyone wants that kind of armor
2302278 actually look like the purchaser is planning to hook up to a plow and do some heavy plowing
2302279 i think the movie shows the extent one goes to try to achieve a dream
2302280 the boys contacted me because of i guess my long r sum
2302281 and they said that they would like to do a documentary about me going back and i accepted and they followed me around for a week or two
2302282 a lot of these films that we have playing at the festival this year many of them the lgbt content is just whats the word im looking for its not the main storyline it just happens to have gay and lesbian characters but the fact that theyre gay and lesbian its not the main theme
2302283 if you watch this film there is very little lgbt content
2302284 one of the characters happens to be gay but the film is not about being gay
2302285 i think theres a danger of exhausting yourself in a dramatic arena
2302286 for dramas i think it relies on a sincerity and an honesty you need a hundred percent investment in and i needed to recharge those batteries to make sure i was doing service to the subject matter
2302287 he met up with judd apatow and seth rogen on the set of knocked up and they told him they were looking for a director for this movie
2302288 and he told them that i was looking to do a comedy and he set us up on a blind date and we made love so to speak
2302289 he directed a movie one time and couldnt find anyone to be naked in it so i did total nudity for one of his short films im doing nude pull ups in the locker room of a high school
2302290 he kept thinking i was kidding until i got in there i took all his sideburns off and then his armpit hair made him gain some weight it was a fun process

2302300 it was so exciting to have made it to the finals
2302301 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
2302302 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
2302303 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

2302308 sometimes western christians dont understand the freedom thats within china so i could imagine people arriving in beijing with two huge suitcases full of bibles thinking its a good thing
2302309 but what you want in china is legally printed bibles
2302310 many people dont believe that weve been printing bibles legally in china for the last 20 years
2302311 reflects the greater openness and if i may say the greater confidence of the communist party and the government
2302312 they do not want any particular religion to create a spark that will set a fire
2302313 anyone who claims to be an evangelical and who says its possible to go to heaven other than through faith in jesus christ is not an evangelical
2302314 i can affirm the particularities of my belief in jesus and in the gospels and affirm the idea that there are other paths
2302315 we intend to go into the field and probe this question in greater depth

2302321 i think hes got a big future but i thought adam rooney also did well and were keen to sign him too
2302322 i believe i can score at premier league level and im determined to score as many goals as i possibly can
2302323 i was disappointed if truth be told with the second half and the skipper caldwell knows he should have done better for the goal
2302324 i didnt like to drink but agency people used to drink like characters in irish novels i looked around and decided that martinis looked sophisticated especially if you were holding a cigarette and maybe even wearing a hat i concentrated on martinis until finally i enjoyed them
2302325 pork and beans video only this morning its probably the best music video ive seen for quite awhile even after 16 years of playing together long after most bands fizzle out
2302326 so far its neck and neck between athletics and swimming
2302327 it provided an explanation about what the world wide web was how one could own a browser and how to set up a web server it was also the worlds first web directory since berners lee maintained a list of other web sites apart from his own
2302328 dat was een leuk meisje ik ben benieuwd hoe ze eruit ziet als ze gewone kleren aan heeft
2302329 owjee ik heb een joggingbroek aan wat zal hij van me denken nu vindt hij me vast niet leuk
2302330 plunk the code in your directory and call it using include mylibrary
2302331 first you have to instantiate the class with the value of the website youll be scraping then iterate through it by calling the read member function until it returns a null value
2302332 there will be trouble but the firestorm that followed surprised even me
2302333 has become more accepting of womens roles and parenting in the wider society but once again women felt they were being handed a script for their lives that they couldnt follow
2302334 gives a woman only one role the single woman exists in the proclamation only as daughter of heavenly parents waiting to fulfill her destiny being a mother is a good and a necessary role but a good mother must first be a good person with roles and needs outside that of mother
2302335 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2302336 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2302337 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2302338 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2302339 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2302340 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2302341 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2302342 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2302343 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2302344 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2302345 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2302346 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2302347 people of the human sphere i am still alive last comic standing cannot kill me nothing can i fired a twinkie out of
2302348 tired of the same cookie cutter media buys come see how different we are
2302349 even with the near term challenges posed to print media by a more fragmented information environment and the economic headwinds facing all advertising media newspaper publishers are continuing to drive strong revenue growth from their increasingly robust web platforms
2302350 for applications that actually matter and are not the expression suite
2302351 this is embarrassing for me but i have a permanent erection which causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment i was wondering what you could give me for it
2302352 this is a human rights issue we ought to be concerned with
2302353 how did i end up here and how do i get to where i want to be
2302354 i choose to believe that everything will work out just fine
2302355 i choose to believe that i control my thoughts and emotions
2302356 i choose to believe that great success is my destiny
2302357 would you jump off a bridge because everyone else is doing it
2302358 use the social technographics profile to verify that you customers are
2302359 if half of them are joiners then marketing through social networks makes sense
2302360 brands like victorias secret adidas jeep target and apple have loyal followers who will friend them a company like sears without such avid brand enthusiasts will have to think and work a little harder
2302361 the existence of groups like this shouldnt discourage brands making friends with them will help you get your own group off the ground
2302362 how will you enable that how will you respond to wall postings and what interactive elements wallpaper badges widgets will you provide so that people can spread your brand or message
2302363 youll need staff responsible for programming the page and responding to comments just as if it were part of your web site then prime the pump with a little advertising to your targeted audience and watch the people spread your messages
2302364 what weve found is that advertisers and agencies are only interested in professional media so professional content providers are having a good time finding extremely high demand because they have a lack of video views
2302365 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

2302374 i do not think about things i dont think about
2302375 while we do support an investigation we dont believe that all the facts were properly aired in this case
2302376 does not sufficiently take into account the situation on the ground
2302377 this was a premeditated attack on the international personnel in kosovo
2302378 the demonstrators had access to long barreled weapons to petrol bombs to grenades these are not things found lying around the average courtroom
2302379 prescribers should be aware of the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when simvastatin is prescribed with amiodarone and they should avoid doses of simvastatin greater than 20 mg per day in patients taking amiodarone
2302380 if you are starting therapy with simvastatin or your dose of simvastatin is being increased contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms of unexplained muscle injury such as muscle cramps pain tenderness stiffness or spasm
2302381 an im all like you iran im a ing global superpower yknow im not here to make no ing friends
2302382 a small number of dickheads who when it comes down to it just want to stab people
2302383 already recognise the fact that theyre breaking the law and hurting people
2302384 i mean im running around the streets with a lethal weapon and stabbing people you wouldve thought everyone would just shut up talking about it and arrest me already
2302385 while we will not comment on the report until weve had a proper chance to explore its findings and select the ones which already agree with our position i would like to assure everyone that this government is determined to spend an excessive amount of time energy and taxpayers money debating and discussing this issue
2302386 the problem we face in parliament is that we find it difficult to associate with these youths carrying knives how can we come up with a solution until we understand every aspect of what were dealing with back to basics is about starting at the very beginning and asking the question what is a knife the new knife tsar is the perfect person to answer that question
2302387 this man knows better than anyone else what is a knife and what isnt
2302388 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2302389 it seems the alpha lipoic acid fools the body into behaving as if it was still on whatever diet it was following before the supplement was added
2302390 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2302391 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2302392 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopts from overseas but thats not what i found
2302393 more women get custody of children in divorce cases so after a divorce the mom is living with her kids and she meets a man and they get married and he adopts her children
2302394 this is the very first national data weve had on mens lifetime adoption experiences
2302395 now we know some of the real implications of this
2302396 these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2302397 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumours coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2302398 do ye to them as is good in your eyes
2302399 they were the ones who followed balaams advice and were the means of turning the israelites away from the lord in what happened at peor so that a plague struck the lords people now kill all the boys and kill every woman who has slept with a man but
2302400 theres an innocent village over there if you hide out in the vineyard waiting for the daughters of the villagers to come a dancing and a celebrating at a feast in honour of god i might add you can simply take them for your own
2302401 humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you
2302402 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2302403 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2302404 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2302405 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2302406 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2302407 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2302408 were all born somewhere on that continuum but all the training in the world can only move you a little bit
2302409 nutrition is key in anybodys life whether were professional athletes or working at a desk
2302410 people stress about the calorie content of protein but they should be stressing about sugar
2302411 you want to keep your body running so efficiently that everything youre using is converted to energy and your body doesnt store anything
2302412 if your clothes fit great and you like the way you look in the mirror does it matter what the scale says
2302413 its like age you could be 45 but feel 30 age and weight are just numbers that we get obsessed with but they dont mean were healthy
2302414 the more intense the training is the more youre going to reach your potential
2302415 you will not find an olympic athlete who is not highly highly trained they dont roll out of bed and win the 100 meter sprint or the 50 freestyle they spend hours and hours of training of all sorts
2302416 people are hesitant at the beginning to spend the money with a personal trainer but after a month when theyre tightening their waistband and their shorts are loose they really see the results
2302417 after a while you adjust to the expense and it becomes part of your lifestyle
2302418 i dont think the coalition and democracy are so weak that any person can use article 58 2 b
2302419 also boosted the image of the political leadership in the eyes of the general public
2302420 the bold decision taken by the leaders is being interpreted by political analysts as a crucial move which if backfired could have serious ramifications for future of democracy in the country and if it meets success the salutary impact it would have on the democratic process would be immeasurable

2302427 we will remember this tragedy for the rest of our lives
2302428 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2302429 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2302430 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2302431 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2302432 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished

2302434 without action a verbal decision is just so much hot air
2302435 hello mother hello father here i am at camp granada and this year the foods improving cuz the little black things in it are not moving
2302436 well our supply chain makes us more efficient and saves us lots of money and we meet most customers needs just fine and everyone else is doing it and our stockholders expect us to blah blah blah
2302437 they might win this week who knows thats the kind of year theyve had theyve been able to surprise you when you least expect it
2302438 we can only hope that we can win a couple more and just get further ahead of the competition when the final 10 starts
2302439 the bonus points that he has right now i think thats the only advantage he has
2302440 they just havent shown to me what they were showing earlier in the season but going into it with a 70 or a 40 point deficit which is kind of where were at right now thats a lot of points to try to make up when you havent been able to have the dominating wins like we had last year
2302441 having a string like weve had here winning four of the nine years ive been here thats something that were really really proud of
2302442 i mean batting 300 will get you in the baseball hall of fame and were over 400 right now at the glen
2302443 the glens elevation changes and slight banking in the turns should keep the water from standing and provide the drivers with challenging conditions
2302444 but we dont necessarily look toward that what we look toward right now is making our car the best that we can make it so we can be a contender in the race
2302445 im very happy and relieved to have a deal in place that will keep me with andretti green for a long time
2302446 weve been very good together since the start of 2003 and i believe we can continue to be good for many more years
2302447 i wont hide for you that this kind of thing is really not the type of problem that interests us
2302448 there are in my opinion far more important things than paparazzi taking photos of a glamor couple
2302449 high crimes the fate of everest in an age of greed
2302450 kodas has written a disturbing account of stupidity and greed on the slopes of mount everest on assignment for the hartford courant in 2004 kodas joined an expedition led by a couple who had summited the mountain more than a dozen times between them as he moved up everest kodas watched his expedition disintegrate in a mess of recriminations thefts lies and violence at the same time a sociopathic guide was leading a 69 year old doctor to his death on the unforgiving slopes the twin disasters led kodas to delve into the commercialization of mount everest and to discover that such experiences were becoming a depressing norm a thorough reporter kodas does an excellent job exposing the ways in which money and ego have corrupted the traditional cultures of both mountaineers and their sherpa guides he also brings a painful focus to the delusions misunderstandings and indifference that allow climbers to literally step over the bodies of dying people on their way to the top

2302453 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2302454 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2302455 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2302456 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2302457 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2302458 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2302459 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2302460 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2302461 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2302462 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2302463 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2302464 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2302466 the free flow of information is at the heart of every librarys work thats why congress passed a law limiting the fbis power to issue nsls to americas libraries
2302467 while its never easy standing up to the government particularly when i was barred from discussing it with anyone i knew i had to challenge something that was clearly wrong im grateful that i am able now to talk about what happened to me so that other libraries can learn how they can fight back from these overreaching demands
2302468 its just one day when teenagers can get away from their parents and have fun and listen to music
2302469 it just seems to be a scandalous waste they want to dig up one of the most prized parks possibly two in hammersmith and fulham
2302470 for them to propose the park plan when they had this piece of land here where they are building luxury flats is quite frankly a disgrace
2302471 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public

2302500 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2302501 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2302502 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2302503 it is important that these cases go forward at the pace that justice requires
2302504 prosecutors cannot should not accelerate cases but should try them with as much dispatch as they can recognizing that timely justice is appropriate both for the accused and society

2302784 i think doing this play has shifted my whole perspective on it and its been an incredible profound experience ive been moved by how much women want to change their self hatred how preoccupied they are with it and how much they want to break through and get out of it
2302785 i suppose i had this fantasy that after finally coming home into my vagina i could relax get on with my life
2302786 this was not the case the deadly self hatred simply moved into another part of my body
2302787 the good body began with me and my particular obsession with my imperfect stomach i have charted this self hatred recorded it tried to follow it back to its source here unlike the women in the vagina monologues i am my own victim my own perpetrator
2302788 i bought into the idea that if my stomach were flat then i would be good and i would be safe i would be protected i would be accepted admired important loved
2302789 i think all of capitalism is based on creating this fear inside people that something is wrong with them and that theyre messed up so that they have to correct it and they have to buy products in order to fix it
2302790 we women we just think that everything is wrong with us our thighs our skin our butts our hair our nose our feet our stomachs and then we busily consume 40 billion a year to fix it
2302791 it really doesnt matter what it is thats wrong it is the ongoing perpetuation of that ideology which is youre born ugly youre born stupid youre born fat and we as capitalists are going to help you make it better
2302792 you go to china and you see eating disorders emerging or in india where women used to love their roundness now theyre all obsessed with beauty pageant girls and being skinny these images are so powerful theyre almost undeniable i think part of what is happening is that were not just sick ourselves but were contaminating the world its self hatred flu instead of bird flu weve got self hatred flu that were pumping through the world

2302820 i cant deny it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will and it is unusual for anybody to want to leave united
2302821 he is happy here we have ended all the stuff about real madrid and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more it does happen to players the longer they stay at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2302822 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club he has a big influence in the dressing room now
2302823 its not easy for young people to come to our country they have to settle in get used to the culture and get used to the dressing room
2302824 thats what we have experienced with quite a few of them vidic has settled now when he first came his wife was expecting there were a lot of things to get used to coming to manchester from russia it takes time and we hope that all the players we have settle here and have great careers at the club

2302859 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2302860 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2302861 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2302862 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2302863 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2302864 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2302865 i just want people to know nothing is going to happen right away
2302866 at the optimum things wont be ready until september 2011
2302867 this preliminary schedule was developed just working around a june 2009 referendum date that you informed me of
2302868 i would propose that this is a lengthy schedule and some of the individual line items may possibly be reduced in time frame or accelerated
2302869 its not to early to ask people who want to get involved to contact us
2302870 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2302871 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2302872 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2302873 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2302874 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2302875 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2302876 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2302877 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2302878 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2302879 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2302890 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2302891 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2302892 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2302893 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2302894 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2302895 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2302896 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2302897 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2302898 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2302899 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2302900 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2302902 a big part of this hamdan case has been gearing up for the trials of the high value detainees
2302903 nobody will say they are small fry and in each of those cases the government will be seeking the death penalty
2302904 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
2302905 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
2302906 if this isnt enough to validate the commissions against the strident and unfair criticism i dont what would be
2302907 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
2302908 chinese culture is so amazing the olympics are so hard earned

2302914 we would never be here today without them the mayors office and sfo have been so supportive we work with them all the time and its been a great partnership
2302915 we are doing great we are relatively small so our route network is very efficient the business model is very tech savvy and streamlined and because we are a startup we have some very enthusiastic and dedicated employees who are passionate about reinventing u s air travel which has been a good competitive advantage
2302916 the philosophy we have had since launch is that this is different and this is all about the consumer

2302940 this olympics has gone above and beyond it was special whether its your fourth or first
2302941 it was once in a lifetime i loved it i was speechless at times i really liked the torch and the guy flying through the air
2302942 it was really nice it was inspirational it made me want to compete
2302943 although i could not share the joy of holding the games with chinese i think china will bring brand new olympics with this fantastic ceremony
2302944 i will watch the beijing games from tonight since holding olympics in the most populous fastest growing and vigorous country will be a significant event for the human beings
2302945 the gathering of international athletes also proves that china is a friend of the world it is one world now
2302946 it has shown a great artistry of the director zhang yimou and changed my past view on china
2302947 i was deeply moved by the performing kids in the ceremony because they are so lovely
2302948 when japanese athletes pacing into the stadium i can hear from the tv chinese cheering and feel that it has come from inside of their hearts
2302949 although i cant sit in the birds nest to watch it i almost cried when the song chanting our motherland finished by the red little girl
2302950 its a glory that belongs to every chinese in the world
2302951 im very happy to see so many friends from all over the world come to beijing the olympic games is just like a seed that grows friendship and peace
2302952 usually i dont watch much sport events on tv but i never want to miss it this time
2302953 in newark edison first developed the method of team inventing that would characterize the rest of his career whenever a new idea for an invention inspired him he sketched it out in a notebook and then shared the drawing with batchelor and kruesi or other trusted assistants their job was to take the sketch and see that it was made into a working model
2302954 his assistant william dickson may have contributed as much or more to the invention of the movie camera than edison himself francis upton a mathematician was hired by edison to find out everything that was known about previous work on the light bulb nonetheless there was never any doubt that in the end all the inventions were edisons

2302980 we feel very strongly that liberia is changing for the better
2302981 liberia was at the forefront of similar role in the united nations
2302982 it is for this reason that we would like to pay special tribute to president ellen johnson sirleaf as the head of the executive and all members of the legislative branch the private sector faith based organizations the civil societies and the people of liberia for the efforts deployed to move liberia from a war torn country to a country that is on the path to recovery and development
2302983 we also believe that liberia is moving in the right direction as far as pursuing unity and reconciliation is concerned we sincerely hope that liberia can be peaceful forever but only liberians can keep the country together through unity in development in which all liberians have a role to play
2302984 we wish to pay a deserved tribute to the people of liberia and its leadership for the vital role played for the liberation of africa
2302985 the country has come out of the 17 years conflict with commitment and determination to give democracy a chance and to move expeditiously on the path of post conflict reconstruction and development
2302986 we from the 35 member africa forum recognize the enormous challenges ahead of the people and leadership of liberia but at the same time are confident that under the leadership of president sirleaf and in collaboration with the legislature the task of post conflict reconstruction and development is certainly not insurmountable
2302987 most of our countries are going through what we call the triple shocks of food insecurity the shock of poor health services and spread of hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis and the shock of energy
2302988 from our experience this is far from the truth the truth is that the real work actually starts after elections
2302989 we appeal to all opposition parties to engage the government with constructive criticism and bring positive suggestions and alternative solutions to the problems liberia is facing

2303065 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2303066 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2303067 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2303068 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2303069 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2303070 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2303071 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2303072 aaron has decided to go in a different direction as far as an agent
2303073 while i am disappointed with his decision i wish him the best
2303074 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2303075 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2303076 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2303077 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2303078 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2303079 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2303080 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation

2303223 definitely hes going to stay with us the coach bernd schuster has said he wants him in our team

2303226 robinho is very angry with the way the madrid bosses are dealing with him
2303227 he calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me about his future and i always have to tell him that no one has called
2303228 i have been trying to speak with someone from the club for three days robinho does not understand what is going on
2303229 his ambition is to become the best player in the world but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
2303230 he didnt like at all the idea of being fourth choice in the plans madrid have had this summer
2303231 first they wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo but couldnt their second option was rafael van der vaart third is valencia striker david villa robinho is fourth
2303232 robinhos plan was to play for real madrid for many years
2303233 but he no longer feels that way he is getting affection from chelsea coach luiz felipe scolari he knows robinho well and calls him every day
2303234 when he scored 25 goals the season before no one thought he could do better than that but i felt he could
2303235 i expected him to improve just as i expect him to improve next season
2303236 of course we are at a different level twenty five goals against 42 is totally different so if he only gets to 41 i will forgive him i am sure he will have a great season
2303237 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2303238 he is happy at manchester united and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more
2303239 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2303240 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2303241 i hope he starts to realise what it is about manchester united
2303242 as time goes on i also feel they begin to take on a role of older statesmen
2303243 you have people like gary neville paul scholes and ryan giggs rio ferdinand now has a big influence on the dressing room and so does edwin van der sar they are experienced players who have been through it all
2303244 it is not easy for young people coming from another country
2303245 it does not matter where they go they have to settle in and get used to another culture then they need to get used to the dressing room
2303246 but bit by bit they get a feel for the place
2303247 it doesnt just happen overnight but eventually we hope all the players settle to have great careers here
2303248 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2303249 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2303250 it is unusual for anyone to really want to leave manchester united and i think cristiano understands that too

2303299 we are investigating the cause of fire with our colleagues at central scotland fire and rescue service
2303300 eighty six houses were evacuated and the majority of people stayed with family and friends while the remainder went to the rest centre set up at the dobbie hall by falkirk council
2303301 nobody was hurt in this incident and the fire itself was quickly extinguished
2303302 however due to the presence of these cylinders there needs to be a significant cool down period before the cordons can be lifted
2303303 should republicans do everything they can to prevent liberal democrats from repealing the usa patriot act and other important laws that help our intelligence agencies protect america
2303304 should we do everything we can to stop democrats from weakening border security
2303305 should republicans unite to keep our pro growth achievements from the past seven year intact by blocking new federal government bureaucracy and red tape
2303306 should republicans in congress oppose the new wasteful government spending programs proposed by the democrats and their leaders nancy pelosi and harry reid
2303307 will you join the republican national committee by making a contribution today
2303308 yes i support the rnc and am enclosing my most generous contribution
2303309 yes i support the rnc but i am unable to participate at this time

2303312 it is an honour and a privilege for the historic city of stirling to be chosen as the only scottish venue to exhibit works of art that are among the greatest treasures of her majesty the queens collection
2303313 i would like to extend my gratitude and thanks to all who have been instrumental in ensuring that this unique exhibition comes to stirling
2303314 the friends of the smith the local community and local businesses have been an integral part in the preparation for the exhibition
2303315 never in a million years would i have imagined that we would have an opportunity like this
2303316 it has been like winning the lottery it seemed too good to be true but we looked into it a bit further and started to get excited
2303317 my only trouble has been selecting 16 members to play from our band of 26 no easy task but i was a very popular man for a time
2303318 we didnt even have a full set of uniforms never mind the funds to accommodate a trip to beijing
2303319 we got busy writing off to everyone we could think of for support and were amazed at the response
2303320 people we so keen to help and really pulled out all the stops for us
2303321 since our arrival in beijing we have all had a fantastic time the city is amazing and the people are fantastic
2303322 we have been practising every day and have had the full dress rehearsals inside the national stadium
2303323 what we have seen of the opening ceremony has been spectacular the amount of people involved is staggering

2303325 a majority 59 of small to medium sized business owners have identified branding as a top priority
2303326 anyone who worked in the mills or lived in the area between the 1940s and 1960s could have invaluable information that will help us to establish the history of dumping in the area
2303327 it is important that they come forward as this is a well used path
2303328 we are not looking for proof as such simply anecdotal evidence from locals who were connected to the mills and who can recall the dumping taking place
2303329 they bought us kentucky fried chicken and filmed us eating it
2303330 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things
2303331 its not about the money id just hate for little kids to be
2303332 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2303333 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2303334 the body was completely drained of blood this was important

2303371 pity harvard is also about as intellectually adventurous as a dead goldfish
2303372 i only wish the operation had come earlier and we would have not lost so many of our sons and friends here due to the bombings
2303373 i congratulate the millions of people and the mourning processions which took place with the utmost organisation showing great co ordination with the armed forces
2303374 the iraqis have said that theyd like to try to do it by the end of the year
2303375 we think that thats important we think that local elections would help in iraq to further reconcile all the groups
2303376 congress has clearly reflected a keen interest in just these kinds of choices
2303377 we want to make sure that we can help them understand the extent of these choices
2303378 what yahoo is doing is better than before but i think most consumers would expect that if they opt out then the information will no longer be collected
2303379 as a business we collect data for many reasons including legal reporting fraud detection financial auditing law enforcement compliance and research to improve our services
2303380 we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them greater choice
2303381 participates in a number of businesses related to internet advertising and each business facilitates the customization of advertising to some degree
2303382 related to commercially relevant categories for large audiences most interest categories are based on very popular topics such as travel autos or entertainment
2303383 yahoo does not customize advertising based on certain sensitive interest categories such as adult categories and sexual health to name just two
2303384 while there might be upside there the downside is much more significant
2303385 then even the kind of image being shown is not known
2303386 user agents must not run executable code embedded in the image resource
2303387 mind you last year was probably a once in 40 years kind of market
2303388 most of north america would kill to have our real estate market
2303389 whenever there is a bit of economic uncertainty the high end slows first
2303390 we could underprice it considerably and the market would correct it
2303391 i like to counteract that when buyers have that mentality by saying that i still think the canadian market is very healthy
2303392 i think some people are just a little bit more greedy than they should realistically be
2303393 are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the u s probably not
2303394 but its pretty clear that things are weakening and theyre going to continue weakening for some time
2303395 we never had that kind of credit excess in canada
2303396 i am worried right across the country that things are tightening up and that a year from now we are going to see a drop off
2303397 its quiet on the buyers side listings are up sales are down

2303416 ultimamente est sendo melhor jogar fora de casa do que dentro tem uma certa press o aqui na vila capanema e a gente n o est conseguindo jogar bem
2303417 o torcedor est cheio de raz o de cobrar nada melhor agora do que essas duas partidas fora de casa para buscarmos os resultados positivos voltar com confian a e retornar a jogar bem dentro de casa
2303418 fiquei contente pela renova o sinto me vontade na juventus e me integrei rapidamente com os companheiros
2303419 o que podemos dizer que em 20 dias em que estivemos aqui fizemos seis partidas com um m dia de tr s jogos por semana ent o o tempo foi muito curto e a dificuldade era conta da perda de alguns jogadores isso prejudicou bastante o planejamento que n s t nhamos
2303420 n o houve atrito nesse sentido mas a exig ncia era l gica e ficou muito claro a necessidade de refor os mais qualificados para buscar uma rea o dentro de um campeonato dif cil como o brasileir o os refor os tinham que chegar o mais r pido poss vel
2303421 manifestar se de forma desrespeitosa ou ofensiva contra membros do conselho nacional de esporte cne dos poderes das entidades desportivas ou da justi a desportiva e contra rbitro ou auxiliar em raz o de suas atribui es ou amea los
2303422 eu acho meio dif cil que em um est dio cheio daqueles um rbitro consiga escutar alguma coisa a dez metros de dist ncia
2303423 nossa expectativa absolver a n o ser que ele quarto rbitro tenha uma escuta na mesa dele o m nimo que um rbitro fica do treinador no campo dez metros e n o d pra escutar nada com a torcida gritando daquele jeito como fica
2303424 maybe it was replacing it with a new version or update
2303425 i bought it i experimented with it yesterday and while it wasnt perfect it did work
2303426 i didnt attempt to sync my iphone until sunday after the app was removed from the store which means it was never on my computer
2303427 i purchased my first hermes scarf when i was 16
2303428 i think it was 62 and i still own it
2303429 it wasnt a space where you wanted to go and hang out
2303430 you know that youre entering a special kind of space as you walk up the stairs
2303431 we all kind of cried when we saw the size of this monster thing
2303432 but it was something that had to be there so you have to be creative and design around it
2303433 definitely on the radar in fashion and interiors as a fashion forward colour
2303434 orange is rich warm happy and it makes a great accent
2303435 a lot of the history of hermes is not just equestrian but mariner
2303436 possessions can sometimes pull you down and dictate the way one has to live
2303437 its generally the antithesis of whats going on in this city
2303438 from a sustainability perspective the ground zero entry level gesture is to build small it was interesting that someone would twig on to that and in a very american way would make an entrepreneurial model out of it its really positive its the design for a community
2303439 its a different model a different recasting the smaller the house the more you use the city when you get into very large houses theres a kind of privatization of things that used to be activities that got you out into your community such as a gym or movie theatre or any kind of amenity space but when you have smaller houses even in a middle class neighbourhood you move out go out to the community centre the gym to the public school such houses speak volumes about ideas of civic life now it talks about that hankering for a sense of community
2303440 we downsized 1 500 square feet from our last house so we were nervous about whether we would have enough room but having lived there a couple of years i feel we could take off another 100 square feet and not even notice it
2303441 it has given us so much pleasure and its made us think differently about land in the city i dont think about our place as property i think of it as my land i love what happens every day on the roof its really a work in landscape
2303442 i think its a recapturing of the way we lived up to the post second world war period in europe people still go out into the city more to satisfy their needs play in the front yard play in the street this says a lot about what we think of civic life
2303443 i know and respect senator clinton and ive worked with her and with former president clinton in the past so i did not think it was appropriate
2303444 he disagreed with president carters policy he told carter he was going to resign but not before the raid took place as he did not want to do anything that might reduce the likelihood of its succeeding he said he would resign and duly did after the raid whether or not it succeeded
2303445 the ability to get what one wants through attraction rather than using the carrots and sticks of payment or coercion
2303446 concentrates too much on economic and military power and not enough on other sources which for the us range from hollywood to harvard
2303447 one of the most brilliant speakers we have with a remarkable ability to analyse and explain complicated issues
2303448 charlie blacks comment may have been politically incorrect but i continue to think that it is analytically correct thats the nice thing about being an academic
2303449 what is intriguing is how little difference there is we all feel that any new administration will have to put a high priority on multilateralism on strengthening international institutions and providing global public goods taking the lead on health climate change and so forth people have learnt the lessons of the past seven years but at a very high price
2303450 we have to stop exporting fear there are a number of steps any new administration can take notably closing guantanamo bay there are always difficulties in being the big kid on the block but were in trouble if we are seen as we certainly are at the moment as the bully
2303451 we changed our policies toward vietnam and developed policies that stressed human rights bipolarity and a soviet threat provided a favourable context for this but not the whole answer
2303452 while the us is undoubtedly internationally unpopular at the moment
2303453 that is a reflection of the policy of this administration rather than a rejection of american values how we disengage from iraq how we handle iran and how we make progress on the israel palestine peace process will be important for the muslim world also important will be changing to a leadership position on global climate change and the development of a more multilateral style in our approach to issues
2303454 the candidates differ most on when to leave iraq and about talking to iran without preconditions i agree with the obama position that we should enter a broad based discussion without preconditions he has been criticised for premature summitry by mccain but the discussions need not start at the summit
2303455 studies of leadership have tended to overemphasise the coercive element
2303456 coercion may be part of it but if you understand power as the ability to get what you want then attracting people to you is also important i found when i worked in government that there were people over whom i had no power that i needed to get on my side if i wanted to get things done and i had to learn how to attract them to support me
2303457 elements in his background he has an african grandmother and grew up in indonesia make him particularly capable of connecting to the rest of the world he has thought through the question of identity which is a fraught problem for america in a way that few people have done
2303458 he realises that in many peoples eyes he is black but he grew up in a white home he was simultaneously capable of editing the harvard law review and of going to work for black people in south chicago
2303459 working through those issues of identity has given him a knowledge of himself an emotional intelligence that is very important for a leader it has given him an ability to master his own emotions and reach out to other people in a way that attracts them to him
2303460 i think he has a better than even chance of winning
2303461 a year ago a republican consultant told me it would be edwards versus romney and he gets paid for that sort of thing
2303462 the day i went to the cottage the first time i was so impressed i called my realtor and bought a share in another cottage there
2303463 fractional cottages are the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry
2303464 there is a bit of angst about incremental changes in cottage country where it is a bit of a wild area
2303465 instead of having one family use the place for a short period of time during the year you have a situation with more people there all the time
2303466 there is the potential to be a positive thing on the landscape
2303467 everyone who sees it says what about the winter were going to find out before we start offering it and well be posting a diary and photos on our website
2303468 what were trying to do with this leed home and the grass driveway first and foremost is educate the public about what can be done to not only reduce energy consumption but to reduce the impact our homes have on the environment
2303469 basically plastic matting with honeycomb shaped voids on the surface laid down on a structural base and filled with topsoil
2303470 the river never freezes so they can fish all winter long
2303471 from billboards and brochures from books and magazines printed images compete for our attention there can hardly be a house in the developed world which does not have a print

2303479 mas ainda estamos esperando uma comunica o oficial do vit ria estamos negociando mas eles ainda n o responderam nossa proposta
2303480 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2303481 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2303482 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2303483 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2303484 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2303485 the direction is towards either a memorandum of understanding on their evacuation or a memorandum of understanding on a timetable for their withdrawal
2303486 the direction is towards either a memorandum of understanding on their evacuation or a memorandum of understanding on programming their presence
2303487 on substantive issues theres not much daylight between the two sides
2303488 the troops will leave when the iraqis are ready to take over but they iraqi leaders need to get what they need and to get cover for it it is politics how you package it how you sell it to your people they want our support but they also want to show that theres progress towards sovereignty
2303489 and with women its even more difficult since they can hide the bombs under their robes and policemen cant body search them
2303490 the terrorists are attacking the easiest targets crowded streets markets and so on just to deliver the message were still here
2303491 the only thing we can do is to keep up the pressure on the insurgents and keep them off balance
2303492 in reality the result is likely to be a document that says wed like to be at a certain point at a certain time rather than unqualified deadlines
2303493 i stand here before you a happy and humble frog
2303494 when i was a tadpole growing up back in the swamps i never imagined that i would one day address such an outstanding group of scholars
2303495 he did close his eyes for a second and that gave the press the picture and the story they wanted it shouldnt have been a surprise it rained all day and dylans people didnt want the media in the hall so we left them soaking outside for a couple of hours while he was smuggled in and out of a side entrance
2303496 i think thats what you might call a hostile press anyway its become legend now that he fell asleep completely untrue but thats rocknroll
2303497 it was the right decision he was worthy of an honorary degree
2303498 charlie doesnt have an academic bone in his body but he was utterly appropriate for an honorary degree because were in the home of golf were well placed to do that
2303499 universities that occasionally give degrees to celebrities find that the media want access to come to take a picture of the celebrity holding the scroll the media then become very serious and ask questions about whether they should be awarded that of course just gives them the chance to run the picture of the celebrity again
2303500 if anyone from the university community were to say im not happy about having that celebrity we would take notice of it
2303501 we get far more nominations than we get approvals its not a smoke filled room its quite a robust and open process
2303502 universities are in a unique position in being academically independent so they can do these things
2303503 we got a lot of criticism but we were able to fly the flag for dialogue we were strongly encouraged to do it no matter how much criticism we got
2303504 weve got some distinguished colleagues to look at the very particular issues around revoking the mugabe degree they came to some more general conclusions were working on those conclusions now i think the type of criteria will be fleshed out in more detail and more due diligence will be done
2303505 he encourages drivers to break speed limits and incites violence against cyclists while other universities are rewarding the likes of nelson mandela brookes is rolling out the carpet for a dangerous buffoon
2303506 contemptuously belittles those graduates who have toiled away for years to earn their qualification through merit and hard work
2303507 the school i run has a very successful suite of courses and other activities to do with motor sport engineering
2303508 one of the things we have noticed over the years is that there arent that many people who are good champions of engineering its central to the uk economy and if we were better at promoting it we might do better as an economy
2303509 our courses have been very successful at attracting students partly because its motor sport and its exciting but one of the great things about jeremy clarkson is that hes really passionate about it he really does love engineering and is genuinely very interested
2303510 when you talk to our students many of them are great fans of top gear they really like him hes enthusiastic about the things theyre interested in there are lots of young people who are switched on to engineering by the things he promotes
2303511 universities are made up of some diverse groups and we have to sit alongside each other its really critical that we provide people with sharp engineering skills that are pushing back the boundaries that for me doesnt sit uncomfortably next to concerns about the environment
2303512 in these cases students get a particular benefit theres no question that armstrong galvanised a group of researchers by his enthusiasm
2303513 its more likely that someone with j k rowling at their degree ceremony will go on to write a serious novel
2303514 staff at the university are invited to put forward people they think are deserving of an honorary award nominations are then made by the deans of schools department heads and the university executive
2303515 the nominations come from the grass roots theyre not dreamt up by a management committee i think a crucial factor for us is that we have some very senior professors on the advisory panel that will help it get the respect of the academic community
2303516 the process means that inappropriate nominations are taken out very early on
2303517 we dont actively court controversy we certainly dont do celebrity for celebritys sake
2303518 we do our own thing it may be entirely proper for other institutions to reflect a different kind of mission with honorary degrees what we do reflects our place ethos and subject mix
2303519 my sense is that the significance of a few controversial cases can be greatly exaggerated the fact is that there are so many more degree awarding institutions than there were a generation ago and therefore many more honorary degrees being conferred every year given that increase which goes with the increase in the number of new universities its inevitable that sooner or later there will be controversial choices
2303520 a great man a great occasion for us i dont know what it means to be a god king or a spiritual leader but whatever it is hes got it and it aint just showbusiness
2303521 to see the reaction of the tibetan students to being in the presence of the dalai lama was moving even for an old campaigner like myself
2303522 he wanted to accept the award because of his commitment to education and i think this is the important message he was reminding us i think in the west particularly that education is not just about material development though it is about that and not just about getting a job getting money buying things
2303523 he asked to take our bonnet to confer degrees with him into space we couldnt allow it but he took a piece of the velvet
2303524 like neil it had gone into space i couldnt imagine a more appropriate thing
2303525 tapping him with the medieval bonnet that had already had sewn into it a piece of university of edinburgh velvet that had been in space was just lovely
2303526 harvey is a maverick the extraordinary thing is that he was appointed in the first place his track record was known he is very much an academic and something like this was bound to happen sooner or later
2303527 when you work for one of these bodies you have to exercise a certain level of discretion you try to find a way through the conflicting pressures i dont think he would have even thought about things like that
2303528 it is only rumour but it doesnt matter whether it is a rumour or not that is what people think
2303529 i cant believe that ramsden did this off his own bat he would have been piqued by the letter because the nss is based on the course experience questionnaire that he helped to invent back in australia but i dont think he did it of his own volition
2303530 the sector believes that the academy is accountable to it but in reality the great bulk of its funding comes from the government and so it is bound to be susceptible to government influences too
2303531 my view is that we need a body that takes a neutral view something such as the kings fund in health or even ofqual the new office of the qualifications and examinations regulator which monitors school standards if the academy cannot do this then we may have to think afresh
2303532 he is a rather remote sort of character and is just not a natural leader of men if it was a university it wouldnt matter so much because there would be lots of other people around him but in a small organisation like the hea hes going to know all the staff and the staff are all going to know him theres nowhere to hide in an organisation of that size
2303533 felt the academy had yet to demonstrate the case for its continued existence
2303534 residual dissatisfaction across the academys staff base regarding the style of leadership by some senior managers
2303535 unfortunately despite our best efforts we anticipate that a letter and possibly a news story will appear in this weeks the on the subject we are still endeavouring to keep the details of the matter as confidential as possible
2303536 are used to being told what to do so it is no skin off their nose and while it will worry the people who actually teach students they dont have the opportunity to do anything about it
2303537 they can refuse to join the organisation but that will probably make it very difficult for them to get promoted they can write letters saying they think it is a disgrace but the organisation ignores them they can threaten to vote for candidates who are anti the leadership in elections but there wont be another election for three years and its only four out of 16 posts on the academic council that are elected and were ignored anyway
2303538 the hea has lost respect and credibility but they dont seem to worry about that at all
2303539 the hea issued a statement saying that it was committed to academic freedom then just brazened it out
2303540 it is very hard to get through that sort of carapace but if they are allowed to get away with it then sooner or later a vice chancellor will think oh ill do the same thing and then academic freedom really will be dead this is the stuff of which disasters are made
2303541 help institutions discipline groups and all staff to provide the best possible learning experience for their students
2303542 there is plenty of evidence that our universities and colleges are taking the quality of teaching and the student experience more and more seriously
2303543 its core business for them teaching and student support are important to everyone academics universities and colleges employers governments and students themselves
2303544 the heas new strategic plan seizes the opportunity to set the agenda for the next three years by supporting teaching influencing policy sharing good practice and building knowledge about what works the academy provides a focus for all those who share our ambition for uk higher education to provide the best student experience in the world
2303545 iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
2303546 you have to hope that there are reasonable people in iran who see this as not the way to run a country
2303547 they should have felt like time is running out quite a long time ago
2303548 when you are having trouble getting banks to come in getting investment when export credits are going down from around the world when you have inflation roaring time is running out
2303549 all possible sources and modes of spread are being considered
2303550 their decision to voluntarily close while this issue is fully investigated and to minimise any possibility of the infection spreading has been very helpful
2303551 this is a very exciting announcement and shows that the scottish borders is an excellent venue for such world class developments
2303552 we have 69 weddings taking place in and around the gretna district
2303553 they are from all over the uk as well as abroad with exotic locations such as australia south africa even mauritius
2303554 we have two couples from germany we have belgians and spaniards all nationalities
2303555 we saw that the chief executive and elected members had provided a positive response at the corporate level
2303556 the next few months will be crucial in implementing some of the processes which have been slow to develop
2303557 the council has not swerved from its strong commitment to delivering improved social work services to people since the first swia report in 2006
2303558 we have concentrated on getting the right management structure and resources in place to make sure people get the best service we can provide
2303559 we are concerned about this visit because we think it is not the appropriate time to host the iranian president

2303561 in entering into new commitments for public provided financial support for trade with iran notably the granting of export credits guarantees or insurance
2303562 carry out inspections at their airports and maritime ports on cargo going to and from iran
2303563 talks with iaea in the past two days were constructive and the two sides have reached some agreements
2303564 such talks on irans cooperation with iaea will continue in the future
2303565 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2303566 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2303567 no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the
2303568 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2303569 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the
2303570 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2303571 we are ready from this moment to start a dialogue with the iranian government in the presence of an international party
2303572 if the iranian government allows us to enjoy all our political rights we will be ready to abandon arms and enter the political arena
2303573 iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
2303574 have agreed that while informal contacts between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
2303575 i am proud to say that my family and i are shiites
2303576 in court i will defend the bahais two colleagues of mine and i have accepted their case although they were not able to see their families
2303577 they had formed a group and were having contacts with israel and were getting orders from them to act against our interest
2303578 serious concern about the continuing systematic discrimination and harassment of the iranian bahais on the grounds of their religion
2303579 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
2303580 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another
2303581 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved
2303582 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon
2303583 a two three year delay is not worth it for a five to 10 year delay i would say yes
2303584 the two parties will assess the trend of cooperation between and the iaea

2303599 you will be dealing with the smartest man in the middle east in reference to president hafez al assad
2303600 mr assads latest trip to tehran just three weeks after he helped to toast the overthrow of the king of france beside president nicolas sarkozy at the july 14 celebrations in paris seals his place in history without a shot being fired mr assad has ensured anyone who wants anything in the middle east has got to talk to syria hes done nothing and hes won
2303601 israel will have to return the golan heights to syria whether it is now or in five 10 or even 100 years the golan will have to be returned if israel wants to live in peace why not negotiate now and appreciably reduce israels security concerns with its two northern neighbors and free itself to focus on the threat of iran
2303602 my opinion and my goal will be to continue to speak to the syrians without preconditions the way is peace for peace
2303603 as a father who has three children in the military i want peace for them
2303604 we forgot hariri and focused on taking revenge under the slogan of justice and this sequestered the march 14 group into an isolationist position that was a fatal mistake
2303605 we fiercely attacked the syrian regime and forgot our arab discourse
2303606 there is no protection for us the druze and neither honor nor future away from damascus here you are and here is my son taymour you both represent the future of the druze mountain and that of the druze in the region you both can mend what happened all men make mistakes
2303607 i want to make sure that my children grow up in syria with names that keep reminding them of our diverse nation this is syria not saudi arabia
2303608 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
2303609 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
2303610 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
2303611 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
2303612 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
2303613 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
2303614 that is what we were trying to do but it did not work
2303615 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
2303616 their care and custody does not change simply because they are in segregation
2303617 there are concerns that they could be used in places where the detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions it is important to know whether or not detainees are provided with food
2303618 we are able to capture threats to the iraqi government and the population detain them rehabilitate them and 99 times out of 100 release them
2303619 weve made remarkable progress there and i would just say it looks as though the glidepath is on continuing to reduce the population because of the success were having within these camps
2303620 when the sois stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2303621 a lot of them would prefer doing that because it gives them power of carrying a weapon and providing security
2303622 he had a bad background and it finally caught up with him
2303623 as an opportunity to play both sides of the fence usually the guys at checkpoints
2303624 at first there was no open conflict but there was open verbal conflict
2303625 on payday i hand the money over to the national police supervisor and he hands the money to the soi leader and that guy hands the money to soi members
2303626 were gonna continue to pay the soi guys until the government takes over or until they transition into other jobs
2303627 these sons of iraq will eventually go away and now the most important thing is to find jobs for all those individuals
2303628 its just as important providing jobs as it is security
2303629 currently the relations are getting better with the support of coalition forces
2303630 if the coalition forces go back to the states i am afraid i dont know what will happen between those two elements

2303660 due to the increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research in recent months our first concern is for our employees and the animals we care for at
2303661 usda did open an inquiry when we filed a complaint
2303662 their statement about fears for their own safety is absurd
2303663 they have an abysmal record of animal care as usual they are more interested in their reputation than in the animals safety
2303664 that monkeys were literally cooked to death by a heating system failure as a whistleblower alleges shows that the facility did not even have a simple alarm system in place to alert staff to the malfunction
2303665 hanging out at the surface would be a daft strategy for avoiding predators because that is where they can spot your silhouette
2303666 there are no efficient controls to determine whether this testing is justified and whether they cause the animals to suffer
2303667 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2303668 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2303669 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2303670 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2303671 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future

2303679 emc is the only company i have worked for in the u s and i have loved working here since the day i joined growing up in china i have always been a sports fan i love soccer basketball and many other team sports i saw the 2008 beijing olympic games as a unique opportunity for me to contribute back to my beloved home country while creating a benefit for the company at the same time emcs asian circle provided me the perfect platform and an excellent team to turn this opportunity into a reality
2303680 im very happy to become an arsenal player it means such a lot to me this is a very important step in my life as a football player because arsenal is a massive club i really hope everything will go well for me here i will my best for arsenal and its fans and i am honoured to be part of such a great football club
2303681 the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the u n security council to call on russia to reverse course
2303682 theyre currently running a light hearted slice of life photo essay on a hamas terror training camp
2303683 it makes me sick to my stomach that someone actually is trying to glorify these cowards
2303684 w hy is a reputable magazine giving positive propaganda to these ersatz stormtroopers
2303685 then i will come back when they let me out of prison
2303686 on the sunday morning liam got in the front of the van and saw it on the sun visor
2303687 they put it in a container he got it to a friends house and took a picture of it
2303688 then they put it on the internet and identified it and they took it up to the butterfly park
2303689 it wont necessarily be fatal but it certainly is very painful everyones afraid of the black widow
2303690 i was actually reading a bedtime story to my children up in the bedroom and there was a terrific crash bang and all the lights went out
2303691 my wife who was downstairs doing some ironing said that thered been a big flash in the lounge
2303692 so we ran out and basically went into the car in case the house was on fire or whatever
2303693 i know what i want and i am very confident i hope to turn that around in the next two or three weeks the fans should be re assured by what they see
2303694 it would be better to buy someone who has played in england because they are less risky but it costs more money if they are from the premier league maybe i will try to do both
2303695 it doesnt look like we have no team and we have to build a team we were unbeaten at home and that is only the second time in the history of the club we have done that with young players who will be better next season
2303696 if we are winners we come back and do it and that is what i expect from my team i think the big core of the team is ready to come back and fight and that all of them are determined to come back and win
2303697 like every big disappointment you have in life you go through a period where you have to swallow and digest it and think where do i go from here
2303698 rebecca was only 24 with her whole life before her a life in which she planned so many things
2303699 the emptiness i have is unbearable becky meant the world to me
2303700 i am being considered a worthy replacement for henry while not deserving his salary
2303701 yes i am still under contract to arsenal but its up to the directors to satisfy my demands or ill leave if my good form of last season has increased my value my employers have to take account of that
2303702 i had a dream of playing for arsenal and arsenal are one of the loveliest clubs in the world when i go back to africa it is obvious that a lot of people love the club but now i have a chance of playing with one of the biggest clubs in the world
2303703 you have to be reasonable when you get 83 points and you call that failure what would the other teams say
2303704 i feel quality wise we have been remarkable the whole season i have never had a team that has consistently produced quality games like this team we lost a 100 metres race by a fraction of a second we were on the same line and somebody has put their chest in front of us just at the end
2303705 it doesnt mean we have not made a good 100m to have a great 100m you need three or four who compete for the final place
2303706 this year the premier league for maybe the first time in the last four or five years was exciting until the last day of the season and we have contributed to that
2303707 it is respectable 83 points i have won championships with less but it highlights as well the level of the competition the required amount of points needed this year because there was very little difference between the three teams who fought for the championship
2303708 any little weakness and you were punished because manchester united finished with 87 chelsea 85 and we finished with 83
2303709 we now look forward to executing on our strategy and continuing to build our great company yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy in the last year performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
2303710 the company needs to make some fundamental changes if its going to improve its performance and stock price yahoo is too bloated right now they need to reduce head count focus on core businesses and divest some of their holdings that arent making any money
2303711 but its only about the second inning of the company comeback although its been the second inning for a long time there have been a lot of pitches and foul balls
2303712 ive heard our strategy described as spreading peanut butter across the myriad opportunities that continue to evolve in the online world the result a thin layer of investment spread across everything we do and thus we focus on nothing in particular i hate peanut butter we all should
2303713 that came out almost two years ago but its as fresh today as it was back then
2303714 theyve been doing stuff but obviously most of those criticisms are still valid today its going to take a lot of work to get back on track and new leadership and preferably from the outside
2303715 we overplayed our hand with microsoft yes it would have been a great deal for the shareholders and for the company
2303716 we should have taken the deal at 31 per share or about 47 billion in cash obviously they the board disagree with what i think but this doesnt surprise me they think a poison pill is a good idea but i dont think its completely dead i believe microsoft will come back around next year and try again
2303717 i believe it is simply due to microsofts weakness in its online services division you look at their last quarters numbers for that group and its clear that they are falling further behind their desktop business also showed deceleration yahoo helps with both problems
2303718 i had never used microsoft search before a couple of weeks ago i sat down to try it and then realized i had no idea what to type in i tried microsoft com but the only search bar was to help me search msft internal directories i then remembered seeing some advertisement for live search so i tried livesearch com it was some spam site finally i tried live com and the results were no good i will never use it again when i want to google or find yahoo i know what to punch in simple as that
2303719 i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the u s

2303724 the main purpose of the scholarship is we see a lot of girls after high school dont continue their education after high school so we want the girls to use the money for college
2303725 with gas prices at record levels and airlines struggling to survive there is clearly no money from the airlines the federal government or taxpayers to finance this plan if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville
2303726 i implore the court to block all demolition work in bensenville until chicago proves definitively how it will pay for the airport expansion
2303727 decisions this important must be based on the merits of the case not simply on legal technicalities
2303728 this is a ruling on whether or not the children and people of bensenville will be protected from cancer causing toxic materials we will not allow bensenville children to be put in harms way without ensuring every necessary measure is taken to prevent long term health risks
2303729 chicagos claim that it will prevent the spread of toxins into bensenvilles neighborhoods through a process known as water spray is inadequate and without data or testing to back it up
2303730 im 83 years old ive lived here most of my life
2303731 our streets are already becoming desolate and unlivable ive got asthma but im not just worried about myself there are senior centers playgrounds and day care facilities directly in harms way of the toxic chemicals that this demolition will release its unconscionable
2303732 why destroy an entire neighborhood for a project you are never going to build
2303733 even if some magical outside source offered to advance the billions the airlines would have to pay for use of these facilities to pay off the debt
2303734 imposing these massive multi billion dollar costs on airlines in dire financial straits is sheer financial folly
2303735 it really upsets me because we all make dumb mistakes
2303736 but tony was not the only one to do it i really dont want to relive what i had to go through four years ago

2303744 from what ive seen i think its time for you to move on this thing do it
2303745 we need a firmer cost than what we have here
2303746 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2303747 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2303748 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources
2303749 its unique to anybody who ever comes here theyre wowed by it
2303750 anytime you get a divergence of opinion at a community forum where people express their honest opinions its a good thing

2303752 there has been a demonstrated need for a recreational facility in batavia for a long long time

2303759 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten and former white house counsel harriet e miers yesterday asked a federal judge to delay an order to cooperate with congress while they appeal the ruling
2303760 the court filings indicate that bolten and miers will continue to resist subpoenas from the house judiciary committee as the bush administration heads into its final months
2303761 lawmakers are seeking testimony from miers and documents from bolten related to the firings of nine u s attorneys in 2006 after u s district judge john d batess ruling democrats announced they would schedule hearings on the issue in september less than two months before the presidential elections
2303762 bates did not immediately rule on their request the judge asked house lawyers to respond by next week
2303763 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2303764 w e believe that entertaining any requests for mr boltens compliance with the senate judiciary committee subpoena should await a final resolution by the courts in regard to my august 1 2007 letter to mr rove please be advised that consistent with the above the view stated therein remains the position of the administration on the question of immunity for close presidential advisors
2303765 for more than a year karl rove and the presidents chief of staff have hidden behind baseless and unprecedented claims of absolute immunity not to appear in compliance with subpoenas they continue to withhold critical evidence and testimony and to act as if they are above the law because they work at the white house this claim was rejected by judge bates after months of consideration still the white house refuses to appear or cooperate this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law
2303766 it is a form of entertainment that gets local musicians and the community involved in the festival
2303767 she is very well known in town she is everybodys favorite we love her
2303768 we love it when we see people walking into the grounds with children in strollers and older ones walking they come here for the day
2303769 our position is that just because this evidence is not find able at this point does not necessarily mean it gets suppressed
2303770 we can prove its the same blood that was taken from scoliere and was the same blood that was tested we can show we have a tight chain of evidence up to the test
2303771 we dont even know necessarily that that is her blood
2303772 weve lost the opportunity to have our own experts evaluate the sample
2303773 of course our job is to make sure these things all can be prosecuted as successfully as possible
2303774 its just basically human error in my experience the more people involved in these chains of evidence the more opportunity you have for things to go wrong
2303775 critique our practices and suggest ways to improve the way we conduct our business
2303776 it brings with it a little more drama that way theres a little more heart to this than the movie
2303777 i fell in love with the music before ever seeing the show
2303778 he was crazy and wild he was always getting drunk and getting into trouble
2303779 its easy to play a drunk its hard to play the emotional scenes when swann is not drunk
2303780 its fun you get to play with it and have a good time you need to have all your lines down cold
2303781 i want that benjy should bring alan swann home to dinner in brooklyn
2303782 its the first time ive ever done this ive been watching my children all do this for years
2303783 i never realized how much work it is i just thought they were having a good time
2303784 im acting with many other people that have a lot of experience
2303785 the purpose of this event is to bring people out so they can bond with each other have fun and play games
2303786 its an opportunity for the community to come and observe the sikh community while having fun participating in the traditional games of the punjab region of india
2303787 its interesting for the little kids to see how hard it is to go out and play it
2303788 whatever time we can give kids its really worth it
2303789 we all try to bring our culture into our kids so that it stays preserved but on the other hand they also have a choice of american culture so hopefully they pick the best of both cultures
2303790 in order to survive you want your heritage to continue but you live in the western world so you want to know what goes on here too
2303791 it would be really good for american people to come out there and just learn about a different culture
2303792 we started out with the old tube models before televisions evolved into modular systems
2303793 eventually they went to having one chassis with many integrated circuits
2303794 he had many many customers who he serviced for years
2303795 these are serious charges and you have a serious history
2303796 suffice it to say mr evans you are looking at the high end of the sentencing range and a significant period of time if you are found guilty or should plead guilty
2303797 its going to be a big change in his life
2303798 i realized it like a month ago so ive been excited about it since then
2303799 has been talking about her golden birthday since she could read a calendar
2303800 that we realized that this would be a pretty special day
2303801 what i would like people to feel when they see my art is joy hope happiness and most of all to be able to use simple words to have a discussion about art
2303802 i had the opportunity to personally meet romero where we ended up in a conversation about how to bring his art to people across the country
2303803 i see my work as colorful vibrant and very positive and optimistic about the future
2303804 in the course of speaking to her we learned she had been approached by hampton and his girlfriend for acts of prostitution
2303805 now we dont know its just one of those things where you hope for the best but well have to wait and see
2303806 as we have stated all along chicago is fully committed to building the entire program
2303807 popejoys decision moves us one step closer to realizing that goal
2303808 chicago has failed to show how they plan to pay for this misguided billion dollar boondoggle
2303809 if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville
2303810 i am now satisfied by the fact that the environmental protection agencies and other agencies can continue to oversee this project should there be violations of regulations codes or the like
2303811 further delay creates inordinate safety issues pertaining to the existence of vacant unoccupied structures
2303812 a military jury on wednesday found a former driver for osama bin laden guilty of supporting terrorism but not of conspiring in terrorist attacks handing the bush administration a partial victory in the first u s war crimes trial in a half a century
2303813 the verdict reached after about eight hours of deliberations over three days only intensified the debate over whether salim ahmed hamdans conviction was preordained in an unfair system or whether military trials are appropriate for people accused of committing heinous acts against the united states
2303814 the administration seized on the acquittal to defend its military justice system against accusations that it was politicized and drawn up to ensure convictions pentagon and white house officials said they are satisfied with the result
2303815 were pleased that salim hamdan received a fair trial white house spokesman tony fratto said the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees
2303816 ben wizner a lawyer with the american civil liberties union who attended the trial as one of several human rights observers ridiculed the administration for inaugurating the military system on a marginal figure
2303817 we were told that guantanamo was necessary because these were the worlds most dangerous terrorists said wizner who criticized the pentagon for revealing little about u
2303818 the conviction of mr hamdan who was part of a select group of drivers and bodyguards for mr bin laden until 2001 was a long sought if qualified victory for the bush administration which has been working to begin military commission trials here for nearly seven years
2303819 the six senior military officers on the panel deliberated for eight hours over three days four votes in a secret ballot were required for conviction
2303820 critics have long contended that the military commission system does not meet american standards partly because it allows hearsay evidence and evidence derived through coercive interrogation methods
2303821 the concern of the board all along has been trying to preserve as much parking as possible
2303822 its fair to say overall the board is happy with the new design were able to bring a lot more natural light into the building
2303823 they can e mail ahead and well have the materials waiting they wont have to tie up a parking space
2303824 theyre tying it in to the existing building and softening it up its a nice plan
2303825 our ponies were running every which way in the pouring rain but none of them got hurt thank goodness for that
2303826 but in massive power outages like these the last ones without power are always the hardest ones to restore
2303827 we shot over 250 photos to make sure everything was documented
2303828 from what we can determine the tornado hit the front of the dome and actually lifted the front of the dome at the base
2303829 and the rest kind of deflated from there the staff were huddled on site by the driving range and they could hear the trees coming and the dome ripping
2303830 our main focus is working overtime to pick up debris
2303831 thats probably going to be consuming public works for the next few weeks
2303832 the community really opens its arms to having athletes there which is nice
2303833 its an exciting event just to see people of all ages competing in the triathlon out there biking and swimming for a couple hours
2303834 it just gives athletes of all abilities a chance to participate in this type of race
2303835 there is only so much we can do about it
2303836 she moved in after the trucking company was there and she knew the trucks run at night
2303837 just having these prominent people from all over the world in our little town is amazing
2303838 its never a bad thing to be in a pennant race and have help walk through the door its not going to hurt when guys know theres another weapon that they can use
2303839 duaner sanchez his velocity is down 3 6 mph from 06 sanchez is under team control through 09 scott schoeneweis his strikeout rate is down but so is his era apparently no team wanted to risk taking on his contract 3 6mm this year 3 6mm in 09
2303840 acquired chad bradford from the orioles for a player to be named later i guess it was an expensive price for the twins to pay
2303841 the twins got plenty from the rockies 1 6 million of salary they dont have to pay
2303842 on the surface bradford looks to be a nice addition but we dont know the details surrounding the transaction do we
2303843 its amazing to see all of these players the twins should have so obviously gone after becoming so obvious only after somebody else has gone after them
2303844 can williams frozen head catch a pop up in the of
2303845 this time of year the reason for a player to be named later is often because even if the player is agreed on they have to get that player through waivers
2303846 how would you like to be a rockie fan and the big move is to bring in livan to help out in the race
2303847 why believe the twins intend on making any waiver trades they show no inclination to do so
2303848 but given how things have not happened to date why believe the twins intend on making any waiver trades they show no inclination to do so
2303849 why believe the twins intend on making any waiver trades they show no inclination to do so
2303850 that would mean there are a lot of pitchers who fall into that category including joe nathan
2303851 running that youth out there every night without reservation is way more ballsy than most gms in mlb could ever be
2303852 that would mean there are a lot of pitchers who fall into that category including joe nathan
2303853 if bradford were joe nathan that probably wouldnt matter but he isnt
2303854 there are two rules to a ptbnl transaction the deal must close within a six month time frame following the conclusion of the rest of the trade and the player must change leagues
2303855 there are only two rules regarding ptbnls 1 the deal must close within 6 months and 2 the ptbnl must change leagues so it cant be someone off the 25 man roster
2303856 the twins had targets in mind in atkins kouz roberts grudzy and beltre when they couldnt make those deals work they did what was best and didnt settle
2303857 so apologist how the hell do you know that the pohlads care nothing about winning
2303858 how the hell do you know that the pohlads care nothing about winning
2303859 as long as the seats are filled and they have been nothing else really matters
2303860 the dramatic drop in salary has nothing to do with the fact that 90 of this roster is in the early stages of their career or anything
2303861 the beermen the ushers the parking lot attendants and the ballgirls all want their team to win unless they had allegiances to other teams earlier in life
2303862 if the decision is losing and making money or breaking even or winning but losing money
2303863 if he goes back to starting then go to a six man rotation everyone else is young and not used to pitching a full season in the bigs so they should be able to go about one inning longer in the game which will save on the pen
2303864 maybe its because unlike yourself i actually pay attention to the sports reports both locally and nationally
2303865 for the last time ellsbury and lester were never in the same deal it was only covered like everyday for three months
2303866 remember people we dont know who was offered to the twins for santana
2303867 put yourself in their position and tell me that filling the seats is all thats important
2303868 ok give mxe pohlads bank account and ill gladly tell you that he doesnt give a shit about winning
2303869 the fact remains that he gomez can bunt for a hit whenever he wants
2303870 bass is in there because gardy decided that was his best option given the other pitchers available the reason bass was his best option was partly because other better pitchers had already been worked
2303871 if you get rid of bass and replace him with a guy who pitches even fewer innings then those other guys who werent available because they had been over worked already need to pitch even more innings
2303872 pohlad flat out stated that the team wasnt worth his
2303873 after the july 31 deadline any player on a 40 man roster must clear major league waivers before being traded that is the player must be offered to the other teams in reverse order of the standings if he is claimed by any club the club that made the waiver request can either withdraw the request and keep the player or let the player go to the claiming team which would then have the rights to the player and be obligated to that players current contract a waiver which is a permission granted for certain assignments of player contracts can get complicated if more than one team makes a waiver claim if more than one club in the same league makes a claim then the club currently lower in the standings gets the player if clubs in both leagues claim the player preference goes to the club in the same league as the club requesting waivers
2303874 well let you have him if you give us player x
2303875 remember people we dont know who was offered to the twins for santana
2303876 if everyone who thinks the pohlad family is infatuated with their money is a parasite then this state is full of parasites guess grow up and get a clue
2303877 brian bass is unwatchable breslows a chick reyes eats bad chicks is there any young stud in aa or aaa who can bring it were close
2303878 he was not the best bullpen arm at ft myers when he got called up to new britain anthony slama was if anyone in the minors could help the bullpen i think itd be a guy like philip humber who did fantastic in his brief stint as a reliever for rochester before gaining his rotation spot back or kevin mulvey who has been pitching well recently
2303879 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him
2303880 but the pictures after he was apprehended with the glasses those look just like him
2303881 we have been informed about the case by the u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany at the moment
2303882 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2303883 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2303884 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2303885 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2303886 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
2303887 we just figured out everything was not what it was
2303888 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
2303889 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2303890 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2303891 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
2303892 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2303893 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2303894 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2303895 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2303896 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2303897 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2303898 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a
2303899 being on a database that can be exchanged throughout the world or hacked into
2303900 the hammerschmidt mansion is one of the first impressions visitors receive of our community and not only is it a visual treasure but one of the only remaining queen anne homes along chicago avenue
2303901 it is not simply a residence but a work of art a show piece of a bygone era and a visual focal point for the area
2303902 they have made it public and very much aware out there that they are prepared to sell the property to anybody who is willing to purchase it with landmark status for their purchase price and their closing costs and caring costs
2303903 its unfortunate that a few people are trying to impose their will on someone else the property today is beyond maintenance and it would take close to 1 million to put this property back in a condition that would be acceptable
2303904 anyone that has lived in naperville more than a year or two knows this home if there was ever a landmark home in town this has to be at the top or near it
2303905 this is a very low cost way for a homeowner to solve water problems and at the same time do some enhanced landscaping
2303906 finding contractors can even be difficult since the project is on such a small scale
2303907 counsels request for a new trial date is a very legitimate request
2303908 i frankly dont understand how it can be how delivery of documents takes place so close to trial
2303909 this is impressive and obviously there was a lot of community involvement
2303910 it is a unique project compared to what we have seen there are not a lot of memorial parks usually they are ball parks or concession stands
2303911 there was a lot of community involvement and community spirit in this memorial
2303912 to even get a site visit and knowing they took a look at our application and sent judges from southern illinois is enough for us
2303913 were not wholly against the ordinances at all and were certainly not trying to delay it
2303914 we just have concerns that the language now is overly harsh and provides too little latitude to property owners
2303915 theyre telling us that theyre not interested in revoking everyones license on the first call and that the language is there so that it has teeth
2303916 well we think they should either enforce it how its written or change the language to reflect what theyre telling us because folks are getting scared
2303917 if theres one bad tenant in a 100 unit complex and the owner loses his license do the good people in the other 99 units have to find a new home or will they only restrict the owners license to rent that one unit for a year
2303918 when the story was in about the fresh foods suit we got an e mail from a resident saying thats nice but what about the shell station
2303919 on numerous occasions village officials have met with individuals interested in the property and have offered assistance in finding new businesses to occupy the space including other oil companies however the property has remained vacant and boarded up
2303920 unfortunately house speaker mike madigan has decided to oppose every initiative we propose
2303921 what are you supposed to do to do right by the people
2303922 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try and take away health care from people
2303923 now the governor by doing this risks us not getting anything at all
2303924 many of us are getting sick and tired of this little game it is hurting people
2303925 get to work stop making excuses and earn your pay
2303926 we dont all have to do it the same we dont have to all be in service at the same time we do need to stand together for the things we do agree upon
2303927 i shared my faith vision and they said were going to walk this faith journey with you
2303928 after 100 days in the hospital and three surgeries i promised god i was going to fulfill my lifes mission to create more disciples of christ
2303929 it wasnt the demographics or anything like that it was just a strong sense through the lord
2303930 its just where all of the opportunities and the doors have opened
2303931 weve been sent to the area to not do something new but to build on all the great christian history thats already in the area
2303932 i want to be one of the agents that will bring all of the christian churches in lombard together because we are so much more powerful together than we are apart
2303933 it was so hot the guys could only get about 5 feet inside before they had to pull back
2303934 we switched from carrying hoses in to surrounding the structure with the rigs and dousing it with water
2303935 many of the apartment units on the first floor had smoke and water damage
2303936 i really dont know how expensive the damage was what does an apartment complex cost
2303937 the maximum sentence can bring back some security for my family
2303938 im not going to say youre a monster but this is a long time coming
2303939 i can never truly forget at least now my family we can try and get on and leave it behind us
2303940 he has no remorse at all for what he did
2303941 he was a wife beater who couldnt control me anymore because i had left i started a new life married a new person and he couldnt stand not being able to control and dominate me
2303942 to us its like hes dead because we will never have to deal with him again
2303943 wir haben uns sehr ber die erneute zusammenarbeit mit dem zdf gefreut und bei der erstellung des technischen konzeptes sowie beim design und der entwicklung der anwendung kreativit t mit erfahrung kombiniert
2303944 im ergebnis nimmt der besucher die intuitive bedienung und das design direkt wahr das intelligente preloading und die modulare strukturierte programmierung spielen sich hingegen im hintergrund ab und werden h chstens dadurch wahrgenommen dass das olympia special 2008 schnell und reibungslos funktioniert
2303945 isnt it nice to say you have done so much for gurnee that we should honor you at the start of gurnee days
2303946 they see what we have and show up with friends neighbors and family
2303947 i thought you know i love the 50s everything people did it was new it just seemed like such an innovative time
2303948 this is a whole new batch of kids who havent experienced the 50s
2303949 this is the first big musical ive done with them every day i learn something new from them
2303950 ive taken several of their ideas and put them into the show i encourage their ideas one of the things i love i can act goofy with them and get them to laugh and they make me laugh as well
2303951 we have cause to believe that this was a human smuggling operation and so the people involved were illegally in the united states
2303952 the smuggler doesnt care if their cargo lives or dies
2303953 the sheriff has to run the jail in an orderly fashion if every judge starts ordering as many hours as a defendants requests its going to be problematic
2303954 you need to be detailed and finite and say heres what im going to do for the 8th district
2303955 she has advocated for a comprehensive policy that includes fuel efficiency energy conservation and an expansion of domestic energy options including nuclear wind solar domestic oil production clean coal and renewable fuels
2303956 if youre going to drill drill where you have the ability to drill instead of looking for it
2303957 if we cant manage to protect this kid she will be killed
2303958 our work with young victims would benefit from a constant policy to avoid the situation you just heard about
2303959 it took me a while to comprehend what i was seeing
2303960 there was a big bear chewing on the feeder and busting up the plastic i was just in shock really
2303961 theyre hitting garbage cans and bird feeders looking for something to eat
2303962 for most of the planned residents they probably didnt have a greenhouse on their own how wonderful would that be
2303963 somebody with money doesnt want to live with somebody without
2303964 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2303965 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2303966 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2303967 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2303968 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2303969 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2303970 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2303971 it all started about seven years ago when my generation of friends went to a village hall meeting and persuaded the members of the board to build the skate park
2303972 after a couple years i noticed the people who used to attend the skate park were not going as much anymore thats when i realized we not only had to create an effort to bring back the skaters but create something to engage the community
2303973 the competition gives skateboarders in the area something to look forward to
2303974 its a great opportunity for those who have signed up to practice their skills and show off some new tricks and their talents
2303975 we will be judging on style quantity of tricks and technique
2303976 we are going to treat everyone equal that means we are going to root for the beginners just as much as the experts
2303977 we will have first second and third prizes for skateboarders per each division of beginners intermediates and experts
2303978 if a skateboarders second run is not as good as their first run we will judge the better score
2303979 we want people to realize that skateboarding is a sport and it takes a lot of hard work and practice for competitions like the one we are hosting
2303980 we hope to change a few perspectives and bring a more skate orientated environment into antioch
2303981 for any knox person around in the 50s there was this overwhelming feeling you had heading towards old main from standish park
2303982 it was not just a line of beautiful big trees in the spring and summer there was this feeling you were walking underneath a kind of tunnel thats how dramatic it was
2303983 how to help the family when chronic mental illness paralyzes the entire family

2303985 given half a chance the schott 50 state report on public education for black males
2303986 we feel that the use of these mobile classrooms segregate our children from the general student body
2303987 we want to know how socioeconomic backgrounds are affecting education
2303988 durch die neustrukturierung der firma in die bereiche agency solutions und labs ist es uns gelungen raum f r wachstum zu schaffen

2303990 f r die umsetzung unserer anspruchsvollen projekte ben tigen wir st ndig guten nachwuchs an erstklassigen programmierern
2303991 if prices are favorable the fire department board of trustees will want to move forward immediately
2303992 weve known for a while that we need a satellite to better serve the high population in prestbury
2303993 we want a response time no longer than six minutes weve had some responses in those areas that took longer than six minutes
2303994 well have a geothermal system that takes cool air from underground during the summer and warm air during the winter well also have a cistern that will collect rain water off the roof to use for fighting fires and to wash the trucks
2303995 it would allow us to go after drivers that are way over the speed limit
2303996 it is not like some guy going 7 or 10 miles over
2303997 i just want people to know that i didnt kill my friend
2303998 i was scared to death i was charged with a murder i didnt do
2303999 i said what do you mean this is a bad idea
2304000 i told 911 that i was charged with murder and i was following the car of the man who had been killed
2304001 the evidence initially pointed to powell the more we collected it pointed to jones
2304002 isnt it funny that donald powell just got out of jail and he stumbles across that car
2304003 i smell a rat we had cars all over jefferson county looking for allens car we had airplanes in the sky looking for it and donald powell finds it
2304004 ive never seen anything like this in my 40 years
2304005 this is the first time ive seen someone charged with murder help solve the case i know the odds of that happening are high but just because someone is charged it doesnt mean he is guilty
2304006 we of course have to prepare our sentence recommendation consistent with what the jury found
2304007 history and world opinion will judge whether the government proved the system to be fair
2304008 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2304009 we had a few trees come down not many power issues
2304010 we were able to clean it up the next day and it was not nearly as bad as some other storms weve had before
2304011 most of the remaining outages dont affect large number of customers
2304012 the extra crews help us get to small pockets of customers
2304013 theres a lot of interest out there so we can be really picky
2304014 theyve said most new theaters are maxing out at 14 screens
2304015 they feel that thats the saturation point unless they put out a new batman movie every weekend
2304016 i just think of the rosemont area as being on an island
2304017 some people are scaling back on spending so why would people travel to this muvico theater as much as i love the concept i will not use it on a regular basis
2304018 we had a really good dialogue but we were looking for a bigger turnout
2304019 whether the land would even be made available in the other plans is a drawback
2304020 i could be sitting here three or four years from now talking about a possible recreation center
2304021 thats why if and when this goes to referendum everyone will have their say on whether they think this is right for batavia or not
2304022 were doing what we can to find out what happened to it it doesnt appear that there was anything done purposefully
2304023 we have our own issues with the blood but were adding the fact that they didnt preserve the evidence as a reason the blood should not be admissible at trial
2304024 in this case there are multiple issues with the blood draw not the least of which is it has gone missing
2304025 no we didnt have a van thats why we laughed the next day when we found out that they were saying it was a van
2304026 mr sarno says mr sarno mr salerno thats a slip there
2304027 i have not heard one bit of evidence that someone gave an order from the chicago outfit
2304028 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2304029 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2304030 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2304031 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
2304032 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
2304033 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2304034 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
2304035 i think that the test that winnifred has to pass is quite comical twenty mattresses and a pea imagine that definitely not the typical physical or mental test
2304036 it is every girls dream to be a princess winnifred teaches us to always be true to ourselves and to never forget where we come from because in the long run anyone can achieve their dreams
2304037 i seem to always play the controlling mean possessive and hated person of the show my inspiration comes from past roles and then i just play around with the role until i get it right
2304038 we have been having so much fun preparing this production that it hardly seems like work
2304039 seeing live theater is a wonderful opportunity to spend time with your family everyone who attends a performance will be impressed with the quality of work this group has attained i am delighted to watch our performers develop new talents hone technique and make amazing choices which truly is the motivation behind my direction
2304040 in 1988 we created a plan for the library and said it was for 20 years
2304041 were slowly finishing what i would call the total plans
2304042 the architect and our director have been meeting with the city and the historic preservation commission then well have focus groups soon with citizens then weve just got to set a timeline
2304043 the new library will have whatever it takes to have a no 1 library
2304044 one of the things that made me think of japan as a paradise though im sure they have their own issues is the civility with which they treat each other
2304045 it was a big mistake it wasnt my fault i pushed the girl in the chest area while she was grabbing for a glass in my hand
2304046 i liked the stainless steel material he used i think that is very interesting
2304047 this contract will allow the deputies to see their job as a profession

2304054 connecting kids to the natural world is what were all about
2304055 all of our programs are based on the motto through education understanding through understanding appreciation through appreciation protection
2304056 we dont know why they exited then re entered from another window
2304057 but we do know they used a cart inside the school to help them remove the laptops
2304058 we are still trying to pin down exactly what happened with that hook up
2304059 its operating now but we dont know why it malfunctioned over the weekend
2304060 the school was insured so the computers will be replaced by the insurance company minus the deductible of course but its just a shame that this happened
2304061 here we are trying to create a wonderful learning environment for children and someone does this its disheartening
2304062 she would come home from school and would immediately take off her braces and crawl around on the floor
2304063 its a pretty unusual wish and i dont think weve had others like it in illinois
2304064 she could have chosen to go to a hannah montana concert or take a trip to disney or something and she would have been happy for a night or one week
2304065 this is something that was going to benefit her forever
2304066 shes made great gains and shes one of those kids who really wanted to stay and do more
2304067 when i started i did not think i could take 100 steps
2304068 she can go on the swing climb up the ladder slide down the slide everything we do
2304069 shes in therapy for four hours we get home and even we are exhausted but she still wants to keep going and asks to go on the treadmill
2304070 shes a little workhorse she sees the progress and wants to keep it up

2304077 algunas publicaciones period sticas ventilaron el d a de ayer que era posible que la administraci n de la udla en particular el rector pedro ngel palou estuviera molesto por la postura cr tica del peri dico universitario hacia su relaci n con el gobernador del estado mario mar n y la invitaci n que ste hab a recibido para acudir al informe de labores del escritor en la udla
2304078 seg n esas versiones lo que habr a perturbado a las autoridades universitarias fue una caricatura en la que el intelectual palou y el gobernador mario mar n torres jugaban cartas sentados en una mesa rodeados por animales
2304079 mike saw the enthusiasm in our business leaders and knew it was time for a chamber to be born
2304080 throughout the years the chamber hosted numerous programs published a newsletter and promoted its members as well as offering educational opportunities
2304081 this is all pretty heady stuff for a girl from the northwest side of chicago
2304082 volunteering for the 30th anniversary committee was a life changing event for me and allowed me to meet people and learn things that were not in my realm before it
2304083 just because it is the budget doesnt mean we are going to spend every dollar
2304084 this was an extremely well thought out and efficient planning process were putting in what we need its not extravagant
2304085 we are going to borrow just what we need now and avoid paying interest on the rest for a year
2304086 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2304087 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2304088 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2304089 theyve got about seven days to have fun with their hair

2304102 we need to be able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to bring charges
2304103 with tick bourne illnesses they can happen anywhere at anytime
2304104 this can happen in your own backyard which apparently happened to this individual
2304105 the surgery was successful and went well if not better than expected
2304106 but because of the severity of the injuries it will not be a quick turnaround in any event
2304107 one of the best things about it was we didnt have to drive we went with a group of about 10 in a limousine that left from the marklund campus in geneva
2304108 we had trouble getting volunteers last year so we outsourced the work and that cost us part of the proceeds
2304109 this year we started recruiting in february we have more knowledge now about making it work better
2304110 nej inte god ta gud skynda han vinner nej vi leder h ckelapa me
2304111 we had a bit of a run at it last year but we couldnt quite make it
2304112 well have another shot at it this year as will a few other clubs but it will be difficult
2304113 i think a lot of clubs have made a bit of a statement with some of the signings the likes of tottenham and portsmouth have made some good additions
2304114 aston villa have such a young squad and theyll probably improve year on year

2304120 the community support for the kermes has been fantastic with high attendance each year
2304121 we work very hard to make the kermes affordable for everyone
2304122 the event is inclusive and people from all over lake county are welcome to participate
2304123 we want that the tibetans should stop protesting taking into consideration the long lasting relations of friendship with china
2304124 we wont let the event take place we dont need such a thing in the new federal democratic republic of nepal where women are treated as objects of entertainment
2304125 such contests send the wrong message to society as they emphasise physical beauty rather than intellectual ability
2304126 the event was originally scheduled for 7 august but we have postponed it for the time being
2304127 we are currently in the process of holding dialogue with them so the contest has only been postponed for some time
2304128 just going to san diego for the weekend to check out the beaches

2304131 all too often i see golfers end up taking pain killers or having to stop playing all together just because of back pain from golf recently chiropractic treatment has really caught on as an excellent way to alleviate those on the green pains
2304132 the problems occur from all those repetitive golf swings since chiropractic is the science of the spine we are in a good position to help golfers understand the correct way to take care of their bodies while still enjoying lots of golf
2304133 its my goal to educate golfers that chiropractic can really benefit them and keep them playing pain free
2304134 not only can chiropractors most effectively treat acute and chronic back injuries caused by golf but can also help them prevent injuries some important things they should be doing are stretching before and after golfing keeping hydrated shortening your back swing and using correct posture and stance
2304135 this way they can see how chiropractic might enhance their golf game
2304136 one of my men was killed on the spot when the taleban attacked us while four went missing the rest of us laid down our arms and were captured

2304143 we are talking of millions of people old and young rich and middle class low budget and high budget this is a huge market and everyone wants a finger in the pie
2304144 if we really want to reconstitute ourselves as a nation we have to freely mingle with other nations so travel whenever you can
2304145 mostly domestic tourists so far bengalis are turning to foreign travel in a big way
2304146 these places are nearer to calcutta and so work out cheaper for bengalis than for others in india in some case a package to thailand is less expensive from calcutta than a package to kerala or kashmir
2304147 we live in a high rise apartment and egypt was a consensus destination when we discussed our travel plans in the apartment club
2304148 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2304149 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2304150 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
2304151 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
2304152 the government says theyre going to take five cents from us for every gallon of gas fine well just jack up the price of gas five cents to cover it
2304153 have the government take more money from people making money

2304431 it is a sad fate for a man to die well known to others but unknown to himself
2304432 purpose is the place where your hearts deepest gladness and the worlds greatest need intersect
2304433 to the extent that people can become clear about the purpose of their lives the mission they believe they have been placed on this earth to accomplish and the values they hold close to their hearts they will have more fulfilling experiences especially if theyre able to connect those values and goals to their roles at work
2304434 where the spirit does not work with the hand there is no art
2304435 i think people naturally love to affiliate and prefer working together but then we put them in organizations and in this highly competitive american culture where people learn to pit themselves against each other

2304467 we began the search at 8 30am on sunday around the area where a rucksack belonging to the man was found
2304468 crews searched the main gully on the east face of tryfan where the body was found beneath heather and bracken
2304469 while we were satisfied that people were brought to account for their greedy deception the real loser here was the vulnerable victim who had been stripped of money she spent all her life saving up
2304470 people often forget one of the most traditional duties of a police officer we do not stop when thieves have been convicted the job is only done when victims get back what is rightfully theirs
2304471 it is greatly satisfying for me and the team that our hard work has paid off for such a deserving person
2304472 the victim in this case has always acted in good grace and with patience she reached the point where she accepted her loss when it would have been understandable to bear a grudge
2304473 she has had the opportunity to speak at will about those who conned her but has kept a dignified silence throughout
2304474 we are grateful for the care consideration and thoughtfulness that we experienced during the investigation and subsequent trial and conviction of these embezzlers
2304475 there was unexpected relief at the very good news that all of the money embezzled plus interest was to be repaid
2304476 we are profoundly disappointed that the relevant councils did not take the opportunity to approve our original scheme as they have a lead responsibility in the fight against climate change
2304477 the negative impacts of the proposal were very limited and the potential benefits were considerable whats so difficult to decide
2304478 as a result we have appealed for non determination on the original application but we thought it would be helpful to make a further application with a modified scheme that they may find more acceptable
2304479 this gives the councils and the public the opportunity to take a positive step in supporting measures that should lead to a decarbonised economy
2304480 we are convinced that this is a reflection of coronation power accepting that their original submission was poor in almost every respect and that they had not done the required amount of work to understand the environmental ramifications of the proposed development
2304481 the full details of the new plans have not been made clear to us but we are convinced that a reduction in the size and overall number of turbines will have little beneficial effect in mitigating the negative impact
2304482 we are very disappointed that coronation power has descended to such tactics as re submitting another but similar application when the democratic process has already resulted in formal rejection of the original plans by the local authorities concerned

2304554 we do not think that the amount of leakage would have any impact on humans or the environment
2304555 the united states assures strict procedures and prevention systems for nuclear powered warships coming into port and japan is also checking the radiation levels 24 hours a day
2304556 it is a time when we must be extra careful about safety and we should not draw easy conclusions
2304557 we have already instructed all airlines flying between japan and
2304558 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2304559 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2304560 this goes to show the people of japan and the government of japan that they can be reassured that the will be forthright in disclosing details about any inadvertent release of radioactivity even when it is extremely small

2304625 and unfortunately people become disappointed when it doesnt come to fruition but part of that is because it was preliminary findings and then when there are more mature findings or when its analyzed a different way with a larger sample size it really didnt come out to those same findings
2304626 i was surprised that of the scientific communications that companies give out that about 60 per cent of them are based on findings from abstracts
2304627 so the majority of the findings of the press releases are related to preliminary findings that arent fully peer reviewed
2304628 about a fifth of those they didnt really say where they got their data they just said findings of a study it was a real sherlock holmes type of enterprise to try and track down where this study came from or was this original data was this abstract data or was it presented at a meeting
2304629 but really they didnt talk about the study limitations and the idea that this is preliminary studies or preliminary data almost universally this was not discussed
2304630 they often talk about adverse events or harms in this study similar to what they would do with commercials on tv where they list a variety of adverse events or side effects or harms
2304631 however we can clearly state that as the community that develops medicines and vaccines that improve and save lives our members are committed to accuracy and transparency in all public communications
2304632 recognizing the space limitations of a press release and the complexity of the research and development of new medicines and vaccines other sources are readily available and accessible to journalists seeking further information including websites and contacts
2304633 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on energy lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2304634 companies need to ask will it be productive does it really add value to our bottom line

2304640 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2304641 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2304642 cell phones which are being manufactured by a variety of makers could be delayed beyond the current expected release in late 2008

2304670 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2304671 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this had been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2304672 every wanna be watergate journalist in the northern hemisphere e mails me with conspiracy theories
2304673 to be with these other athletes who are on the cover with me now i can cheer and watch them at the beard the youngest u s swimmer to ever bring home the gold after her performance at the 1996 games in atlanta was also playing nintendo olympics game with the power pad where you started out as the turtle and worked your way up to the cheetah
2304674 my family would have competitions against other families who were close friends and wed rock it wed do the triple jump and the hurdles and all of that fun stuff
2304675 like every guy its a major part of my life especially when you travel overseas
2304676 video games pass the time so much easier than just playing cards
2304677 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2304678 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2304679 for me it keeps me off my feet it keeps me engaged and i dont waste a lot of energy playing them
2304680 maybe some young kid will play the game and be inspired to go out and train in real life with the goal of really being in the some day
2304681 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
2304682 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2304683 more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
2304684 it was a miscalculation without exception technology companies have botched launches
2304685 why were they able to get itunes right but not this were they just stretched too thin
2304686 maybe they were a little bit too cocky about this it made logical sense to launch mobileme at the same time as the iphone
2304687 the cash dividend for the dow is 322 40 one year ago the dividend was 284 06 amidst all the turmoil in the markets and the economy something must be going right with the dow 30 companies because the dividend is ever climbing
2304688 dividends as we all know can only come from the reality of earnings you cant pay what you dont have the dividend yield on the dow is currently 2 66 which represents an 11 downside to a 3 0 yield and the historically repetitive area of undervalue
2304689 will the average make it down to that level no one knows but that isnt the point at current levels the upside is far greater particularly in many of the stocks in our undervalued area
2304690 fellow value lover and famed contrarian david dreman cited recently that there have been 12 panics and recoveries since world war ii
2304691 what his studies showed was that after the markets hit their lows they were up 36 6 a year on average afterwards and there wasnt one year that was negative two years after the panic lows the market as judged by the dow industrials was up 53 on average
2304692 based on the current dow dividend of 318 41 a 53 advance would still fall below the current overvalue area of dow 21 227 based on a dividend yield of 1 50
2304693 pie in the sky you say maybe but over the long term it is hard to bet against capitalism and the markets in other words this too shall pass
2304694 meanwhile the good news is that the retracement on the industrials has created another opportunity to acquire some outstanding stocks that i suggest we will hold for quite some time
2304695 our current timely ten consists of undervalued stocks that generally have a s amp p dividend amp earnings quality rating of a or better and a designation for exemplary long term dividend growth
2304696 these stocks also offer a p e ratio of 15 or less a payout ratio of 50 or less 75 for utilities debt of 50 or less 75 for utilities and technical characteristics on the daily and weekly charts that suggests the potential for imminent capital appreciation
2304697 it is our reasoned expectation based on our methodology and experience for what we believe will perform best over the next five years

2304774 we have beaten them a number of times in the past but not now
2304775 i thought it was hilarious that we had not thrown a touchdown pass in a passing league
2304776 it isnt always pretty but he has a knack of making plays
2304777 to a certain degree i do not know what im getting into
2304778 im a south mississippi boy i know how tough it can be and i know how great it can be in new york city
2304779 am i ready to face it handle it and deal with it i think so
2304780 i think it is a great opportunity green bay is a small market but is there a bigger team
2304781 ive been in front of a lot of media ive been in big games ive won big games ive lost big games and ive had my share of criticism and glory im here for one reason and that is to help the jets win
2304782 i think all parties involved felt this was the best result for a difficult situation
2304783 we have accomplished a lot of great things with chad
2304784 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2304785 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2304786 this off season has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2304787 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2304788 it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and close it out
2304789 it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
2304790 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call
2304791 as a running back you want the load on your shoulders
2304792 they throw a lot at you we had three rookie offensive lineman and they definitely held their ground tonight
2304793 i know me personally i have a lot of confidence in the guys that play so im not using that as an excuse at all
2304794 it was good that we were able to stay poised
2304795 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around
2304796 i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter
2304797 its primary purpose is to inform discussions and debates because frankly there has been a lot of rubbish about who can claim sovereignty over what
2304798 to be honest most of the other maps that i have seen in the media have been very simple
2304799 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
2304800 all coastal states have rights over the resources up to 200 nautical miles from their coastline
2304801 so we used specialist geographical software to buffer the claims out accurately
2304802 energy security is driving interest as is the fact that arctic ice is melting more and more during the summer

2304806 these groups do not want equality among fellow bolivians they do not respect the identity and diversity of our people and our biggest concern is that some of these small groups talk about independence and separatism using autonomy as an excuse
2304807 there are over 20 000 tienditas or little shops throughout the city where people can buy drugs
2304808 its like a tsunami spreading from the border down to the south of mexico
2304809 tijuana has an estimated 200 000 drug addicts the highest level of drug addiction in mexico
2304810 i have seen as much as a 300 increase in the number of children coming to our centre for treatment
2304811 its in the interest of the drug dealers to get these kids hooked on drugs early
2304812 the drug pushers use kids to sell drugs on the streets because they dont draw as much attention from the police
2304813 i was selling drugs not for profit but simply so that i could afford the drugs i needed
2304814 i was exposed to shoot outs because there would be conflicts with other dealers over turf i was also asked to hide weapons for the man i worked for
2304815 what kind of kids can we expect to raise with this kind of violence
2304816 but the real solution is going to require a change in the way we live here in mexico a greater understanding of our reality a change in the way we think
2304817 we want people to understand how important it is for them to think about home health care the same way they think about choosing a doctor or a hospital
2304818 but we also want to provide them with the critical information necessary to make a good decision about a home health care provider for themselves and their loved ones
2304819 our research demonstrated what many in the industry already suspected anecdotally that most people don
2304820 the challenge for us was to get consumers to understand that they actually had a choice and tell them why vnsny was the right choice to make
2304821 not surprisingly this is a category where the advertising has been very quiet and traditional
2304822 we wanted to make it more real world more immediate to get people thinking about the issues

2305003 to the casual observer the non superhero reading public theres not much to distinguish marvel from dc
2305004 and dc of 2008 is the the democratic party of 2004
2305005 what should be an appealing package of standard comic book ideas is being drowned out in a wicked combination of mediocre product and deafening internet chatter
2305006 dcs event comics should be able to be summarized in a single sentence
2305007 this isnt to dismiss disgruntled fans when dc does make a mistake countdown was an egregious miscalculation and im still waiting for a substantial apology but picking on dc has become so commonplace its a wonder if theres any signal to noise at this point that its a genuine question whether the hapless dc staffers who bother to read this stuff can actually glean any useful information
2305008 i confess to being a bit flabbergasted by the first criticism of
2305009 trust us this isnt like all of the other times
2305010 a lot of these criticisms also appeared during the first issue of the series which was more or less prologue to the main action of the series perhaps morrison should have turned up the heat for the first issue but this reader cant help buy wonder if those other reviewers were jumping to conclusions about a comic which they hadnt seen to even partial completion how would any work in any other medium stand up to criticism if the reviewer wrote their review based upon the first few minutes
2305011 to some degree final crisis is taking more than its fair share of lumps because of the horrendous transition between

2305016 michael on the other hand is happiest when he is in a different hemisphere from the rest of his family
2305017 as he gets closer to the truth michael scrapes by helping out whoever needs his services mostly desperate people who cant go to the police using his special ops training some duct tape and his sardonic humor michael becomes a reluctant hero its a dangerous gig but its the best he can do for now

2305023 from its founding in 1975 microsoft has become the worlds largest software company with offices in over 100 countries its windows operating system which runs on 90 of all pcs currently in use and for the windows office applications utilized by over 400 million users
2305024 this firm is extremely profitable with company wide operating margins in excess of 40 the windows operating system and office productivity suite have operating margins averaging closer to 70
2305025 the company is completely debt free and generates over 1 billion in free cash flow each month management has done an excellent job of utilizing shareholder capital with a return on equity of over 40 compared to an average of 15 for s amp p 500 companies
2305026 additionally the companys global presence with two thirds of revenue generated outside the united states helps to mitigate the effects of a domestic recession the companys enviable profitability and lack of debt produce a very strong balance sheet
2305027 even after paying a 32 billion special dividend in 2004 and buying back 47 billion worth of stock over the past two years microsoft still holds 31 billion in cash and long term investments
2305028 microsoft retains over 75 of earnings but it initiated a dividend in 2004 and has increased the dividend each year although the stock currently yields just 1 5 this is high relative to its peers
2305029 identifying a great company for investment is only half the process our goal is to purchase the stock at a discount to fair value microsofts valuation metrics including price cash flow price revenue and price earnings are all at their lowest levels of the past 20 years
2305030 in fact although the stock price remains the same as in late 2002 the companys sales have doubled and earnings have increased 50 during this time frame at the current price microsoft offers a great opportunity to buy an excellent company at historically low valuation levels
2305031 while there is much to like about microsoft there are obviously business risks perhaps the biggest challenge is the firms need to adapt to the developing software as a service segment of the industry
2305032 with this business strategy software is delivered on demand via the internet and paid for by subscription traditional licenses or even provided free of charge and funded by online advertising
2305033 this is one reason why online advertising is so important to the microsoft business model moving forward and why they tried to acquire yahoo
2305034 while such an agreement would likely be dilutive to earnings in the short term the fact that microsoft has such a strong financial position and can afford these investments represents a distinct competitive advantage over smaller players
2305035 overall we feel microsoft is a solid choice for a safety first investment in the technology sector with the stock currently trading at less than 30 share we believe it has significant upside potential and lower than average risk in an otherwise volatile sector

2305042 hleb we have replaced with samir nasri and we also have many young players who are one year older and have learned
2305043 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and we want to continue that we were very short last year to win the championship and the champions league and thats why i believe we just have to continue with the same way we want to play and we must keep the belief
2305044 i believe we were only just short last year we lost only three games and in two out of the three we were leading 1 0 with 20 minutes to go against manchester united and chelsea
2305045 plus we have kept the basis of the team and i believe the frustration we got from not winning it in the end will come out for good we have the strength and resolve to do it we will show the needed resilience

2305078 ago dar aentender que mi top 10 es el ranking de las 10 mejores peliculas de mas agrado en el mudo no califico actor dinero invertido sino las mas gustosas
2305079 mi top 10 esta en orden y no es por que sean mis preferidas sino porque hay que ser realistas
2305080 he aqui que dios dijo hagase la tierra y la tierra se hizo
2305081 ya q les hare una oferta q n podran rehusar
2305082 escoger a tus amigos por su apariencia y a tus enemigos por su inteligencia
2305083 people have been waiting for this book for years until you takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions
2305084 1200 people live in antarctica during the summer and about 200 in winter assuming that youre not among them weve posted this time lapse video to show you what youre missing
2305085 what happened to rangers in midweek has no bearing on how we will approach this game
2305086 it might be an important game for them but it is exactly the same for us we wont feel extra pressure we know we have to play the big teams at some stage whether its on the opening day or any other day
2305087 the attitude of the players in pre season has been excellent although quite a few of them have had the bad luck to pick up knocks and if we play the way we know we can play then rangers will know theyve been in a game
2305088 nobody likes criticism in any shape or form and a football manager is no different
2305089 but you shouldnt become a manager if you cant take it it comes with the territory and after our performance on tuesday it was deserved
2305090 there will be an extra pressure on us to start the league well so our thoughts must be on that and we cant be too disappointed going to in to the falkirk match
2305091 its never an easy place to go but we have to go there and be confident of getting a win i have no doubt we can
2305092 i dont think there is any doubt that the events of last year when we lost in the uefa cup final and also lost the league will be a motivation for the players i think many of them still feel upset about the way things panned out
2305093 so we look forward to the new campaign and hope we can make amends for that
2305094 were all optimistic with just a touch of pessimism because theres always the threat of something going wrong
2305095 its not part of my psyche i have enough to concentrate on here
2305096 we had a good pre season and the players are lively but im always glad when we get the friendlies out of the way i dont enjoy them as much theyre not competitive
2305097 i was sent off five times in friendlies and only once in 832 competitive games which may tell you something
2305098 what keeps me motivated now i enjoy coaching being with the players and training i love to see them celebrating winning games and trophies thats the best thing for me
2305099 people wondered why i didnt say anything after we won the league last season but i spoke to the players and really i thought it was best for you guys and me to have a break from each other
2305100 you need to get away from my sometimes sarcastic comments it wasnt a snub
2305101 as far as this season goes i cant ask the players for any more in the way of character thats been tested physically theyre getting better so im looking for a greater ability to pass the ball 15 yards its a priceless asset
2305102 weve shown we can produce the kind of performance well need at celtic park and i told the players we need to deliver that in other games too
2305103 well after that it was inevitable we would go there first wasnt it
2305104 es a la vez el m s influyente y el menos conocido
2305105 practicing regular mindful breathing can be calming and energizing and can even help to

2305108 auf jens und den vfb freuen sich wirklich alle hier
2305109 der unterschied zwischen erster und f nfter liga ist einfach zu gro
2305110 wenn es so weiter geht dann m ssten wir gegen gladbach zu null spielen
2305111 das ist der einstand den ich mir immer gew nscht habe das tor war das i t pfelchen alles was in dieser nacht passiert ist war wundersch n
2305112 ohne van der vaart spielte real in der ersten halbzeit schlecht mit dem niederl nder in der zweiten h lfte genial
2305113 der niederl nder verkleidete sich als zidane und gab einen zauberhaften einstand
2305114 uns gliche taktik von schuster was f r ein elend
2305115 ich hatte immer telefonischen kontakt mit carlos er hat mir viel von hoffenheim und der bundesliga erz hlt deshalb ist das f r mich nichts unbekanntes
2305116 er ist ein st rmer der viele b lle erobert au erdem kommt er direkt aus der saison ist also konditionell in schuss
2305117 mit all den metallgittern rundherum war das zu gef hrlich
2305118 pfullendorf plant gegen uns das spiel des jahres das wollen wir verhindern wir m ssen zeigen wer in der bundesliga spielt jeder meiner spieler ist besser als sein gegner
2305119 damit besch ftige ich mich nicht ich gehe konsequent meinen weg denke nur an das team der job bei arminia ist f r mich kein schleudersitz
2305120 frontzeck ist vergangene saison bei uns durch ein stahlbad gegangen mit gro er skepsis und ohne r ckendeckung der fans bernahm er das traineramt nach den misserfolgen zu beginn und den anfeindungen ist er gest rkt aus der saison hervorgegangen
2305121 er hat sich ein dickes fell zugelegt und die fans haben gew rdigt dass er einen riesenanteil am klassenerhalt hat
2305122 zumindest stehen unsere eltern jetzt nat rlich st ndig mit meiner schwester in kontakt
2305123 beim anblick meiner enkel schl gt mein herz h her
2305124 die enkel haben ihrem opa auch noch einen papierstern in deutschland farben als gl cksbringer mitgegeben
2305125 wahrscheinlich ist es die j ngste elf die leverkusen je aufgestellt hat
2305126 bei einem klub wie leverkusen schon in jungen jahren verantwortung und f hrung zu bernehmen ist eine unglaubliche chance
2305127 schon fr h so eine m glichkeit zu kriegen das kapit ns amt war immer ein ziel

2305132 es war ein kleid von marc cain ich habe es schon vor einigen monaten in hamburg gekauft nicht speziell f r den heutigen tag es gefiel mir einfach weil es irgendwie asiatisch aussah im team haben wir dann abgestimmt dass ich es heute abend tragen sollte
2305133 80 prozent h tten in dieser situation draufgeknallt aber petit hat den torwart wunderbar ausgeguckt
2305134 petit hat sofort gezeigt hier bin ich das war richtig klasse sein auftritt war bravour s
2305135 es war ein sehr sch nes gef hl ich habe mich riesig ber dieses tor gefreut aber noch mehr ber unseren sieg und den einzug in die 2 runde
2305136 stimmt ich brauche noch mehr training und mehr spiele damit ich meine qualit ten in die mannschaft einbringen kann
2305137 ich muss das kompliment an meine kollegen weitergeben die mannschaft hat mir viel geholfen
2305138 arbeitet hier keiner nein ich wei dass noch ferien sind
2305139 ich bin sehr herzlich in k ln empfangen worden von klub und fans das hat mich gl cklich gemacht
2305140 ich sage nur eins die richtige geschichte wollen wir ab n chsten samstag in wolfsburg schreiben wir wollen diese gro artigen fans in k ln in der bundesliga gl cklich machen
2305141 f r uns wird es schwerer als n chste woche der bundesliga start bei bayern
2305142 wir kennen sie untersch tzen die nicht es wird sehr schwierig ausw rts bei einem sehr ambitionierten aufsteiger mit einem jungen hungrigen trainer aber wir sind gut drauf
2305143 in london ohne van der vaart zu spielen war f r uns eine herausforderung wir haben das gut gemacht das hat uns selbstvertrauen gegeben die sonne scheint wieder
2305144 jeder nachteil kann auch ein vorteil sein das hat schon johan cruyff gesagt
2305145 ich fordere russland auf mit der bombardierung friedlicher georgischer st dten aufzuh ren

2305218 i didnt know much about the draft process at the time so i was bouncing some things off of him some numbers to see how he would react and i told him i thought i would go somewhere in the fifth to eighth round most likely the fifth

2305302 it would be great if we could get alternative fuels going but since that is probably not going to happen we are going to pay the idea lip service hope for the best and let the oil companies do their thing

2305525 the collection will be designed for the edgy independent young woman whose creative approach to fashion appears effortless
2305526 the product will be linked to the quiksilver young mens brand but the overall feel will be very feminine with an end result that is casual but chic
2305527 yeah i can write a quick little post about that
2305528 we are reviewing our options regarding those titles that we will not be publishing
2305529 to work as a spy mostly thats pretty much the only reason
2305530 its gone really well all the kusports com readers love me to death theyre all really respectful towards me and have wished me nothing but the best in my new position i dont think ive gotten a negative comment since i started
2305531 i only root for two teams any team that brandon jennings is playing for and the charlotte fla high school boys basketball team other than that i have no allegiances
2305532 jim ryun is easily my favorite and probably always will be because i was a runner in high school i dont currently have a least favorite athlete but if you check back with me in a couple months thatll probably change
2305533 i think it will be a j steward this is completely a gut feeling with no evidence to support it whatsoever but i think he has a good chance to become the teams no 1 tight end this year and i think he has the body and skill set to do some amazing things from the position the ku players also voted receiver johnathan wilson as the most likely to surprise people in 2008 so im going to throw him on there too
2305534 i think he looks kind of like a bassett hound
2305535 no offense to the fine leaders of this blog but im with buzz on this one although i think blogs can sometimes be a good supplement to daily newspaper and magazine coverage theres something to be said for being in the press box being in the locker room talking to players and coaches on a regular basis thats a perspective that in my opinion blogs cant give you
2305536 with the exception of this one i hate every sports blog ever created including mine

2305575 sure im was born and raised in emporia a nice town that doesnt smell as bad as people say i always liked sports and in high school decided that sports journalism would be the way to go i started writing for the emporia gazette my sophomore year of high school during my time at ku i also had stops at the university daily kansan topeka capital journal and lawrence journal world after graduating from ku i went back to the gazette to cover emporia state athletics two years before accepting the kusports com online editor position a few weeks ago
2305576 ive been kusports com editor for a week now in college i was a part time writer for the ljw and thats when i wrote the column series about walking on for the mens basketball team journal world mens basketball beat writer gary bedore first asked me to consider trying out and i just laughed at him then the more i thought about it the more it just seemed like the right thing to do id been a ku basketball fan growing up and i figured id never have another chance to do that it turned out to be one of the most memorable things ive ever done
2305577 i actually started on monday so far im just trying to learn everything on the fly theres so much more to it than i thought plenty of computer programs to learn and items to update i love it though its been a lot of hours but it doesnt feel like work
2305578 there should be five total coming in the next few weeks that i did during media day well space them out a little bit but i would expect that those will run about twice a week media day is the perfect time to get those as you can get a lot of athletes one on one id like to keep those going during the season but a lot will depend on access once the year starts
2305579 i did have interest in woods job right before the kusports com online editor position opened up but im really happy with how things turned out honestly i think im better suited for the kusports com online editor spot with my previous experience also i know people wont want to hear this but dugan really is a good guy i know he made some people mad with his first blog and also his alma mater but its way too soon to start trying to throw him out of town i know for a fact hes a great writer and though not everyone understands it all the time it is his job to be objective its my job too i know i mentioned being a ku graduate in my first blog but really our alma maters shouldnt have an effect on the way we cover ku sports we both have jobs to do and that job involves reporting not cheering
2305580 im guessing this means basketball too i would say jacque vaughn he was everything a student athlete should be i remember wearing rubber bands on my wrist during rec league games just to be like him raef lafrentz and nick collison would be a close second and third with darnell jackson not too far behind
2305581 in basketball it was the 97 team that team was impossible to not like vaughn haase pollard lafrentz and pierce with thomas off the bench talk about loaded in football the 2005 team was a lot of fun to watch that to me was a great season because it was when the kansas players and fans first started to taste success the nebraska victory at home was a huge step for the program and i still remember driving down to fort worth thinking that this whole bowl game thing was kind of fun

2305651 our opinion is that if you optimize by function you will inevitably end up creating silos which would carry the risk of fragmentation by integrating all these services into one organization we can manage them by work process rather than by function and better leverage scale and create synergies take purchase to payment for suppliers for example some of this work is normally in procurement some in accounting and some in finance we can have one group of people who handle the whole process and so avoid handovers across multiple functions each with its own management and perhaps different objectives and incentives

2305714 racism is a doctrine of by and for brutes it is a barnyard or stock farm version of collectivism appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of animals but not between animals and men
2305715 racism is the lowest most crudely primitive form of collectivism it is the notion of ascribing moral social or political significance to a mans genetic lineage the notion that a mans intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry which means in practice that a man is to be judged not by his own character and actions but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors racism claims that the content of a mans mind not his cognitive apparatus but its content is inherited that a mans convictions values and character are determined before he is born by physical factors beyond his control this is the cavemans version of the doctrine of innate ideas or of inherited knowledge which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science

2305737 os dejo unas impresionantes fotos de brian de ayer mismo en la presentanci n del disco de su amigo greg billing donde tambien colabora esta impresionante
2305738 this has definitely been one of the greatest times ive ever had in my life
2305739 i asked david stern how about two years and he said yes he thought two years was better than one year and i think two years is better than one i think three is better than two but ill take two but of course he has to negotiate that with the nbas players union and i think the contract is up in 2 to three years but he at least at that point expressed interest in exploring two years
2305740 i would we were all of one mind and one mind good
2305741 t his summer id been shopping for a religion until in one of your classes a student asked you how one should find a tradition if one was not raised within a religion following your advice that no birth is an accident and that one should figure out where one comes from i did a little research of my own it ends up nearly all of my ancestors on my dads side are lutheran all this surprised me since my birth has generally been called an accident and id thought id come from a fairly agnostic family i met with a lutheran pastor and attended services and since then ive started reading some lutheran christian texts but im wondering if you have any more advice for me in terms of finding a tradition to belong to i feel like im kind of copping out on my spiritual quest or whatever you want to call it by just conveniently choosing a religion some people related to me were associated with it seems too easy and too intellectual and im not sure my hearts in it
2305742 all human beings worship the only question is what they worship
2305743 i sure wouldnt have believed it maybe three years ago but more and more lately ive found myself defending your and c
2305744 you must torture and kill one person in order to save an entire city from destruction what do you do
2305745 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
2305746 he who saves a life is as if he has saved the whole world
2305747 finally just war ive read bubers letter to gandhi which you mentioned in class and i really want to say that war is justified in some cases but how can you send people off to war when you know that some civilians innocents will inevitably be killed how can that be a just war
2305748 i would we were all of one mind and one mind good
2305749 ive always liked studying history but its only recently that ive started to develop actual historical perspective
2305750 an example i cant remember who exactly said it but one of the high ranking admirals in japan said after pearl harbor i fear we have awoken a sleeping giant
2305751 of course it was true but my historical study too much of an emphasis on facts i believe left out the really important part of that statement that it was a perceptive analysis and not at all obvious at the time
2305752 i guess what im trying to get at is that the past doesnt easily resonate in me and thats kind of scary
2305753 and i see this extending into avenues besides history and literature appreciation particularly in technology this disdain for the past is rampant whats heralded today as groundbreaking is mocked tomorrow as archaic
2305754 this is really scary now that i consider it if we dont appreciate and understand where we have come from and what is good in that how can we say that we have gone anywhere
2305755 what im really going for i think is that without the past my future is pretty much dead
2305756 hmmm maybe thats the really scary thing about my generation this undercurrent of individuality that all accomplishments and discoveries must be made yourself and that study of the past or learning from past masters is useless without the discovery on your own
2305757 then again im guessing life has always been like this and rather than worry that my peers arent reading plato i should get to reading myself
2305758 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2305759 if we dont appreciate and understand where we have come from and what is good in that how can we say that we have gone anywhere if its all just a set of discrete points not connected how can any one point be said to be anything other than that a random point
2305760 japanese admiral isoroku yamamoto is portrayed in the 1970 film
2305761 yamamoto believed that japan could not win a protracted war with the united states and moreover seems to have believed that the pearl harbor attack had become a blunder even though he was the person who came up with the idea of a surprise attack
2305762 the line serves as a dramatic ending to the attack and may well have encapsulated some of his real feelings about it but it has yet to be verified
2305763 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
2305764 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
2305765 while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
2305766 maybe he was drinking sure smelled like it to me
2305767 we are aware of the situation we will let the judicial process take its course and the matter will be handled internally
2305768 they did not arrest him based on anything that happened that night
2305769 but they were aware he was on probation and that he was not supposed to be drinking
2305770 as his coach and someone who cares very much about him i am disappointed that he would put himself into a compromising position especially after the commitment hes shown over the last year is his effort to return to our program
2305771 we will wait to learn all the facts before commenting any further
2305772 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
2305773 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
2305774 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
2305775 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area

2305782 we felt robin had a very good chance of qualification but in the end the ncaa eligibility center found him to be just short of eligibility to receive a scholarship from any division i university while we were aware of the risk involved with this signing and we are disappointed for robin it does not deter our confidence in finding the right student athletes for the future of this basketball program
2305783 i dont know if it really made a whole lot of sense
2305784 because one of the things they should be doing at least from my perspective is opening up the lines of communication more than closing them down
2305785 i think for the nabc just to mandate when we can offer scholarships and when we cant what we need to be doing is exploring how can we open up the lines of communication more to get to know these kids better
2305786 whether the school offers at any age really comes down to the family and what the family thinks is in the best interest of the kid i dont think anybodys forcing anybody to do anything

2305790 excuse me can you tell us what is going on with that man we saw him run by our house with a hammer earlier
2305791 well he was out on a run and found a hammer he was bringing it home to put in his trunk
2305792 oh he was quite understanding three cop cars surrounded him and came at him at gunpoint but hes a good guy just out on a run and found a hammer and someone called the cops on him

2305794 they wanted me to kill the guy you see but i wasnt going to do it i liked bruce he was like a brother to me so i travel down to boca and i know immediately where he is and so i head there i get out of the car and place a tire iron in the back of my pants i knock on the front door and this kid jeff abrahms answers he has the chain on the door so it only opens about three inches jeff i say open this door now or ill kill you and everyone in this apartment he does just that and i enter

2305796 its a tribute to the kids that we recruited that they stayed with us
2305797 after they signed somebody asked what it was like and aminu said hey we were already part of the family we were in the family when somebody in your family dies you dont leave the family the kids sticking with us just said volumes about who they were as people said volumes about their character

2305811 q how has your familys food habits influenced what you want to present in your new show
2305812 my favourite family food tradition had to be fish on fridays and because of my italian background with a roman catholic upbringing i would always prepare pasta on wednesdays so on fridays i started to combine the two into a unique dish to serve to my family
2305813 kangaroo tails the flesh of the various members of the kangaroo family the big grey kangaroo the wallaby etc is an important food item among the natives of australia and hunting the larger animals is a favorite sport of white residents kangaroo meat proper seldom reaches the united states but there is a limited importation of canned kangaroo tails when preparing for the table first warm the can then draw off the jelly and gravy and make it into a hot sauce with port wine and seasoning strain add the pieces of tail and serve with croutons of fried bread around

2305842 oh my god its a freak show in brookfield right now the lightning is like strobe lights and the thunder wont stop honey you two better get indoors
2305843 ive lived here my whole life and ive never seen anything like this
2305844 i grew up in tornado alley and were in no immediate danger
2305845 is that what that was i thought they were birds
2305846 were not going to make it back to marina city
2305847 you have 10 minutes before the heart of the storm gets there stay where you are

2305849 its a mishmash of experiments in style tape transcripts automatic writing fantasies multiple narrators false narrators you name it you can smell stale benzedrine sweat and pot smoke when you read it that said it also has some of the most beautiful passages and scenes in american literature there are pages where he so perfectly captures a mood an immediacy high in a subway station at 3 a m a touch football game on the street a film shoot in san francisco that he recreates what life is like at its most intense moments
2305850 i am at the end of my rope lord youre all ive got woe is me
2305851 im giving up everything lord or everything has been taken from me so that now you are all i have
2305852 but indeed i also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish that i may gain christ

2305854 make richmond a better place this restaurant sucks cute baby wife pothole on libbie blah blah blah
2305855 a uefa cup place is maybe a target point but the reality is that this team finished eighth and they must do better
2305856 we must make improvements what has happened in four years cant be rectified with one jump
2305857 we could put a b team in the championship and they would do well argued brian mcclair uniteds academy director
2305858 we drew with real madrid drew with paris st germain and have players who could play in the fluminense team the overall winners mcclair added
2305859 theyre not better than our best players they just have more of them
2305860 quantity of quality in foreign ranks echo the views of fabio capello
2305861 definitely learned more from this weeks exposure to madrid psg fluminense and juventus then in any academy tussle with english rivals
2305862 i watch academy games and i see humdrum stuff all the time ferguson observed
2305863 i dont see anything exciting or exceptional its always nice to see technical players like here in the premier cup
2305864 one club close to here havent played their best youth player against us for three years
2305865 nobody has played us at four v four for years
2305866 we dont accept any bad behaviour in our academy games if anybody turns round and says anything to the ref or linesmen we take them off sometimes we play with 10 men so everybody understands
2305867 in this tournament we have refs from all over the world
2305868 its ridiculous having a 10 man committee and the majority are administrators
2305869 youll win nothing with kids generation of scholes david beckham nicky butt and the nevilles burst through
2305870 there was scouting all over britain so we got the best players nationally mcclair noted
2305871 there was robbie savage chris casper and keith gillespie in that group as well when you have the best boys they challenge each other
2305872 its easier and more financially viable now to take a boy from italy or spain because of academy restrictions
2305873 fluminense can scout all over brazil but were restricted for an hour from here we still find one or two excellent boys within an hours travel but id like that rule to go the best english boy could be anywhere
2305874 until they are 14 mcclair also wants a more equitable compensation method for prospects who move from the club that has nurtured them
2305875 nobody explains how they the tribunal get the figures 750 000 up front is hefty for a 16 year old but 1 3 million if he becomes a first team player at tottenham isnt
2305876 i played with the beckham generation in the reserves and yes we could see they were talented but it was about them getting the opportunity mcclair recalled
2305877 sparky mark hughes paul parker and andrei kanchelskis went robbo bryan robson was near the end so beckham butt and gary neville all took their chance
2305878 the system is different now the demands are much greater because we won the champions league and premier league last year
2305879 that would be great if it was a local boy wed be delighted

2305881 the thames gateway is a complex urban field it is 9 times the size of barcelona has the same population as berlin and the equivalent density to los angeles
2305882 the thames gateway is predominantly treated as an overspill housing scheme when it should really be about restructuring a landscape in a dynamic flood plain which considers flood defence water storage waste recycling carbon footprint ecological corridors infrastructure and landscape frameworks it should be an architect free zone until such a proposition is on the ground we are heading for a diaspora of speculative toy town sink estates a potent mixture of low rise and high tide we have dull shifty opportunism when what we need is a long term vision where imagination can take hold large scale landscape planning of any reasonable and positive kind is shamefully absent here in fact where is the plan at all the proposition for a green grid across the thames valley is an anorexic token gesture for a straightjacket landscape at odds with natural dynamics what thames gateway needs is an altogether more voluptuous ecological wonderbra

2305896 robin hood famously robbed from the rich to give to the poor but i am certain that he never suggested that the poor should then be crammed into tower blocks like battery chickens in the name of modernist architecture until they were finally stabbed to death in a deserted stairwell there is nothing truly egalitarian about the ironically named robin hood gardens in poplar east london except the equality of squalor however wouldnt you know it modernist architects are campaigning to save it zaha hadid describes it as a seminal project of socially responsible architecture from the era of utopian thinking maybe she should go and live there herself this is a prime example of the desire for impractical modernity getting in the way of common sense and human well being

2305912 were in the process of getting it all signed and everything and thats all i can say right now
2305913 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2305914 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2305915 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2305916 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2305917 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
2305918 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2305919 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2305920 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2305921 there is no magic number of soldiers that are needed on the ground to win this campaign
2305922 what we need is security of the people we need governance we need reconstruction and development
2305923 unless you stabilize that border with pakistan and uproot the terrorist safe haven that has developed in the pakistan tribal areas youre not going to be able to stabilize afghanistan
2305924 ninety percent of the worlds opium comes from afghanistan and much of that money ends up in the hands of warlords and other militants
2305925 there is a clear linkage between narco trafficking and financing of the insurgency
2305926 there is a sense of commitment from those troops and when they go in for the fight they go in with everything theyve got
2305927 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2305928 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2305929 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2305930 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2305931 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2305932 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2305933 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2305934 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2305935 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2305936 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2305937 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2305938 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2305939 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2305940 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2305941 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2305942 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2305943 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2305944 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2305945 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2305946 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2305947 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2305948 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2305949 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2305950 while increases in domestic oil production are possible they are not where the long term debate is headed
2305951 innovation low carbon clean energy technologies are the vision that is ultimately going to win out
2305952 there are better ways to establish markets for many of these things than government mandates
2305953 sau sa mai dea un meci la o alta televiziune
2305954 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2305955 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2305956 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2305957 la nica posibilidad de evitar una grave crisis de suministro ser si hay una reducci n de la demanda debido a una fuerte recesi n y eso s lo atrasar el problema
2305958 im asking you to give me a chance to come back

2305960 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
2305961 this is the straw that will break the camels back
2305962 the stress of having 41 000 visitors come into your neighborhood to your back door over the weekend which is supposed to be your time off is beginning to wear down people
2305963 to add 40 000 more people coming into the community its burdensome to the community
2305964 it can be a hassle but you know that when you live here so you get used to it
2305965 block down all of clark street just make it one big block party every weekend
2305966 upon the conclusion of our investigation the big ten is secure in its belief that these games were not compromised
2305967 as a result of this review we have made several adjustments to our background check program we will increase the frequency of our checks to an annual review for all officials instead of a periodic review every few years
2305968 in addition we will enhance our monitoring and oversight of officials gambling activities that are legal yet unrelated to sports officials will be required to disclose any non sports related gambling activities and they will be prohibited from engaging in these activities during the period of time encompassing their officiating assignments
2305969 i feel outraged and i think media should write about this to force apple take some legal action
2305970 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2305971 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2305972 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2305973 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2305974 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2305975 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2305976 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2305977 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2305978 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2305979 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
2305980 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2305981 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2305982 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2305983 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2305984 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2305985 aaron has decided to go in a different direction as far as an agent
2305986 while i am disappointed with his decision i wish him the best
2305987 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2305988 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2305989 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2305990 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2305991 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2305992 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2305993 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2305994 were looking at some options at the moment hopefully well have someone in for the start of the season
2305995 cristiano will now settle down and enjoy his career here
2305996 he has four years left on his contract and at some point wed like to extend it thats where we are
2305997 i cant deny it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will
2305998 as cristiano gets older he will appreciate being here more that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont want to leave
2305999 if you look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds but he has become a real manchester united person who now loves the club i think cristiano realises that
2306000 alex ferguson hes outstanding and i have the utmost respect for him
2306001 evolve into something much bigger and better to support our community of players creators and sharers
2306002 the victim begins to work to see the world from the hostage takers or abusers perspective so that they may know what keeps the hostage taker or abuser happy thus helping to insure the victims survival as a result the victim becomes hypervigilant to the abusers needs and unaware of their own the victim comes to see the world from the perspective of the hostage taker or abuser losing touch with their own perspective which is unimportant or even counter productive to their survival with the denial of the violent side of the hostage taker or abuser comes denial of the danger it becomes progressively harder to separate from the hostage taker or abuser due to the fear of losing the only positive relationship identity that remains her himself as seen through the hostage taker or abusers eyes
2306003 all infidels against visiting palestine will be killed unless he converts to islam
2306004 i want to thank everybody i am happy to be here i hope that this never scares a single journalist away from coming to to cover the story because the palestinian people are very beautiful and kind hearted emphasis added the world needs to know more about them dont be discouraged we were forced to convert to islam at gunpoint dont get me wrong here i have the highest respect for islam and i learned a lot of good things aobut it but it was something we felt we had to do because they had the guns and we didnt know what the hell was going on
2306005 his assistance in securing the safe release of the two journalists also the palestinian security forces were all very helpful in the course of the last two weeks
2306006 regarding events of the past few weeks and following full and frank discussions with the club i accept that my off field behaviour has been unprofessional and have apologised to those concerned for that
2306007 id also like to extend that apology to the supporters who have been tremendous since my arrival at the club
2306008 the meeting was very positive and paul particularly impressed me by showing a strong and genuine determination to make up for lost time and to get back to recapturing his best form
2306009 i wouldnt say it is an easy job but it can only get worse i suppose if you look at it that way
2306010 im living and doing exactly what i want to do if i have a good day i enjoy it but if i have a bad day then i just have to keep doing what i do i have to keep enjoying myself and trying to improve
2306011 ive got a few text messages this evening asking me who writes them his scripts i love playing cricket and the nonsense and scrutiny that happened before the game you have to put up with but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday because i knew it was time for the cricket to start
2306012 i just went out and expressed myself it was just another day
2306013 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills and i just want to do the simple things right i played straight played a few funky shots but really i just had to get on with it
2306014 before the game i made sure i still did the right things the right amount of work on my batting i just needed that bit extra time to be at practice and talk to the lads and give them some confidence
2306015 during the three or four days in charge i have learned a lot about how the guys operate it gives you a different perspective when they are batting you really want them to do well for themselves and the team it is a holistic kind of thing and that is great
2306016 the first game against edison there was lot of pressure i was a little nervous ive got to do my job since i became the no 1 but after a couple innings i was doing well
2306017 i got over it and as the season went along i knew i was going to stay no 1 and wasnt going to lose my spot
2306018 he had done a great job for us in the summer and in the fall so we felt he was ready with the tournaments and the league we play in
2306019 we didnt know how good he was going to be but it turned out he was dominating
2306020 when the college guys would come down and talk to me theyd ask me whats this kid like
2306021 id say hes a couple miles away from being what i think is a great division i pitcher
2306022 now i think its a whole different conversation a year from now i see him with an offer of money thats going to be dangled in front of his face and hes going to have to decide between a great division i scholarship and the offer to go play professional baseball
2306023 for a big kid he has a very good feel of his off speed pitches and last fall he was able to shake hitters up and be very effective for us even with an 86 mph fastball because he knew how to pitch
2306024 now hes getting kids to speed up their bats and they have to cheat a little bit to get to the fastball and thats where he can have fun with them
2306025 he has an absolute perfect temperament for a pitcher hes very competitive but he hardly shows emotion and i think that sets him for success long term when you talk about a pro pitcher
2306026 il marketing e troppo importante per lasciarlo solo al marketing manager
2306027 what that meant is that we knew everything that became so obvious by the summer after the invasion and the president made a decision essentially to ignore that intelligence
2306028 and the letter should as well say that saddam hussein has been actively buying yellowcake uranium from niger with the help of al qaida

2306051 false friendship like the ivy decays and ruins the walls it embraces but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports
2306052 it is not only what we do but also what we do not do for which we are accountable
2306053 are you accountable for everything that happens in your school district
2306054 well to the press and board and parents i will always say that i am accountable yet i do not believe it is possible to be accountable for everything that happens in our district
2306055 yes it is really fresh it happened just yesterday we had a special education student who was arrested at one of our schools for bringing a b b gun onto the campus i dont see how i can be accountable for that happening although i have said that i was to the press and in the numerous calls i received since the incident
2306056 now i understand i am truly accountable for the incident that happened yesterday i could have put some process in place to care for troubled students in a way that their behavior would not escalate

2306070 it was simple we never ever used my name we never told anybody it was me who was going to do the interviews we even had a fake title for the film we called it a spiritual journey it didnt work everywhere we went to salk lake city but no one would let us film there at all
2306071 larry charles theory is just keep going till they throw you out i guess he learned that on borat the crew would set up and at the last second when the cameras were already rolling i would show up so either theyd be seen on camera leaving the interview and lose face or theyd have to talk to me it was like and now heres bill you could usually see the troubled looks on their faces at the holy land theme park the pr woman freaked out and finally told us to leave she was definitely not a happy camper
2306072 you could give aristotle a tutorial and you could thrill him to the core of his being such is the privilege of living after newton darwin einstein planck watson crick and their colleagues
2306073 the objections to religion are of two sorts intellectual and moral the intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow
2306074 scientific truth is too beautiful to be sacrificed for the sake of light entertainment or money astrology is an aesthetic affront it cheapens astronomy like using beethoven for commercial jingles
2306075 i am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it
2306076 i dont want to sound callous i mean even if i have nothing to offer that doesnt matter because that still doesnt mean that what anybody else has to offer therefore has to be true
2306077 it is the inevitable effect of religion on public policy that makes it a matter of public concern
2306078 it has become almost a clich to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science

2306090 the menu should be as informative of what its effect is on ones waistline as it is on their pocketbooks
2306091 not ingesting 800 calories in a meal makes a huge difference to ones health amp quality of life
2306092 if were going to fight obesity we need to teach folks about nutrition amp proper eating
2306093 i question whether this ordinance will have a real meaningful impact on peoples behavior in terms of what they eat amp how much the exercise
2306094 en virtud de que el juez responsable no estableci con razonamientos l gicos jur dicos con qu medios de convicci n se acredit el primero de los elementos del cuerpo del delito de despojo de inmuebles
2306095 resultando evidente que debi dar a conocer entre otros al indiciado con base en las disposiciones legales aplicables lo que obtuvo de cada una de esas pruebas escrituras p blicas que por s entrelazadas le permitieron arribar al conocimiento de que los hechos imputados a los activos implicaron la p rdida para alguno de la posesi n material o afectaci n de la propiedad del inmueble afecto a la causa a fin de que el indiciado pueda hacer uso de su defensa y pueda controvertirlas
2306096 estos son algunos de los puntos m s importantes de la sentencia consideramos que no hay prueba alguna que determine que la intenci n de juan gerardo era la de adue arse del predio lo cual fue el principal argumento durante el juicio de amparo y ese mismo argumento es el que pesa m s en la resoluci n ya que el juez tercero de distrito en materia penal considera que la voluntad de nuestro compa ero no fue demostrada en cuanto a su intenci n de despojar
2306097 asimismo tenemos que no existe congruencia en la denuncia lo cual es fundamental pues esto trae como consecuencia que no exista un enlace l gico en el auto de formal prisi n ya que quienes presentan la denuncia a la par es el instituto de la vivienda y el fideicomiso nueva castilla luego entonces qui n de los dos fue despojado y qui n de ellos pose a el d a de los hechos el inmueble pues de haber sido el instituto estatal de la vivienda quien lo pose a el amparo que llevaban consigo los colonos el d a 15 de mayo de 2008 era totalmente pro cedente sin embargo no puede decirse que el fideicomiso lo pose a debido a que supuestamente el instituto de la vivienda manten a la propiedad del inmueble y en ning n momento hay un documento que exprese que cedi la posesi n al fideicomiso al contrario en las actas de asamblea del fideicomiso se sugiere que tienen conocimiento de que a n hab a personas al interior del predio
2306098 es de esperarse que las resoluciones tengan el mismo sentido que la de juan gerardo incluso que sean puestos en libertad inmediata esta resoluci n puede servir de base para que los diversos juicios de amparo se resuelvan favorablemente
2306099 que finalmente desde este momento exigimos que el gobierno deje de favorecer intereses de particulares en perjuicio de la libertad de nuestros cinco compa eros presos que responda a las exigencias de los familiares que tienen a sus hijos en prisi n injustamente y en cuanto a los colonos que les sean reconocidas sus posesiones en la nueva castilla pues sus abogados han estado haciendo lo correcto en relaci n a las estrategias jur dicas que han tomado

2306102 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2306103 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2306104 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2306105 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2306106 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2306107 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2306108 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2306109 im more concerned about turning over the ball the way we have the last three games than with how our defence has played
2306110 my feeling is theres little difference between the team thats 6 0 right now saskatchewan and the team thats 1 5
2306111 its about 12 plays that separates all the teams from being just like us 3 3
2306112 were going into a tough situation on friday night against a championship calibre team
2306113 we could have closed out those games so we put that on ourselves
2306114 no matter how many points we put up we need to improve
2306115 we could have sustained more drives killed more clock and that would have really improved our chances of winning we did a good job against hamilton last week with three minutes to go and we have to do the same
2306116 with all due respect to ryan he is not the best quarterback on the winnipeg blue bombers
2306117 kevin glenn playing well and being supported is the only chance the bombers have to fight their way back into the playoff race
2306118 weve got good talent here its a matter of everyone working together
2306119 im going to try to give us a little confidence boost
2306120 im going to come in with a chip on my shoulder and im going to go out there and give it everything i can to win this game
2306121 its a guy who played two games for us and gave us a spark gave us the ability to be more productive running the football and when there was an opportunity made big plays
2306122 footballs a game of what have you done for me today and when you look at trying to win a football game youve got to look at the personnel and put in the guys you feel can help you win
2306123 so when you get out there you want to do everything you can to help the team win
2306124 thats what gives you a chip on your shoulder you want to get out there and show everybody that youre the man who can get it done
2306125 hes more of a downhill runner hes a big guy
2306126 im a small scatback or whatever you want to call me but ive been trying to prove to people that just because of my size doesnt mean i cant run inside and outside
2306127 they just think i can get the ball on a toss or a sweep and hit it straight outside but youve got to try to prove people wrong
2306128 hes not accountable to me when it comes to that
2306129 hes accountable to himself and his teammates i dont focus on the players who arent playing i focus on the 42 that are
2306130 we were just being selfish everyone wanting to make the play and not just buying into the program and getting the job done
2306131 so until we get the problem fixed with ourselves its going to be a long lengthy season but i dont think its going to be that way
2306132 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2306133 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2306134 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2306135 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2306136 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2306137 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2306138 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2306139 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2306140 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2306141 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2306142 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2306143 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation

2306145 really likes the necklace but its not authentic and i shouldnt have listed it as 100 authentic

2306147 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2306148 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2306149 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2306150 it is important that these cases go forward at the pace that justice requires
2306151 prosecutors cannot should not accelerate cases but should try them with as much dispatch as they can recognizing that timely justice is appropriate both for the accused and society
2306152 mr hamdan is about to make a phone call home to yemen
2306153 and i think it will be a much easier one than one that some other folks have to make to dc
2306154 oooh ill buy this one for dad he likes these
2306155 marriage is a commitment of several years of your life plus child support
2306156 ah because her hair is like corn silk under an august moon her lips are as rubies and her teeth pearls and her smile would make a dead man cry
2306157 she likes everyone and is having a lovely time playing with someone different
2306158 he tells me he still doesnt remember about his past
2306159 fine calm concerned very rational naturally hes very concerned being locked up in prison
2306160 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2306161 we are now checking if he could be the german citizen christian karl gerhartsreiter
2306162 in germany up to now he has not been conspicuous we know nothing about him
2306163 in every place there are troublemakers some stay like that and others change
2306164 but i wouldnt want to come out and say definitively who this person is
2306165 were probably not going to confirm this persons identity until we have a birth certificate in our hands
2306166 he was like guys you arent even going to school that much
2306167 i didnt get a creepy feeling i just thought that he was a spoiled brat
2306168 that we were peasants and his father had told him not to talk to peasants
2306169 he had a kind of a rich person kind of distance thing going on
2306170 he can be funny at times witty laughs at your jokes he walked into the yacht club pretending like he owned the place
2306171 he claimed hed ordered some furniture that hadnt arrived yet
2306172 customers like industrials theyve been oversaturated with banks and finance
2306173 he was a sales manager and never made a sale so eventually he was fired
2306174 if anybody touches my stuff ill bring my german luger
2306175 it started to become very apparent that whatever he said was a story it was made up
2306176 at most places but especially wall street your word is your bond and whenever you get someone like this youre sitting on a liability and so it was that more than anything that prompted the firm to decide that wed be better of without him
2306177 thats a year removed we dont dwell on those things you guys do
2306178 i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the five bonus points and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence
2306179 fortunately we have been lucky enough to win seven races we can only hope that we win a couple more and try to get further ahead of the competition when the chase starts
2306180 yes i think so i think a lot of it might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrips the bobby allisons and others
2306181 we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect you have to be a whole lot more stale today than you want to be
2306182 the racing was different but i personally dont think it was better then i think actually if you laid down two races side by side what we have today and what they had then i think you would sell more tickets to what we have today but i think if you ask the fans what lot of drivers they would prefer they might say the old guys i would
2306183 i wouldnt like to see it done just by watching the race last week there was really no passing unless someone ran off the racetrack
2306184 i thought goodyear did an excellent job of showing how prepared they were for that
2306185 im their biggest critic at times but im the first guy that when they do things right im going to praise them too
2306186 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2306187 too many consumers spend time on the internet without knowledge or notice that they are under commercial surveillance
2306188 they assume they are in the privacy of their own home and that this privacy will be respected unfortunately this is not always the case
2306189 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2306190 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice

2306202 did you know theres a van parked on our playground
2306203 quanto nuovo audace tragico e radicalmente diverso da tutte le interpretazioni mai sentite di
2306204 straordinariamente solo su una strada di teatro che nessun altro poi percorrer
2306205 quando c riccardo muti sul podio e sempre di pi negli ultimi tempi come in un gesto di deliberata solitudine o solipsismo la clessidra del teatro parte solo dal podio
2306206 l ha luogo quasi sempre lazione tutti fermi impalati come manichini
2306207 a prevalere lo scatenarsi di una violenza esasperata sul limite della rottura degli equilibri sonori e del rumore ma proprio per questo il capolavoro verdiano sembra acquistare una luce nuova lo scavo nell inferno delle passioni come sempre sospese nell irreale di un mondo come lo si vede e non come proietta unombra cupa amarissima sulla visione che l ultimo verdi ha della vita verdi sotto la bacchetta di muti il compositore della disperazione senza speranza
2306208 sulla scena si vede uno spettacolo bellissimo ma non di uguale forza interpretativa
2306209 quest otello concertato da muti di un suono sontuoso rutilante eppur trasparente che fa vibrare tutta la sala dai vertici dellottavino alle note gravissime del cimbasso
2306210 antonenko diciamo che se non oggi un otello perfetto lo sar domani
2306211 ah la meraviglia la solipsistica grandezza del direttore la disperazione senza conforto dellultimo verdi peccato il cattivo regista che ha ingessato i cantanti peccato la compagnia con luci e ombre forse non allaltezza del grande direttore ma si sa i grandi direttori come eroi romantici devono lottare contro le avversit del destino e il destino aveva scelto per loro quei cantanti
2306212 riccardo muti responsabile di molti problemi semplicemente suona cos forte da non lasciare spazio a nessuno
2306213 la compagnia restava imbambolata il pi vicino possibile alla ribalta con gli occhi fissi a muti il verdi di muti esplosivo teso e carico di energia grezza ma anche fracassone brutale e sgradevolmente autocratico
2306214 niente da dire riccardo muti viene da una lunga tradizione verdiana ma proprio questo il problema non viene soltanto l rimane e non fa che riprodurla
2306215 quello che riccardo muti fa di una delle partiture pi intelligenti e avanzate rasenta lo scandalo si tratta del solito trucco finch suoni fortissimo nessuno si accorge di nulla
2306216 i just want to go out there and execute whatever we are in
2306217 any time you step between those lines you want to be at your best so any time i step on the field whether its practice a walk through whatever im trying to be perfect
2306218 i think you want to continue to see the progression and if that progression ever stops and its not where you want it to be then thats when you would make a decision
2306219 but right now everything weve asked him to do hes done improvements that weve asked him to make hes made
2306220 theres been more good than bad but i just have to be more consistent ive felt like this year more than last year i can have a bad play and continue to have a good practice after that in the past if i had a bad play id continue to have a downslide in practice i had a bad play here and there and i feel like after that bad play i pretty much move on
2306221 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2306222 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2306223 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2306224 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2306225 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2306226 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2306227 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2306228 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it moreso than a lot of people can
2306229 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2306230 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2306231 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2306232 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2306233 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2306234 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2306235 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more

2306276 nearly 60 per cent of the energy savings achieved under eec2 2005 2008 came from the installation of insulation measures over 10 per cent was achieved in lighting with heating and appliances making up the remainder
2306277 we also need to help people individually with what they can do to insulate and reduce their energy needs
2306278 i have been campaigning for a long time about the fact energy prices were going to go up and there is nothing you can do about it because there are a lot more people in the world demanding energy and energy resources are much more limited
2306279 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2306280 favouring involving or necessitating thorough going but constitutional social and political reform
2306281 a belief in the need for social and political reform that goes right to the roots of society
2306282 i like sex so how can i be sex negative
2306283 i just dont think that banning porn and sex work and effectively demonizing sex and sexuality is the way forward i think its important to remember that actually there are lots of sex workers who arent trafficked and didnt have horrific lives of abuse leading to their sex work and arent drug users and are there because they want to be because they choose to be whilst also working to help those who are there and dont want to be i think it is important to remember to that these are people that we oh so sanctimoniously blog about these are women and men cis and transgendered living their lives the way they choose and who the fuck am i or you to come along tell them they are wrong remove their humanity by using terms like funfeminist in a derogatory fashion
2306284 so yeah i sit around reading blogs and i see a lot of anti sex industry types talking on and on about how people in the biz voluntary or not are selling themselves hey doesnt much matter what the actual people in the biz say they say it anyway me i think we all do it to an extent you go on a job interview youre not just selling your ability to do the job youre selling you there is a reason people shower shave dress up brush their teeth dress nicely when they go on interviews and its because we all know deep down part of the product were selling is ourselves and sure enough in my time ive know some people who do it really well some real slick stylish sorts hustlers whores artists lawyers husbands and wives spin men and promoters hell from it guys to waitresses who can turn bullshit into gold or have a great line on a bridge if you want to buy it sure enough ive seen some people who are damn good at selling themselves
2306285 so yeah thats whats disappoiting being constantly on the defense against people who actually dare to think their opinion is worth something when its utterly unresearched why the fuck should anyone listen to sex positive feminism is fun feminism what exactly is fun about repressed sexuality because thats what were dealing with slut shaming whats fun about that whats fun about jokes regarding dead sex workers rape and what pray tell me is fun about having arseholes like you bitch on about pretty women
2306286 moving forward well be providing a summary of the data use and encouraging customers to go online or call telstra if they would like a detailed breakdown
2306287 how long does it take for you to write a blog post
2306288 social media sites need freshness not just for the sake of it but because any business needs to remain top of mind and have something to say if it wants to be a credible online player
2306289 if a woman prays her five daily prayers and keeps her private parts chaste and obeys her husband she will enter paradise from any of the doors of paradise she wishes
2306290 it is not lawful for a woman to fast while her husband is present unless she has his permission and she must not allow anyone in his home except with his permission
2306291 when a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come to him and he spends the night angry with her the angels curse her until the morning arrives
2306292 by the one in whose hand my soul is there is no man that calls his wife to bed and she refuses him except that the one who is above the heavens is displeased with her until he the husband becomes content with her
2306293 the woman is the caretaker of her husbands household and she will be questioned as to her responsibility
2306294 therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husbands absence what allaah orders them to guard i e their chastity
2306295 this mandates the unrestricted obligation of a woman obeying her husband in all affairs such as serving him traveling with him assisting him and other matters as is indicated in the sunnah of allaahs messenger
2306296 those who say that it is obligatory for the woman to serve the husband use this ayah as proof in that those who allaah directed his speech to on this occasion considered this to be from good but as for the woman relaxing and having the husband serve her sweep grind the flour knead the bread wash the clothes fix the bed and serve the household then that is from and allaah says and they women have rights over their husbands similar to those of their husbands over them men are the protectors and maintainers over women so if a woman doesnt serve her husband but instead he acts like a servant to her then this means that she is the protector and maintainer over him
2306297 for indeed allaah obligated him to spend on her to clothe her and to provide her with a place of dwelling in exchange for his enjoying her and her serving him as well as what the habits of the spouses call for likewise the binding marriage agreements require that the spouses live in kindness and kindness means a womans serving her husband and taking care of the inner affairs of the household
2306298 and there is no difference as to whether the woman is prestigious or lowly or if she is poor or rich
2306299 imagine being able to talk to monet michelangelo and leonardo
2306300 thats who these people are to jazz except theyre alive and you can get to know them personally ill never get a chance like this again
2306301 its as though the albums ive loved for years have jumped off the shelf and are running around talking to me like in the cartoons i sometimes cant believe it
2306302 the gift jazz legends have given us is enormous in addition to producing timeless art that stirs our moods jazz motivates us to take creative risks and respect beauty no matter what we do
2306303 vicki and her father persuaded a record company into cutting it with joe valino vocalizing on the gold star label first to predict its success were joe grady and ed hurst who introduced the waxing on their wpen program valinos record proved a hit with disc jockeys here started to catch on in other parts of the country he has just returned from a disc jockey tour that took him as far as california sinatra heard valinos version liked it and the rest is history
2306304 back in late 1954 or early 1955 two guys came up to my office at barton music on the fourth floor of new yorks brill building they had a record they wanted me to hear after we played it a few times they asked me what i thought of the singer i liked the singer fine but i flipped over the song it was learnin the blues i thought the singer a guy named joe valino was good but to me he sounded too much like sinatra dozens of singers were modeling their sound after franks but the song wow that was different it was a hit my job at barton was to listen to songwriters songs and demo recordings and identify the ones that had the potential to be a big seller i had managed a bunch of record stores on sixth avenue years earlier and had a knack for picking songs that would become hits record executives used to play songs for me to get my reaction before moving forward so i became a publishing manager but finding great songs was only half of it you had to match a great song to the right singer when that happened you had magic great songs recorded by the wrong singers usually went no place a song had to work with the singers personality and style to connect when you had that the song clicked with the public and became a hit for example when i first heard cy colemans im gonna laugh you right out of my life in 1955 i knew it was a hit when i brought it to the attention of nat king cole he played it on the piano while i sang the lyrics then he played and sang it about 20 times he heard what i had heard and loved it the next week he recorded it and the song hit the charts and the song became a standard the same thing happened with earl and alden shumans and marshall browns seven lonely days in 1953 i first heard about the song from elliott kastner a friend in the william morris agency mailroom he called me and said his pals had written a lousy song but he was honoring a promise to call me i said to send them over when the writers arrived we went into a studio and they played and sang it for a demo i could hear right away it was great i also knew the song would be perfect for georgia gibbs when i went over to see her she resisted she thought it was too hillbilly but the more she rehearsed it that day the more she realized she had a hit on her hands she recorded it that night and had a hit with it so back to learnin the blues i knew it was big when i asked the two guys in my office who brought in the joe valino single for the name of the songwriter they wouldnt give it to me they were there in my office for the singer they said after a while they told me that the songwriter was a woman named vicki silvers i asked where she lived they told me in philadelphia but they wouldnt give me her address as soon as they left i got on the phone and found out she was married to a guy named arthur silvers a wealthy guy who was in the clothing business when i called him up sure enough vicki silvers was his wife so i told him who i was that i worked for sinatras publishing company and i made an appointment to meet with them the next day those two guys were in my office on friday i was on a train to philadelphia the next morning to meet with silvers when i got to the house a woman who looked like ava gardner opened the door i said i was there to see miss silvers she told me she was vicki silvers i was stunned she looked like a movie actress when i went in and spoke with vicki and her husband i told them i was crazy about the song and that i wanted to bring it to sinatra they were excited i always carried blank contracts with me when i took one out they wanted to add a clause it said that if within six months sinatra had no interest in the song the rights would return to silvers i was fine with that i knew that if sinatra didnt record it the song wouldnt likely become big so vicki silvers signed and the copyright transferred to barton publishing whose job it was to make the song popular no advance changed hands in those days a songs writer made money only after the song hit and revenue came in through the sale of singles and sheet music the valino single and silvers contract to frank military sinatras longtime aide he sent the record out with about 20 others to sinatra sinatra received the package that monday sinatra apparently went through all the demos in the package but the only one he picked was valino singing learnin the blues he recorded it soon after in march 55 bonus laughs and he took all the credit for finding it about a month later i quit and took a job at fischer publishing joe valino didnt have a hit with learnin the blues sinatras success with the song thanks to the sinatra single joe got more exposure for his version and landed a record deal with rca
2306305 jazz entertainers are neither fish nor fowl they do not get the million dollar protection hollywood and broadway can afford for their stars who have become addicted and there are many more than will ever be revealed perhaps this is because jazz once considered a decadent kind of music has only token respectability jazz grew up next door to crime so to speak clubs of dubious reputation were for a long time the only places where it could be heard but the times bring changes and as billy holiday sic was a victim of time and change so too was charlie parker a man whose music like billies is still widely imitated most musicians credit parker among others as spearheading what is called modern jazz

2306333 a big part of the rising interest in mindfulness is that more and more therapists are practicing some form of contemplation themselves and want to bring that into therapy
2306334 increasing mindfulness rather than mindlessness can help patients recast their experiences in a different light as well as help clinicians approach patients problems from a different perspective
2306335 a mindful perspective can have a useful impact on the decisions of a mental health professional regarding diagnostic issues and coordination with the primary care physician and staff

2306348 among adolescents who have characteristics associated with being inclined to make a virginity pledge making a virginity pledge delays sexual initiation
2306349 findings should not be taken as evidence that virginity pledges should be imposed upon adolescents for youth who want to have sex and whose social environments support doing so pledging is not likely to be an effective means of delaying sexual initiation and it is doubtful that sincere pledges could be elicited from such youth these youth need sex education that helps reduce sexual risk taking and unintended pregnancy as do the substantial number of pledgers who eventually have sex santelli ott lyon rogers amp summers 2006 moreover it is questionable whether being coerced into making a pledge will be effective even for teens who have characteristics like those of teens who pledge voluntarily psychological theory would suggest that pledging will have an effect on behavior to the extent that the pledger believes he or she freely chose to make a pledge festinger 1957

2306410 hackers will continue to get creative and leverage user created content and web 2 0 applications to create even bigger security concerns for organizations
2306411 researchers expect attackers to see a rise in special interest attacks targeting specific groups of people based on interests and profiles with an increase in spam and talk back sections of new sites new active media web modules scripting and social networks organizations will need to ensure their web messaging and data security programs are adequate to plug the holes and curb the new avenues hackers exploit to spread malicious code for financial gain
2306412 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
2306413 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers

2306422 there is always the potential you have a vulnerable piece of software you come up with a fix for it thats great but this gives the attackers that didnt know that this vulnerability existed a way to analyze it
2306423 to ask what did they exactly fix here and how can i if i find the machine that does not have the fix applied exploit that machine if i find that software somewhere else and that holes still there i might be able to exploit it this way so they can then work on an automatic exploit for that
2306424 so i think what dan wanted to avoid here was this situation he wanted to enable the majority of vendors to release this patch at the same time to make that window where it could be analyzed much smaller and hes actually said publicly that they have spent some time on making the way they fix it difficult to re engineer not only fix it but also how can you make it difficult for somebody to look at the fix and understand what the exploit was
2306425 after an enormous and secret effort weve got fixes for all major platforms all out on the same day this has not happened before everything is genuinely under control
2306426 or at least close to the same day apples round of fixes to bind were announced just last week

2306428 we just cant be 10th in the country for salaries and expect we would get the best people
2306429 i recognize that in being the top decision makers they do have increased salaries what we have to do is make sure people who are responsible for budgets are the best we can possibly have from across the country or from within the civil service
2306430 we cant give people a minimum wage increase havent had one since 2001 the government fights that tooth and nail yet the premiers top deputy can get a 105 000 pay increase
2306431 thats a gold medal in arrogance if there ever was one
2306432 to give 35 per cent and 43 per cent increases to people who are already making 10 times what the average person makes in this province is an insult to everybody who pays a penny of taxes
2306433 and secondly theyve frozen the minimum wage going on eight years
2306434 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2306435 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2306436 i really wish they would just let the process go through well win the whole thing is very unconstitutional theyre violating the canada health act and women dont have equal access to abortion in this province they do not
2306437 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
2306438 our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful it will do so
2306439 they were all picked up and are being questioned at the moment

2306471 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2306472 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2306473 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2306474 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2306475 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2306476 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2306477 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2306478 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it moreso than a lot of people can
2306479 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2306480 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2306481 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2306482 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2306483 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2306484 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2306485 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more

2306499 the main subject was the disastrous events of tuesday night
2306500 walter was not asked if he felt he was under pressure he was asked if he can get us out of this situation
2306501 the guy was being honest he knows what he has to do next and we need to give him the chance
2306502 he explained the teams strengths and why he set out the team the way he did last season which was largely successful to be fair
2306503 but he also openly admitted that he has to move on from that and thats what he will attempt to do
2306504 we felt we were lacking flair and creativity and we were told that was what was being addressed and what the club are actively looking for
2306505 we now expect two creative midfield players to be on the books before the end of the month
2306506 it was a positive meeting we had fears beforehand that we dont have anymore

2306539 i think what fascinates him about catholicism is its historical plausibility
2306540 he does appreciate the systematic theology of the church its intellectual cogency and stability
2306541 is not unaware of how evangelicalism by comparison with catholicism may seem more limited both theologically and historically

2306577 maar hoewel beyonc er wel klaar voor is wil ze nog minstens twee jaar wachten ze is erg gefocust op haar carri re en wil niet dat die wordt tegengewerkt door het krijgen van kinderen
2306578 aanvankelijk dacht ik waarom moet mij dit overkomen ik wist totaal niet hoe er mee om te gaan

2306594 utilities have delayed decades of upgrading their distribution grid and the technology has finally reached a price point and functionality where it makes sense to deploy
2306595 utilities are embracing multiple year capacity spending plans and we continue to be in the early stages of the smart grid
2306596 investors have to temper these results because utilities dont buy en masse when new technology comes along they are very risk averse buyers
2306597 we see a handful of early adopters but the bell curve of other utilities are going to want to wait and see this stuff work when it gets deployed
2306598 the macro economic environment just couldnt be better and the amount of movement and chatter among utilities is very very high
2306599 its just about keeping expectations in check about when some of these awards will start entering the field and how that translates into profits

2306610 we won the big 12 north last year the university of missouri hasnt won a big 12 championship yet
2306611 expectations are very high for our program in lawrence in the state of kansas and around the country
2306612 we embrace those expectations because there was a time when i first arrived here that there were no expectations for kansass football program
2306613 weve been in six big 12 championship games and won five of them we are doing something right
2306614 we know how to win those games and well manage these others as best we can
2306615 i think everyone knows the great quarterbacks that are out there in this league
2306616 he might be the 12th best quarterback in the big 12
2306617 a lot of teams dont respect the wac for some reason i dont know why
2306618 i hate the polls id like to be picked right about the middle of the pack then we just go do our thing
2306619 you will not hear one word out of anyone about 2007
2306620 im not looking for toe in the water type of players
2306621 im looking for players that arent waiting to see how things go theyre going to be part of making things go
2306622 im going to do everything i can to make sure last year doesnt happen again
2306623 of course its going to be in the back of some of our heads as some sort of motivation
2306624 but its not something were dwelling on its not something were constantly reflecting back on
2306625 where is the man responsible for this where is the director of electricity ill track him down
2306626 we dont push too hard against the taliban or the government
2306627 we say general things to avoid trouble security is not good electricity is not good people are moving away from kandahar the municipality does nothing about the garbage in the streets but we dont say anything about specific leaders
2306628 why arent you building factories to employ our young people
2306629 if we make factories for young people who will fight how will i get my money from foreign governments
2306630 everything is more expensive now even spoiled pakistani fruit is selling for high prices the ngos try to help by giving us wheat but people steal it and smuggle it out of the country

2306634 we dont feel like adult entertainment is what we want at the gateway to our community
2306635 given the absence of allowances for this use either outright or with a special use permit it is the countys interpretation that the use is prohibited
2306636 im getting the feeling theyre willing to change their approach
2306637 we certainly have no problem with an espresso stand but as it was originally proposed it was erotic entertainment
2306638 they said they just didnt expect the backlash theyve gotten
2306639 what in the world do i have to do to get the ball in the hole
2306640 nexus between drugs and terror is growing at light speed
2306641 if i tell her sweetie weve got game 5 of the nba finals on shes willing to give me a little slack most of the time though the tv is on hgtv and i suffer that silently
2306642 critics and some others whose judgment is steered by political ideology will of course always find fault with and try to discredit these articles and our photos we understand that no amount of proof will satisfy these people
2306643 but the facts we have uncovered are undeniable and the photos once again advance the story of edwards affair and cover up to a place where he must not only address this situation but go beyond his previous dismissive rhetoric
2306644 its just a blurry mess its just a blurry baby and a blurry guy holding it
2306645 so it comes down to one other question and thats the credibility of the person offering it if the associated press said they had spent a year figuring this out and they would verify the picture i would take it a little bit more seriously but this is the national enquirer
2306646 well the national enquirer has finally delivered the goods in the form of spy photos revealing an edwards type figure hoisting aloft a remarkably human looking child
2306647 either you have a photo or you dont what appears above is basically a john edwards avatar cradling a cyber baby
2306648 as a reporter who lived through monica lewinsky weve been here before
2306649 and the question to me for those of us who adhere to certain standards of ethics is how do we respond to this
2306650 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
2306651 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv and unwanted pregnancies and could have empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
2306652 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more
2306653 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience to bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2306654 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2306655 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement

2306662 deal rose has with mlb is that he is banned for life
2306663 that is what everyone has been asking us did you guys know
2306664 we planned this out months ago we just find it so ironic that all this happening with favre
2306665 it would be huge it would take a lot of van loads a lot of truck loads
2306666 weve looked at other building but were happy here and thats whats kept us here
2306667 this place is kind of edgy a lot of youthful vibrance there have been plans done that would be a wonderful connectivity between downtown and the bay
2306668 id be silly to not admit id have a lot of business but im thinking a little bit more beyond myself here and why im here at the warehouse district

2306672 i wasnt able to put any steering in the front end of the car so i dont know
2306673 ive seen what versus has done for the tour de france and if they do the same kind of job for us then i can only think it will be much better for the irl
2306674 we also welcome the financial and programming commitment versus will make to tell the story about the drivers teams and series to the public
2306675 what do you think the biggest adjustment has been from college to the pros

2306694 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex
2306695 in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex

2306716 having the conference come on the heels of the pepfar authorization was really encouraging we also know that death rates of aids are starting to come down and that correlates with the increase in access to treatment that people have
2306717 the disappointing news is that on the prevention front some of the things we would have hoped would be reported werent reported
2306718 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 percent everywhere
2306719 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes
2306720 none of those have brought the promise that we thought they might
2306721 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
2306722 many promising avenues of prevention are being discussed in mexico city but none is more essential than an hiv vaccine with hiv we will have to do better than nature if we are to develop a vaccine

2306728 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established

2306730 i saw the pin on 13 and i knew 12 and 13 would be birdie holes
2306731 i hit some good shots on those holes and made birdie
2306732 after my third birdie the next four holes were into the wind and i was just trying to make par on those holes
2306733 i just have to go out there and play and hopefully it will happen
2306734 i was excited about the conditions this morning or what i thought they were going to be
2306735 i figured they would be nice and calm i shot a decent score but i did it in some conditions that were much tougher than what i expected to face

2306742 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2306743 critics and some others whose judgment is steered by political ideology will of course always find fault with and try to discredit these articles and our photos we understand that no amount of proof will satisfy these people

2306780 we planned this out months ago we just find it so ironic that all this happening with favre
2306781 it is not going to be an easy game because we have not seen them play since last season while on other hand they have seen us playing for the past four weeks we are fully confident though that we are going to do well the boys are focused
2306782 we worked on possibilities this week worked on standard situations we will have a last session this afternoon to polish tactical aspects of the game itumeleng khune will miss the game after getting a red card in our last game last season
2306783 that would be an excuse we have had balanced sessions to ensure that the team does not suffer from playing many games before the start of the season
2306784 mom i need a yellow kid sized umbrella to match my jacket and galoshes
2306785 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate

2306787 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2306788 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2306789 humans fail to recognize that wild animals are never obese they have to work for a living for every mouse or bird like us their bodies arent meant for these surges of sweet and fat they overeat and their bodies cant cope
2306790 dogs arent meant to be overweight a dog has never found a hot dog in the wild they shouldnt eat them and neither should humans
2306791 my boston terrier fly trains for agility with a single dry kernel of low fat pet food it has a 1 2 calorie per piece hes amazingly trained and i dont give him probably more than 15 extra calories per day
2306792 i wanted to try to some way kind of do what they used to do when they traveled around in the old days
2306793 taking the train where the players can move around and relax a little bit will give us some time that i think we need at this point to get ready for a game
2306794 i had me a long vacation not saying that i wanted it
2306795 its football season and im happy to be back to work
2306796 im doing everything that im supposed to do to make sure i get reinstated
2306797 im not even worried about that right now im worried about playing football staying out of trouble and making sure i know my plays

2306800 jo vi kan ta nu f r bolibompa r p timeshift
2306801 i can only conclude that the lack of negotiations stem from the democrats unwillingness to talk about any solutions that do not include a tax increase
2306802 we can balance this budget without tax increases and it is imperative that we do so now
2306803 balancing this budget is going to take sacrifice on the part of every californian but legislative democrats believe the search for new revenues should start with those who have reaped the most benefits from federal and state tax breaks in the past
2306804 californias public employees and children should not be held hostage by the governors tactics or by republicans protecting wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals from paying their fair share
2306805 in fact the budget bill was the very next item on the agenda but democrats chose to adjourn before we could take it up because they are afraid to debate the issue
2306806 liberals like nancy pelosi and charlie brown want to continue supporting federal laws that prevents us from tapping americas vast oil resources thats how we got into this mess and why gasoline prices are now breaking our family budgets
2306807 america has nearly a trillion barrels of recoverable oil more than three times that of saudi arabia that democrats like nancy pelosi and charlie brown wont even let us touch in fact more than 94 percent of our territory remains off limits because of this foolish prohibition if we want to change this policy weve got to change this congress
2306808 in fact the budget bill was the very next item on the agenda but democrats chose to adjourn before we could take it up because they are afraid to debate the issue
2306809 we knew that the number of people staying in liberty square should not exceed 300 at dawn but when we arrived at the square there many more of them there they were not sleeping and were ready to meet us with armed resistance
2306810 if fleeing demonstrators left guns behind them then why is it that during their dispersal which was accompanied by beatings and resistance not a single gunshot was fired
2306811 according to our operational data there should have been more weapons and ammunition
2306812 i hope im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics
2306813 as i did watching the sydney olympics i hope all the countries and all the nations are there watching and they will learn from where i came from and things like that
2306814 man i would like to be the one carrying that flag
2306815 thats what our country is built on survival and fighting he was the best ambassador to carry the flag and represent the united states
2306816 when it comes down to it politics and athletics dont mix and everybody in that room was an athlete nobody was a politician his nomination to bear the flag came from the purest of decisions
2306817 he told us his story and its unbelievable we are honored to have him carry the flag to hear all the different things that he went through to get this opportunity is unbelievable i think some of those things we take for granted
2306818 not for one moment did i think it was a political statement
2306819 we had a great opportunity to meet him in colorado in our last training camp and we feel its a great choice by the u s delegation
2306820 his story alone just represents the epitome of the american dream and its something the whole world should look at and read about and view as an inspirational story were very proud to follow him at the opening ceremonies
2306821 we are certainly concerned about the situation and hope that a solution will be found very quickly
2306822 we hope that the parties will make maximum efforts to quickly stop bloodshed and find peaceful solutions to contentious issues

2306824 in 1860 the census reports for a dozen western states and territories showed the 50 percent school attendance for black women that equaled that of white women the 26 percent illiteracy rate for african american women on the frontier was much lower than that for white frontier women women of color in the wilderness consistently distinguished themselves through their dedication to self improvement and zeal for education
2306825 in a 1790 census african american men and women constituted 18 percent of californias population los angeles was founded in 1781 by forty four people twenty six of them of african descent maria rita valdez born to one of these african families in los angeles owned what is now beverly hills
2306826 in sacramento in 1859 african american parents began their own school for thirty to thirty five pupils mostly girls and hired a white teacher within a year the city board of education awarded three of its female pupils silver achievement medals
2306827 unlike white pioneers most former slave women and men rejected farm work for town jobs they associated rural life with the pain and social isolation of southern plantations and slavery during that time european peasant immigrants for similar reasons overwhelmingly chose urban life over rural life in america they associated farm work with the oppressive conditions they had fled in europe for a white woman a job on the frontier usually served as a bridge between arrival time and marriage for a woman of color married or unmarried a paying job was a necessity black women of the west were five times as likely to be employed as white women and twice as likely to be employed as asian or native american women
2306828 in 1900 as the african american population of colorado grew urban women of color built a host of societies to fortify them in their daily struggles against bigotry in denver the formed the colored ladies legal rights association the colored womens republican club and the womens league in 1901 augustavia youn then sixteen formed the pond lily art and literary club to challenge the local newspapers negative images of women of color by the early twentieth century colorado women had formed clubs for lovers of art books and other literary maters in 1916 four clubs united to establish a day nursery that was still operating in 1992 these clubs welcomed working and middle class women members generally were married had children and most were high school graduates many were employed outside their homes as teachers seamstresses maids and musicians club meetings were held on weekdays in an effort to encourage attendance by people who as laundresses and domestics worked on saturdays
2306829 by 1892 langston city had six hundred people from twenty different states the
2306830 homes churches and schools where you can raise your family in good and respectable society
2306831 how do you expect other races to respect our ladies when you fail to do so yourselves
2306832 from the beginning lanstonians particularly its women embraced education with a passion
2306833 het is vooral nostalgie verlangen naar de betere tijden we hebben de laatste jaren t veel shit gehad om dit nu nog belangrijk te vinden
2306834 iedereen had het goed tijdens zijn jaren hij hield joegoslavi bij elkaar het was een goede man
2306835 i felt my body totally collapse i then hit the ground
2306836 when it the ball hit me it all went black white black white
2306837 i felt my body totally collapse i then hit the ground and then opened my eyes and the sky was right above me
2306838 three weeks ago i couldnt sit up i used to fall over
2306839 now i can sit up and actually managed to stand two days ago for a short time
2306840 they used to hoist me from the bed onto the wheelchair but as from today i can use a sliding board which makes it a lot easier
2306841 i would say everybody after seeing what phils been through wear a helmet
2306842 you can be hit on the head and have a serious head injury so please wear a helmet
2306843 a relatively simple ruse persuaded dozens of prominent security analysts to connect on their social networking web pages with people who werent friends at all they were fake profiles purportedly of other well known security pros the scam was designed to expose the trust that even some of the most skeptical internet users display on some of the most insecure sites on the web
2306844 moyer and hamiel said they did it three times each time impersonating a different person each time they lured in more than 50 new friends within 24 hours some of those people were chief security officers for major corporations and defense industry workers they said
2306845 ja die jungs waren schon sehr nerv s jeder hat das gro e ziel wm in kanada vor augen das wirklich allen viel bedeutet allerdings besserte es sich mit fortschreitender spielzeit und wir waren dann schon die bessere mannschaft im schlussdrittel ging die konzentration f r eine minute verloren trotz der zwei gegentore in dieser phase hat aber keiner den kopf h ngen lassen und es wurde weiter gearbeitet das spricht absolut f r die jungs vergessen sollte man auch nicht den fr hen zeitpunkt in der saison zu dem dieses turnier stattfindet morgen gegen die schweizer werden wir jedenfalls alles versuchen auch wenn die einen verdammt starken jahrgang haben
2306846 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
2306847 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
2306848 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
2306849 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
2306850 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
2306851 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
2306852 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
2306853 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
2306854 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
2306855 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
2306856 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
2306857 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
2306858 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
2306859 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
2306860 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
2306861 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
2306862 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
2306863 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2
2306864 large recording companies vs the defenseless some common sense solutions to the challenges of the riaa litigations
2306865 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
2306866 organizers feel that listening to concerns of the community that youre going into is something that we need to do because one of our biggest problems with the government is that they dont listen to us
2306867 so for us to not listen to what other people are saying would be completely hypocritical in light of that and in light of other events that have happened we have decided to move to a different permanent area

2306902 then when did you decide to play the race card
2306903 dont you call race and get upset about me being loud
2306904 stop and think about it before you call someone a racist
2306905 they were protecting the passengers they were protecting the crew they were protecting the plane
2306906 this is nothing more than attempted extortion dressed up in a lawsuit
2306907 v0 16 has a shiny new disk format and is not compatible with filesystems created by older btrfs releases but it should be the fastest btrfs yet with a wide variety of scalability fixes and new features
2306908 improved scalability and performance improvements include fine grained btree locking pushing cpu intensive operations such as checksumming into their own background threads improved
2306909 there are still more disk format changes planned but were making every effort to get them out of the way as quickly as we can you can see the major features we have planned on the
2306910 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2306911 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2306912 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2306913 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2306914 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2306915 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2306916 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2306917 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2306918 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2306919 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2306920 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2306921 many motorists simply dont see their two wheeled brethren or when they do find them aggravating
2306922 a motorist and cyclist came to blows after the motorist berated the pedal pusher for ignoring a stop sign
2306923 the enraged cyclist used his bike to batter the motorists car until a bystander punched him
2306924 in los angeles it takes a special kind of road warrior to hop on a bike in the name of saving the planet and a little money
2306925 tensions between cyclists and motorists here have become dangerously combative
2306926 a lot of motorists think cyclists should get off the road
2306927 i dont know if its just my personality or my game
2306928 but we were pretty busy because we had an outing today so it was hard to keep up
2306929 he got to go to the british so his mother gets to be with him this week
2306930 obviously i havent had success at augusta but the u s open british open and this one i feel suit my game quite well
2306931 ive heard a lot of comments this week from anywhere to hes wearing a lions jersey so theres no way he can win because of the luck of the lions
2306932 error subscription could not be added please check the url and try again
2306933 it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
2306934 they might win this week who knows thats the kind of year theyve had theyve been able to surprise you when you least expect it
2306935 we can only hope that we can win a couple more and just get further ahead of the competition when the final 10 starts
2306936 the bonus points that he has right now i think thats the only advantage he has
2306937 they just havent shown to me what they were showing earlier in the season but going into it with a 70 or a 40 point deficit which is kind of where were at right now thats a lot of points to try to make up when you havent been able to have the dominating wins like we had last year
2306938 having a string like weve had here winning four of the nine years ive been here thats something that were really really proud of
2306939 i mean batting 300 will get you in the baseball hall of fame and were over 400 right now at the glen
2306940 the glens elevation changes and slight banking in the turns should keep the water from standing and provide the drivers with challenging conditions
2306941 but we dont necessarily look toward that what we look toward right now is making our car the best that we can make it so we can be a contender in the race
2306942 these two david carr and anthony wright have gone head to head since camp began and there is certainly evidence as of last night that the competition is bringing out the best in both of them and it is highly competitive
2306943 i told myself before the game to try to have fun relax and enjoy the game
2306944 a lot of things have happened to me over the last couple of years i was just trying to go out there and make some plays and see what happened after that its not that ive lost confidence in myself but you always wonder if you can go out and still do this it was good to go out there and feel comfortable that was the biggest thing
2306945 you see the performance and you visualize his further development and how he can help you as he goes on
2306946 they have not been as sharp as they should be and i think hopefully well get some reaction to that this week
2306947 there were opportunities to establish some things at the point of attack that had some success but not enough
2306948 it could have been better you can go right down the line they all played and they all had opportunities that position can play better
2306949 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2306950 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2306951 the usga was proud to call orville moody an open and senior open champion
2306952 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour
2306953 the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2306954 were in the process of getting it all signed and everything and thats all i can say right now
2306955 but when we scanned him friday we discovered that the horse had bowed a tendon
2306956 if you want to slot him somewhere you just do it and leave him alone
2306957 archipenko is a pretty special horse its a tough bunch of horses
2306958 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2306959 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2306960 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2306961 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2306962 upon the conclusion of our investigation the big ten is secure in its belief that these games were not compromised
2306963 as a result of this review we have made several adjustments to our background check program
2306964 whether its hitting a 490 yard par 4 in two when its into the wind and just take that as hey i played a great hole or its one round at a time one hole at a time
2306965 to shoot under par today was pretty solid i certainly would have taken that when i went to bed last night
2306966 its just one good round and obviously this weekend is going to get tougher and tougher
2306967 i was just scoring a little bit better than they were
2306968 the balls rolling out which is good for shorter hitters like myself
2306969 its not playing so long as it did when i first got here early in the week but now trying to pull the right club to get the right bounce to get the ball in the fairway is key youre not going to be able to score at all out of the rough
2306970 i hit some good shots and when i didnt i recovered well i hung in there i knew it was going to be tough right from the first hole and i just hung in there all day and i hit some really good bunker shots around the greens capitalized on a couple of good iron shots that i hit in
2306971 i just had a good solid day one of those days in a major championship where you just grind it out
2306972 couldnt hurt amp helip we kind of know each other and what to say what not to say
2306973 but i think that if we finish second the management will certainly not kill me
2306974 you will not hear one word out of anyone about 2007
2306975 im not looking for toe in the water type of players
2306976 im looking for players that arent waiting to see how things go theyre going to be part of making things go
2306977 im going to do everything i can to make sure last year doesnt happen again
2306978 of course its going to be in the back of some of our heads as some sort of motivation
2306979 but its not something were dwelling on its not something were constantly reflecting back on
2306980 no judge is going to order the vandal back on the water tower to clean up the mess nor is a judge likely to order a vandal to climb a sign that hangs over the freeway
2306981 i dont know if its just my personality or my game
2306982 but we were pretty busy because we had an outing today so it was hard to keep up
2306983 he got to go to the british so his mother gets to be with him this week
2306984 obviously i havent had success at augusta but the u s open british open and this one i feel suit my game quite well
2306985 ive heard a lot of comments this week from anywhere to hes wearing a lions jersey so theres no way he can win because of the luck of the lions
2306986 im very happy and relieved to have a deal in place that will keep me with andretti green for a long time
2306987 weve been very good together since the start of 2003 and i believe we can continue to be good for many more years
2306988 john and matt have done an excellent job i just want to be a guy who can make a contribution
2306989 i kept working hard and good things have been happening its just gotten to the point where i got an opportunity here
2306990 it was a small injury it wasnt really a big deal
2306991 it was a minor muscle strain so i was fortunate in that sense im just glad that i got back on track and was able to get back here and help the team out
2306992 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2306993 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2306994 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2306995 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2306996 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2306997 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2306998 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2306999 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2307000 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2307001 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2307002 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2307003 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2307004 there are very few players who left me against my will
2307005 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2307006 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2307007 the specialist he saw yesterday is delighted with the progress
2307008 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time
2307009 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2307010 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it thats what it really boils down to
2307011 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2307012 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is i keep searching for it i cant find that half a tenth i just need more seat time
2307013 we qualified well at sonoma and we led at the beginning but we didnt race in traffic like we wanted to
2307014 this race here is very important for the points but its more of a personal challenge for myself and crew chief chad knaus its a race that were looking at to help us down the road we want to get out of here with a decent finish
2307015 every great driver wants to feel like they can win at every track they go to
2307016 jimmie is an awesome driver he proves it every weekend hes in the same equipment that im in so i can appreciate it moreso than a lot of people can
2307017 road courses are not easy to win on i feel like theyve had some opportunities to win and they havent worked out hes been getting better and better when we go test hes usually faster than me i feel like its just a matter of time more than anything
2307018 the crazy thing is i do better in these other vehicles than i do in the cup car i just have to figure out how
2307019 it just shows how hard it is to stay on top weve put a lot of hard work in and have established ourselves as a contender
2307020 i never thought i would win at richmond and finally conquered that track it would be extremely satisfying to win at watkins glen
2307021 as much as we can talk about what our cars are doing and what were looking for in setups we do all that we can there
2307022 but when you get in the car and youre looking for a half a tenth of a second per corner and it totals up to a three or four tenths advantage from start to finish of a lap its really tough to communicate those things
2307023 its such a small difference its just a little everywhere i just need to do it more
2307024 when they were in their heyday byu was winning conference championships year in and year out
2307025 theres not one player thats satisfied nor a coach thats satisfied
2307026 ideally the last game of the year comes down to the conference championship
2307027 if you could write the script thats how youd want to write it
2307028 no seriously ask me if i play basketball im talking to you dont you walk away from me motherf man i will hunt you down and beat the question out of you if you dont get back over here and ask me if i play basketball
2307029 look at that little french flopping punk id bodyslam him if i ever saw him
2307030 you must be this tall to hoop on this court
2307031 hell yeah man youre a tall guy and youre well youre tall i mean come
2307032 youre right i am tall im gonna go buy some nike air maxes and try out for the lakers thanks total stranger
2307033 his quickness put a lot of pressure on me and forced me to make a couple of errors
2307034 the ball moves slower which gives me more time to set up
2307035 at the end i thought i could break back i thought i could take the set
2307036 hopefully this result will help me out in the future with easier draws and hopefully i can reach the finals again
2307037 he played pretty well in the second set when i was up 5 3 and vieyra threatened a comeback i got worried his forehand moves around and it kept me on my defence
2307038 it was hard with the rain but i just tried to keep my focus i tried not too worry too much about it
2307039 all mighty and sometimes overrated singapore on top of the world and whats beneath the surface

2307043 megan claimed she felt threatened by macy but that dog was a sweetheart she wouldnt hurt a fly
2307044 brian adored macy and refused to give her up for the longest time but megan nagged him about it until he finally gave in he was crushed
2307045 whenever brian went out of town hed board macy at the training school
2307046 the trainers were shocked when brians assistant came in one day and said brian was being forced to give macy up for adoption because megan didnt get along with her
2307047 right after brian gave macy up for adoption megan adopted two tiny dogs
2307048 is a largely unreported war in terms of useful unclassified reporting by governments and nato
2307049 the afghan government provides little or no useful data nato has a long history of vacuous ministerial declarations
2307050 the afghan and other governments have failed to communicate robustly and honestly with their populations in a way that would help build and sustain popular will for a long term endeavour
2307051 our analysis suggests there is no battlefield solution to terrorism military force is usually too blunt an instrument the use of substantial us military power also runs the risk of turning the local population against the government by killing civilians
2307052 this means a light us military footprint or none at all
2307053 the us military can play a critical role in building indigenous capacity but should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in muslim societies since its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment
2307054 sir would it be fair to say you dont know how many officers you have working here
2307055 my question to you sir is what is your plan to defend the district
2307056 my plan is to enforce the law im not very familiar with the villages or which villages are vulnerable and i dont have a plan but i think we should ambush the taliban

2307061 i wouldnt mind meeting you everyday for the rest of my life
2307062 thats why they should give him his own show since denises show is facing cancellation
2307063 a great satisfaction of growing old one of many is assuming the role of witness to the wobbling of the world and seeing irreversible changes the downside besides listening to the delusions of the young is hearing the same hackneyed opinions over and over the discoveries that are not new the proposed solutions that will solve nothing
2307064 one thin necked unsmiling girl with pale skin and a fragile body narrow shoulders and no breasts tried shyly turning sideways to catch my eye was i imagining that she was twisting a little stuffed toy in her hand
2307065 most people on earth are poor most places are blighted and nothing will stop the blight getting worse there are too many people a great number of them spend their hungry days thinking about america the world is deteriorating and shrinking to a ball of bungled desolation only the old can really see how badly the world is aging and all that weve lost
2307066 it has been quite a challenge and long over due the legacy website application had fallen into disrepair and manual intervention for user revisions to job postings and resumes had become necessary the community programs and informational aspect of the online application also suffered from an overcrowded interface that led to user confusion in navigating the website
2307067 providing less confusion within the application interface and an enhanced focus on ease of use and efficiencies will provide a higher degree of creditable search returns for users should an employer have specific need of finding a candidate with special skills education certifications or languages as an example they can easily bring forward search returns of potential applicants for employment consideration
2307068 we have always placed an emphasis on returning expatriated montanans come home montana has been one of our most successful programs and has garnered enthusiasm and direct community participation across the state it is our intent to revitalize this program and others with the planned redesign of the community portal scheduled for public release early in 2009
2307069 we have many highly credentialed people looking for career positions in montana global interest is also seen in resumes posted by european professionals who are looking for opportunities here we are very hands on will go the extra mile to introduce job matching opportunities to employers and job seekers
2307070 we are happy to accommodate everyone every job in montana is vitally important and every employee is the blood that pumps the heart of our economy montana jobs network exists for everyone we dedicate ourselves and our services to montanans those resident expatriated and those new employers and job seekers who will come to contribute to our communities in the future
2307071 the original application we developed years ago had the ability and it was our intent then to charge administrative fees to offset costs and help sustain our programs and applications however our advisory group and a few influential montana business enterprises thought we might do well to seek out private and publicly available funding to subsidize our services given this direction montana jobs network has been providing all services without cost it was also implied early on that we should in time wean ourselves from the dependency of discretionary funding sources and implement administrative fee based income to help sustain montana jobs network in past years we have had generous donations from first interstate bank and davidson companies we have received in kind contributions from rightnow technologies and have had the benefit of grant funding provided through a usda rural business enterprise grant for development of mbc101 montana business culture core skills and training a grant recived from the qwest foundation made it possible for the development and deployment of come home montana these resources together with many other contributing businesses organizations and individuals helped make our programs successful within communities across montana organizations public and private such as the state of montana governors office of economic development bear paw development corp mid rivers communications montana world trade center montana chamber of commerce montana associated technology roundtables matr montana economic developers association meda the university of montana alumni association the montana state university alumni association bozeman and many others have all played important supporting roles leading to the success of montana jobs network the mission of montana jobs network is in part to provide comprehensive and user friendly resources that will aid in the job selection hiring training and the subsequent retention of a highly qualified and desirable work force within montana secondary to that objective but no less important are the efforts made to assist in providing entrepreneurial opportunities within montana and to stimulate and grow our economy
2307072 the montana jobs network career portal provides real benefits to the montana employer and to job seekers everywhere however should an employer feel they have not realized any value in their membership we are happy to refund their membership and any current service related fee paid we will ask them why they were dissatisfied but only so that we can improve or correct any aspect of our programs and services that may not be working as they should
2307073 this employer event is a great window of opportunity for employers wishing to participate

2307129 the other three are top notch goalies but not only that there are a lot of goalies that arent here
2307130 im given an opportunity now to show what i got and its important come the season i have to start off well because when you look at the past jeff glass 2005 and justin pogge 2006 werent even invited to this summer camp and wound up as starting goalies right now im competing against the three here but come the regular season its against all the goalies across the chl
2307131 they really stress the team unity here white against red
2307132 its exciting im sure itll be a good battle on the ice its going to keep the intensity up pretty high

2307138 im thrilled with the amount of community support we are seeing
2307139 it always amazes me to see just how much the tri city community continues to support and give to those kids and families dealing with autism
2307140 its a lot more difficult for a child with autism
2307141 when they finally speak their first word or say i love you it really hits home its an emotion you cant describe unless youve gone through it theres an unconditional love with these children they are very special im fortunate to have a son like carson
2307142 it doesnt matter if its 1 or 20 000 every dollar is vital
2307143 the big foundations like autism speaks are obviously more into the research part of it where as the carson kolzig foundation is more into the support of families that are affected now and we can help them now weve got very very generous people people who want to do their part no dollar goes unnoticed
2307144 autism is destructive in so many ways thats a big reason we started this foundation
2307145 obviously the child is most important but it really affects the family i think the divorce rate is 80 percent for couples with an autistic child a lot of it is financial burden we are fortunate with my career but wed like to help out families who are less fortunate
2307146 for the size of this community its incredible olie and i have gone through this the last six years with our wives we lean on each other there are tough days and great days playing hockey together and against each other we use each other as a support system because we understand each other throw in the autism and that has made our friendship stronger
2307147 his cause is a great cause and they put on a first class tournament it has touched me personally through my family they have two children who are autistic beautiful kids very smart but its something we have to find a cure for
2307148 zach is a skilled d man who likes to rush the puck he is a very good skater with good puck skills and plays a physical game

2307150 i would love to be able to provide you with more information but according to kamloops blazers gm craig bonner the whl placed a gag order on all involved while everyone knows the regular season will open on sept 19 western conference teams arent allowed to provide the name of their opponent until sometime friday when the league apparently is going to issue a release involving home openers i am taking the day off kind of placing a gag order on myself if you will so there wont be any information here whoops there was one leak the seattle thunderbirds will be in prince george for a sept 19 and 20 doubleheader with the cougars the whl apparently will release its entire schedule on aug 7

2307159 customers that might have been looking to buy a new boat a year ago are now looking to do up their current model
2307160 were in fact doing a very good business for people who want a new mast or rigging rather than buying a new boat altogether
2307161 were probably 20 down on corporate hospitality side of things but thats been made up by sailing enthusiasts booking the boats as individuals
2307162 you would expect that these regattas would be hit hard but because there are so many sailors within the companies there are still plenty of entries for this year
2307163 you get everything from people who go to the formal balls and drinks parties right through to people who are sleeping on their boats and going for a few drinks in the beer tents at the end of the week
2307164 were seeing a trend in sailing towards chartering rather than owning boats
2307165 if you own a boat you have to pay to maintain it and keep it berthed

2307170 ive had the t shirt for ages and i wear it a lot so my boyfriend came up with a whistle when we went to the beach for me to pose we did do a lot of mouth to mouth on each other but it wasnt resuscitation it was stimulation there were some boats around and a few people on the beach so im sure they saw what i was doing i loved that my boyfriend buys newcummers all the time and we look at each issue together debating about which girls wed like to have join us in his bed
2307171 id really like to have a threeway with another girl and obviously my guy loves the idea
2307172 i was simply astounded by tiana on a scale of 1 to 10 i rate her a perfect 20 yes 20 its hard to believe this stunning woman is only 19 years of age she has it all a gorgeous face with those huge mischievous expressive eyes flawless complexion full red kissable lips and her slender seductive perfectly proportioned statuesque supple body covered with that beautiful rose pink flower petal soft smooth skin in addition to the class poise and confidence of a mature woman in fact she seems too perfect to be a woman more like a magnificent heavenly goddess i look forward to seeing more of her as soon as possible
2307173 well its kinda true but i have tried cock since ive been on summer vacation in miami ive totally been on the cock train im from northern florida and the guys up there are so blah but down here in miami the guys are totally sexy this was the first time id ever really been sexually attracted to the male sex so i figured it was time to finally lose my virginity i cant believe i even waited this long
2307174 i think i like them about the same pussy was my first love so no matter how many guys i fuck i will never lose my lezzie tendencies sometimes i just get a craving to smell and eat a juicy twat but i also really like it when a guy with a giant pecker sticks it deep in my pussy it feels better than when a girl fucks me with a dildo nothing compares to the real thing

2307177 no evidence for the argument made by the government business and many others that net immigration immigration minus emigration generates significant economic benefits for the existing uk population immigration has very small impacts on gdp per capita whether these impacts are positive or negative
2307178 in the short term immigration creates winners and losers in economic terms the biggest winners include immigrants and their employers in the uk consumers may also benefit from immigration through lower prices the losers are likely to include those employed in low paid jobs and directly competing with new immigrant workers this group includes some ethnic minorities and a significant share of immigrants already working in the uk
2307179 immigration has had a small negative impact on the lowest paid workers in the uk and a small positive impact on the earnings of higher paid workers
2307180 there is a clear danger that immigration has some adverse impact on training opportunities and apprenticeships offered to british workers
2307181 for european employers and skilled workers unskilled immigration brings real advantages it provides labour for their restaurants building sites and car parks and helps to keep these services cheap by keeping down the wages of those who work there but for unskilled europeans it is a mixed blessing it depresses their wages and may affect their job opportunities already unskilled workers are four times more likely to be unemployed than skilled workers and it is not surprising that they worry
2307182 the home office estimates that around 120 000 workers entered the uk from the new member countries of the european union between may 2004 and march 2005 that is not far short of the average annual increase in the labour force over the past decade without this influx to fill the skill gaps in a tight labour market it is likely that earnings would have risen at a faster rate putting upward pressure on the costs of employers and ultimately inflation private sector regular pay growth has been subdued which is somewhat puzzling in the context of 30 year high employment rates and 30 year low unemployment rates which we would usually associate with a tight labour market it is possible indeed likely that inflows of migrant labour have eased labour market pressure
2307183 the flow of workers from the a8 and the a2 the ten eastern european countries admitted to the eu since may 2004 appear to have increased the fear of unemployment which tends to have a downward impact on pay especially in the non union sector the fear of unemployment refers to the probability of a worker losing their job and may increase if the competition for jobs rises for instance through immigration or the threat of greater outsourcing to lower cost economies both these channels can be used to explain an increase in the fear of unemployment in the uk since the accession of the a8 nations in may 2004 consistent with a rise in the fear of unemployment wage growth has been depressed in both the uk and ireland since a8 accession according to the uk average earnings index excluding bonuses wage growth has fallen from 4 2 in 2004 to 3 9 in 2005 3 8 in 2006 and 3 5 in 2007q2 average weekly earnings growth in ireland has fallen from 5 0 in 2004 to 3 1 in 2006 given the strong growth rates of both economies many economists have struggled to find an explanation for this apparent weakness i believe a rise in the fear of unemployment is the only realistic candidate explanation
2307184 an easing in wage growth has helped to offset inflationary pressures emanating in other areas of the economy such as increases in the prices of energy and food immigration has therefore helped the monetary policy committee to hit its inflation target
2307185 although clearly benefiting employers immigration that is in the best interest of individual employers is not always in the best interest of the economy as a whole
2307186 not actually running british immigration policy in the exclusive interests of the british business community
2307187 stop immigration and you stop building houses schools hospitals roads and offices in the uk
2307188 business must make the case for quality and controlled immigration
2307189 no migrant from the eu accession states can claim state benefits until they have been here for 12 months they must work or go home
2307190 some employers and agencies imposed various charges on immigrants salaries thus reducing their pay below the minimum wage our concern is to avoid the development of a specific demand for immigrant workers that is based on immigrants lower expectations about wages and employment conditions or on a preference for labour whose freedom of employment in the uk is constrained by the workers immigration status
2307191 because immigration expands the overall economy it cannot be expected to be an effective policy tool for significantly reducing vacancies vacancies are to a certain extent a sign of a healthy labour market and economy they cannot be a good reason for encouraging large scale labour immigration
2307192 unambiguously untrue in the long run and for the economy as a whole
2307193 immigration lowers vacancies and relieves job and skill shortages despite record immigration there has been no change in the number of vacancies in a flexible labour market vacancies and the number of jobs adapt to the size of the labour force
2307194 we estimate that recent immigration has raised the gdp per head of the non migrant population by about 0
2307195 right wing consensus that immigration leads to job losses and lower wages
2307196 although the overall effect of migration on wages is positive wages at the low end of the wage distribution are held back while wages in the middle of the distribution increase
2307197 stunned to learn that there was simply no reliable source of information
2307198 no statistically significant impact of a8 migration on claimant unemployment either overall or for any identifiable subgroup in particular we find no adverse impacts on the young or low skilled nor do we find a statistically significant impact on wages either on average or at any point in the wage distribution although the evidence here is less complete
2307199 anecdotal evidence of non registration amongst some a8 migrants has been reported
2307200 we see no reason why such omissions should be systematic and they should therefore not bias the results
2307201 our estimates of the average impact on wages are not inconsistent with those found in dustmann the low pay commission paper although they are somewhat smaller
2307202 the generally poor labour market outcomes of low skilled natives in the uk do not reflect either a lack of available jobs structural factors in the labour market or a lack of formal qualifications since a8 migrants find it relatively easy to find employment but rather issues around basic employability skills incentives and motivation
2307203 we should not seek to shift the blame for our own social shortcomings on to hard working migrants
2307204 the government is clear that carefully controlled economic migration emphasis added benefits both our economy and our exchequer
2307205 the committee notes and we agree that migration can keep down inflationary pressure in the labour market
2307206 the evidence so far suggests that overall immigration has had few adverse effects on the labour market performance of the uk born workforce though this average may disguise some negative effects in the low wage market and positive effects in the higher wage labour markets
2307207 for the first time since they began arriving en masse four years ago more uk based poles are returning to their homeland than are entering britain
2307208 two years ago i could make five times the amount of money here than i could in poland now the wages are about the same and the living costs in the uk are much higher there is a lot of work in poland probably more than in the uk its a good time to go back
2307209 either work is done at competitive rates here or it is not done here at all
2307210 the chancellor has ack now ledged the need for the uk to compete with the tax regimes in other developed countries the challenge for government now is to get a grip on public spending so as to create the headroom that will be needed for further tax cuts in the years ahead
2307211 whos going to invest there wales now theyll look at the headlines and go to ireland instead i can tell you now that i know of more than one company that has already made that decision
2307212 workers in the uk have the lowest sense of job security out of employees in 18 of the worlds leading economies a bi annual survey has found some 24 2 of british workers think it is very probable or somewhat probable that they will lose their job over the next 12 months
2307213 ernst amp youngs annual discretionary income study showed that after tax contributions and monthly household bills the average family has just under 20 of its gross income left over compared with 28 in 2003
2307214 immigration is one of many factors contributing to more demand for housing and higher house prices we note the forecasts that if current rates of net immigration persist 20 years hence house prices would be over 10 higher than what they would be if there were zero net immigration
2307215 the level of unemployment benefits rose substantially compared to pay and eligibility for benefit became more relaxed unemployment as well as being less likely was also less costly financially to those affected thus reducing the pressure to take the first job that became available regardless of conditions employment protection legislation against arbitrary dismissal and generally limiting employer prerogatives over hiring and firing was also extended in this period another very significant gain for workers was a sharp fall in average hours worked from around 2000 per year in 1950 to 1750 in 1973 the equivalent of more than half a day less work per week
2307216 within the capitalist epoch one can distinguish five distinct phases of development
2307217 there has not been a gap between the rich and poor on the current scale ever in history it is unstable sooner or later there will be popular outrage and a political response
2307218 average per capita growth rate among developing countries has fallen from around three per cent p
2307219 the plain fact is that the neo liberal policy reforms have not been able to deliver their central promise namely economic growth when they were implemented we were told that while these reforms might increase inequality in the short term and possibly in the long run as well they would generate faster growth and eventually lift everyone up more effectively than the interventionist policies of the early postwar years had done the records of the last two decades show that only the negative part of this prediction has been met income inequality did increase as predicted but the acceleration in growth that had been promised never arrived so we have an apparent paradox here at least if you are a neo liberal economist all countries but especially developing countries grew much faster when they used bad policies during the 1960 1980 period than when they used good ones during the following two decades
2307220 periodicals are inherently conservative conservatism is bad therefore periodicals are bad or not worth reading or not taking seriously
2307221 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my will
2307222 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2307223 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2307224 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2307225 the specialist he saw yesterday is delighted with the progress
2307226 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time
2307227 were happy he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed he is a manchester united player
2307228 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2307229 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2307230 definitely hes going to stay with us the coach bernd schuster has said he wants him in our team
2307231 we dont see any possibility of him leaving real madrid
2307232 we know chelsea have been interested in signing him hes one of the best players we have got in our team we need him for the next season
2307233 robinho is very angry with the way the madrid bosses are dealing with him
2307234 he calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me about his future and i always have to tell him that no one has called
2307235 i have been trying to speak with someone from the club for three days robinho does not understand what is going on
2307236 his ambition is to become the best player in the world but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
2307237 he didnt like at all the idea of being fourth choice in the plans madrid have had this summer
2307238 first they wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo but couldnt their second option was rafael van der vaart third is valencia striker david villa robinho is fourth
2307239 robinhos plan was to play for real madrid for many years
2307240 when he scored 25 goals the season before no one thought he could do better than that but i felt he could
2307241 i expected him to improve just as i expect him to improve next season
2307242 of course we are at a different level twenty five goals against 42 is totally different so if he only gets to 41 i will forgive him i am sure he will have a great season
2307243 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2307244 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2307245 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2307246 as time goes on i also feel they begin to take on a role of older statesmen
2307247 you have people like gary neville paul scholes and ryan giggs rio ferdinand now has a big influence on the dressing room and so does edwin van der sar they are experienced players who have been through it all
2307248 it is not easy for young people coming from another country
2307249 it does not matter where they go they have to settle in and get used to another culture then they need to get used to the dressing room
2307250 it doesnt just happen overnight but eventually we hope all the players settle to have great careers here
2307251 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2307252 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2307253 they must be around 18 months or the companies wouldnt have made the investment
2307254 oh and the thing about my back is that its located on my cock
2307255 oh and the thing about my mailbox is that its located on my cock
2307256 oh and the thing about the harlem globetrotters is that its located on my cock
2307257 oh and the thing about global warming is that its located on my cock
2307258 oh and the thing about that dangling participle is that its located on my cock

2307261 hunter has said that the father of her child is former edwards campaign official andrew young the 41 year old married father of three has also said he is the father
2307262 are we supposed to believe that both the mother and the father a married father of three are lying to protect edwards
2307263 and al shame on you for spreding this all over the airwaves you dont know if its true wait and see you cant be that hard up for news we have enough juicy stuff here in delaware that we know is true
2307264 if we believed everything in the enquirer we would believe that george war bush and laura are divorcing that she spends time at the watergate hotel when he is on a binge
2307265 if any of that were true the right wing media would loved to have spilled that while he was running for president or anytime thereafter
2307266 we have enough juicy stuff here in delaware that we know is true

2307279 being uncooperative only gives them fuel to proceed at a faster pace our best weapons are to take away their weapons dont be combative
2307280 what i havent been able to figure out is a way to force the system to obey the laws
2307281 the department can develope its own rules and procedures to accomplish this
2307282 no what i am saying is exactly what i said which
2307283 your honor id like it entered into record that i feel the council for the state or whoever is being abusive and is in violation of my civil right by creating a hostile environment and imparing my right to a fair trial hearing

2307296 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2307297 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2307298 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2307299 it is important that these cases go forward at the pace that justice requires
2307300 prosecutors cannot should not accelerate cases but should try them with as much dispatch as they can recognizing that timely justice is appropriate both for the accused and society

2307311 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
2307312 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
2307313 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene
2307314 it is clear that this is the tip of the iceberg
2307315 the hypothesis they tested was reasonable but they only tested one gene
2307316 our study documented that hrt might be considered a useful tool to identify heart failure patients at high risk of death including high risk of dying suddenly
2307317 hrt may help physicians more effectively manage heart failure patients by indicating the need for more frequent follow up visits at specialized heart failure units and more intensely applied therapy including icd implantation in high risk patients
2307318 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2307319 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
2307320 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older

2307381 the peak sales month for the year was strikingly weak with a 12 3 year over year decline as the decline in demand for residential housing slumps through its third year its important to consider the significance of the extent of the decline it is very likely that we are now seeing the spiraling feedback effect of sharply declining prices and both the palpable sense and actual effects of recession and higher energy prices all working to depress buyer confidence thereby causing continued declines in housing demand

2307389 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak

2307530 he claimed that hubae must always acquiesce to the hot love of the seonbae apparently in a korean marriage the male has an irrestible urge to have sex the traditional wife is modest and so resists the irrestible urge of the male who then seeks solace elsewhere
2307531 the chap then pulled out of his pocket a red gochu which he then held aloft and puncutated the air with rapid rabbitlike thrusts
2307532 63 years after the japanese occupation at least one korean has stopped blaming japan
2307533 but to me the is one aspect of japan that is still old fashioned
2307534 since when japan is a crypto fascist state a third world mentality with a third world economy but to call the country a democracy is surely monkeying with the truth
2307535 we live in the worlds 2nd strongest economy and it is a shame for me to see him like that theres no reason for anyone to be in such need here none japan is a rich country and it should take care of its citizens

2307543 adamw says july 25th 2008 at 6 12 pm jib japanese only have 2 names legally god knows why so if you have a middle name for your child you have to run them together but you can do one in kanji one in hiragana etc to get round it

2307553 id be happy to serve as a paid actor who rides past police stations and cooperates or not as directed with the trainees but these are officials making use of innocent people and foreigners at that for their kunren with small and large risks forced upon the innocent party
2307554 theyre using foreigners as guinea pigs to train police officers drug officers because japanese citizens would be outraged if this happened to themselves
2307555 the government is instituting term limits on academics first for foreigners to see what happens and if it goes well theyll extend it to everyone
2307556 and if his examples show japan is treating gaijin as guinea pig then by the same token i can cites similar examples to show for instance the u s is treating gaijin for that matter african americans as guinea pig
2307557 drawing from 1997 98 data state officials found that forty percent of traffic stops involved black and hispanic motorists who were only about thirteen percent of all drivers on the new jersey turnpike eighty percent of those arrested during traffic stops were people of color the profiling debate brought the problem of racial profiling to national attention led to the resignation of the states top police official and prompted state governments in new jersey and elsewhere to rewrite regulations to forbid police officers from singling out drivers because of their race or ethnicity

2307583 from the processes that we have observed to date there is no evidence of widespread problems with the quality of the marks at key stage 3 that would justify withholding publication of the provisional results at national level
2307584 the head of profession for statistics has decided to delay publication of provisional ks3 results at the local authority level until there is sufficient volume of data for every local authority in all three subjects to enable publication of a complete set of provisional results on a consistent basis for all local authorities
2307585 because of their smaller size local authority figures require a higher proportion of results than the national figures require to enable the production of reliable provisional results
2307586 a data processing issue has caused some subsequent records to indicate pupils as absent incorrectly
2307587 since then the intensive effort to complete outstanding marking and make results available to schools online has meant an increase in the numbers of pupils being flagged as absent by the computer system where some results for a school are still being processed
2307588 at most this affects 1 2 of the cohort in many cases these absence flags will represent genuine absent pupils but this can only be checked with schools when they re open in september
2307589 if the results are not now accurate enough to publish at a local authority level they should have been held back at a national level too
2307590 this announcement gives every impression of a government which understands that there are serious doubts about the key stage 3 test results but ministers are clearly too petrified to admit this
2307591 ministers have let down parents pupils heads and teachers and theres still no sign that they appreciate their direct responsibility for the fiasco

2307757 if believing the bible as the sole source of truth makes one a christian then by pure logic and common sense the followers of christ when he was on this earth including his original 12 apostles were all non christians take a minute to think how absurd that sounds
2307758 everybody wants that lights out one two three guy but the reality is theres maybe 10 of those out of 30 teams and to find one your probably going to have to go out and develop your own youre probably not going to be able to compete in free agency in a market like ours for that guy
2307759 adam miller we wont know for a year or two but maybe were going to be able to find someone with some experience theres 8 or 9 free agent closers in the market could rafael perez close i dont know masa kobayashi can he grow into that role i cant answer those questions thats why theres still a lot of time to take advantage of this season and get some answers
2307760 thats kind of a sore subject for me because i think jhonny gets kind of beat up unjustly i think the reason why is the easiest tool to identify in the game is speed and so guys see a guy that they look for a shortstop and they think it should be a guy who can run fast but jhonny is as dependable and reliable on the average play as any ss in the game he doesnt have exceptional range but he makes the plays he needs to make and hes developing into a hitter who has some tremendous ceiling though i do think his body is so big hes going to outgrow that position at some point but that point may be two three four years down the road im not sure
2307761 its a different position it requires different reactions and skills he does have enough arm to play third base his hands should be good enough but what kind of range hell have over there you dont know put it this way in the list of things we have to deal with that is so far down there so were not going to get into that one
2307762 its hard to see any scenario where he is not one of the top six of seven coming into next year hes struck out more guys and gotten better at every level hes gone up its very rare that that happens and when it does its a guy whos tasting the big leagues he can see it in his sites hes got that killer instinct he keeps upping his game and upping his level his stuff right now is as good as its ever been hes a guy that has a chance to help us next season either out of the gate or sometime during the season
2307763 i dont think weve done anything to impact our chances next year at all what we have done is replenished the upper levels of our system with both some ceiling and some depth we havent at all compromised our chances to win next season
2307764 we in hezbollah are honored to meet with you today in defense of a national pan arab and islamic cause which is to stand side by side with our brothers in sudan leadership and people this is because this beloved country is facing an ugly conspiracy to undermine its unity freedom and independence

2307779 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2307780 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2307781 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2307782 there are already two busloads of fighters leaving for tskhinvali every day they give you a uniform on the way and you get issued with weapons once you arrive if i didnt have three children id have gone
2307783 our ossetian brothers are dying if we get the call every man who can stand on two legs will go to fight
2307784 a nation is under bombardment in the land it has occupied for hundreds of years the world must not ignore this aggression
2307785 our men will stay and fight until the last drop of blood but our old people and children must be saved we are calling on the kremlin to intervene and create a humanitarian corridor for them to escape
2307786 this is americas doing they are supporting georgias mad lust for new land our land
2307787 i hope these guys in the government have a plan
2307788 there is a justification for this action in south ossetia but theyre taking on a huge monster called the kremlin lets just all pray for the best

2307802 georgian troop positions firing on tskhinvali and peacekeepers were suppressed by artillery fire and tank units of the 58th army which are outside the capital of south ossetia
2307803 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia this is a clear intrusion we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2307804 resistance in tskhinvali is mounting four georgian tanks have been hit on the railway station square
2307805 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is the logic behind the steps we are taking now we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished those guilty will receive due punishment
2307806 many russian volunteers intended to go to south ossetia and he said it was very difficult to maintain peace in the region
2307807 the only way to stop saakashvili is by bombing tbilisi
2307808 saakashvili with moral support from georgias foreign sponsors decided to begin this aggression

2307831 in certain areas like malia on crete bombes are a real problem
2307832 we may talk a lot about the attitude of tourists and their excessive drinking but often its the alcohol thats at fault if we dont solve this problem and get rid of bombes greeces image will be tainted
2307833 until now officials have only been able to conduct such checks until 2pm which is a bit of a paradox when its clearly such a big issue

2307841 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance

2307868 look when i was young and irresponsible i did irresponsible things then i found jesus and i dont do those things anymore my record has been dealt with lets move onto what is important im not going to play gotcha journalism with the press
2307869 why is everything that you did before you found jesus off the table john kerrys record before he was 40 isnt off the table
2307870 this isnt gotcha journalism sir this is regular journalism where we attempt to find out the truth about issues and see if the candidates are untruthful about their past as a way to gage their character
2307871 so are you telling me that the young and irresponsible period goes up to the age 40 do you apply the same standard to your opponent

2307873 kuwait is a sovereign nation and our country will not allow iraq to wage aggressive war to invade kuwaits territory or seize its oil wells
2307874 i have direct instructions from president bush to improve our relations with iraq we have considerable sympathy for your quest for higher oil prices the immediate cause of your confrontation with kuwait as you know i lived here for years and admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country we have no opinion on your arab arab conflicts such as your dispute with kuwait secretary of state james baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction first given to iraq in the 1960s that the kuwait issue is not associated with america
2307875 4moreyears said do you want to know why people are so concerned about kerrys vietnam record because he has made his record the cornerstone of his fight for the presidency kerry started this nobody else
2307876 white house blessed campaign strategists have been working quietly for months to compile potentially damaging background on all the democratic candidates
2307877 by the time the white house finishes with kerry no one will know what side of the vietnam war he fought on
2307878 one significant thing that can truly pave the way to a presidency
2307879 so the admin lets catgirl61 post all of stuff on bush but the admin doesnt let tommorrow man post stuff on kerry
2307880 tommorrow sic mans comments were removed because of length not politics
2307881 why is your arrest record not an issue no we didnt deal with this in the year 2000 we have new information about your arrest record and we would like you to confirm or deny it im allowed to make a claim if i have proof i have witnesses who were there i have affidavits
2307882 mr bush while govenor of texas you saw the passage of the three strikes and youre out sentencing guidelines for drug offenses if those guidelines had been in effect during the period of your youthful indescretions would you have served prison time
2307883 mr bush youve stated that the purpose of your no child left behind policies is to ensure that all children graduating from high school have in fact acheived the knowledge expected from that acheivement and that students have not been shuttled through have you ever been the beneficiary of being shuttles through requirements
2307884 mr bush one of the issues facing your presidency is holding corporate interests responsible for deceptive accounting practices while at harken energy you were part of the accounting committee of the board of directors were you ever aware of the accounting irregularities there
2307885 mr president why as commander in chief havent you attended a single funeral for any of the now almost 1200 military personnel that have died in the war in iraq

2307932 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2307933 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2308015 they eat every three hours and im getting better at holding them both for breast feeding at the same time so that helps usually the other kids come in and hold them when they finish they help with the baths and the changing
2308016 we try to get them to eat simultaneously for the sake of management but it gets a little crowded at the bar
2308017 your body is designed to handle breastfeeding twins or even triplets many moms have done it successfully
2308018 and with the right help and support you can reap double the rewards and might even have double the fun
2308019 prepare for breastfeeding like you would to run a race plan a wedding or interview for a job take a breastfeeding class and find local resources like lactation consultants and support groups
2308020 watch a friend breastfeed successfully to be truly awestruck we know of newborn twins who held hands while nursing
2308021 most mothers should be able to breastfeed their twins exclusively if they get off to a good start and get good support unfortunately a good start and good support are not always easy to get in most hospitals and most mothers are failed in their attempts having had a cesarean section should not be an obstacle it is often presented to be again with a good start and good support
2308022 for twins receiving the health and developmental benefits of breastfeeding are even more important because they tend to be premature and therefore at higher risk of infections
2308023 as long as youre pumping in lieu of a feeding at the breast your milk supply wont be hurt
2308024 nursing twins can be extremely rewarding but may be a bit trickier and take a little longer to master because many twins are early or smaller they may lack some stamina in the beginning you can give yourself a break by with pumping and giving bottles of expressed breastmilk particularly if you feel like the feedings are going on and on some moms even feed twin a on both breasts at a feeding and then pump while twin b gets a previously pumped bottle of expressed breastmilk then at the next feeding the twins switch
2308025 she probably started out one at a time to pay close attention to getting a good latch she most likely accomplishes simultaneous feedings using a twin football hold click for a photo with the top of their heads nearly touching curled around her with her legs pointing toward her back

2308040 and we do that throughout the season so i cant see any reason why next year would be a lot more money than it was this year to operate one of our cars
2308041 by demanding that so much be all alike nascar officials have diminished the quality of the racing

2308108 it has been an absolute pleasure working with cameron this year and to have achieved the success we have makes all the hard work and long hours well worth it he has been a great ambassador not only for tas racing but more so for suzuki and relentless we are already looking forward to 2009 where cameron will be joining us for a longer stay as we plan to start pre season testing that bit earlier with the all new k9 gsx r1000 suzuki our main goals will again be to excel at the three international road races but we have also planned a slightly bigger bsb role for cameron in 2009 details on this will be announced in the coming weeks

2308137 the best imagery from a fresh collection of high quality images chosen by us from flickrs diverse and prolific community
2308138 for us is not significant but its strategically extremely important
2308139 from our perspective on the flickr side were not expecting this will be a huge stream of monetization for our members the relationship in the licensing piece is purely between the photographer the flickr member and getty images itself
2308140 i think photographers would be much more concerned if 2 billion images from flickr would find their way into microstock
2308141 on the other hand photoshelter allows virtually any photographer to participate we sic allow them to determine which images they want to submit and set a licensing type and price point that suits their desires sic he would be getting a check for 5600 i e double what he would have received from getty had they even accepted his image in the first place

2308143 park admissions are expected to suffer this summer because of the economic outlook and related deferred investment in new rides and facilities
2308144 while the 25 to 44 year demographic and their kids have typically been the main visitors to theme parks the vast number of baby boomers entering retirement with plenty of spare time and money on their hands must not be neglected
2308145 over the four years to 2012 the 60 plus age group will experience an average annualized growth of 2 8 percent the strongest growth in all age categories
2308146 and theme parks may need to adjust their offering to appeal to older americans and foreign tourists too through shows musical activities and gentler rides
2308147 we are considering a number of concepts that will offer our guests a wide variety of food options
2308148 i had screws and plates placed in my left leg so i will need some rehab to get the strength back but i have recovered very well from my other injuries and the specialist is very happy with my progress
2308149 obviously i had some pretty serious injuries but i have returned home now and am on the road to a full recovery
2308150 there is a long way to go yet and how well the rehab progresses will play a big role in whether or not i ride again this year but i want to try and make it back for the final round or maybe ride at motogp in october
2308151 one thing i wont do is ride unless i am 100 its a long shot but if i can get the strength back in my leg we will just wait and see what happens as at the moment i am happy recovering at home
2308152 i owe a great deal of thanks to the suzuki racesafe team they were just brilliant and have continued to lend advice and support as i recover i also need to thank all the management and staff at phil tainton racing and suzuki australia for supporting my wife and i during this difficult time
2308153 like all within the bsb community we are deeply saddened at the loss of craig following his accident last weekend
2308154 the british championships formed a large part of craigs career and i know he kept a keen interest on them as we did with his world championship exploits
2308155 craig will perhaps be best remembered by his two years on the distinctive yellow valmoto triumph and who can forget

2308165 what do you know youre far too young to be giving me advice
2308166 this is my home dog which i have been rearing i killed it on demand of my spirits who directed me to offer its body parts to them
2308167 welcome to animal kingdom where man pikin dey show dog pepper
2308168 it is called south africa because behind those high walls youll find rich europeans and outside here is soweto where we ordinary masses struggle with dog meat
2308169 e dey protect person from all those nyama nyama disease them
2308170 eating dog meat gives you a special protection against the most potent juju charm
2308171 dog meat also improves your sex life and if you eat dog meat you cannot be poisoned
2308172 the very idea of eating dog meat is absolutely disgusting
2308173 the talk about dog meat curing diseases and giving protection against charms and the rest is mere superstition
2308174 people who eat dog meat only use those excuses to convince themselves that what they are doing is okay
2308175 besides i cannot eat dog meat because dogs are like pets
2308176 everybody is eating dog meat openly now that is why dogs are scarce
2308177 we have heard of people stealing dogs to sell our policy here in south africa is that we do not deal in stolen merchandise so we normally quiz our customers to be sure they are selling their own dogs
2308178 moreover south africa is not the only dog meat joint in abuja
2308179 people who eat dog meat have no business with malaria
2308180 so i was introduced to the meat as a cure for malaria and i can testify that it works
2308181 dog meat to the best of my knowledge is not any different from any other meat the claim that it cures malaria is definitely not true
2308182 it cannot be true either that it boosts human immunity
2308183 i hear they eat frogs in certain parts of the world but i tell you no matter how you cook or dress a frog i can never eat it
2308184 but dog is different so eating dog meat is a question of culture for me
2308185 oh la la you dont know what you are missing
2308186 any right thinking capitalist who had seen the wright brothers contraption take to the skies would have shot it down and saved investors 100 years of agony
2308187 against all the odds in 1981 my dream came true not only did i win a very public victory in the grand national but also a very personal victory against cancer
2308188 im still desperately chasing my first win this year but im confident it will come as weve been pretty consistent of late battling for the podium positions in the races
2308189 i came away from the last round quite frustrated as i really wanted to get another win
2308190 ive been training really hard over the past couple of weeks so im feeling in great shape that is going to be really important over these last few rounds of the championship
2308191 i will be wearing one of his actual helmets that he wore this season for the races and ill be proud to do so and i hope my results will make him proud of me im so fired up for this weekend i want wins nothing else
2308192 now and then in history one finds a time and a place that seems to be charmed where talent has assembled in a way that appears to defy all laws of probability
2308193 a triple helix of artistic technological and business struggles it shows how small things done well can lead to big things
2308194 it is very quiet here how on earth are you going to sleep
2308195 with the credit crunch starting to hit quality professional advice and also a vision of a better future are more important than ever thats why we have counsellors and life coaches as well as lawyers attending the show including a workshop with the best selling author and speaker nick williams

2308197 keith cooper a professional architectural photographer is offering to teach estate agents to take better house photos the credit crunch is slashing the number of people viewing properties and some agents are realising that taking better photos really will help get people through the door
2308198 a raw deal in a researchers eyes dispute over an invention highlights problems in technology transfer
2308199 the 2003 deal allowed allergan to reduce the royalties it was obliged to pay to the university in exchange for an upfront payment of 23 million and additional payments later
2308200 what was clear to me and clear to us is we had a huge opportunity to create content that were boys favorites
2308201 youre fighting the brand perception the very very strong brand equity thats been in the marketplace for many many years
2308202 it would almost require a completely separate effort to reach tween boys with a completely different name somehow associated with the disney property to reach these tween males
2308203 what we heard loud and clear is they expect from disney this broad array
2308204 they want a place essentially a headquarters for them where their favorite content exists that has this broad array of shapes and sizes and tenors and complexities and treats them with the respect that disney channel treats all kids and the girls are fanatical about
2308205 we know we have a huge opportunity to take that asset and make it every bit as powerful as disney channel or playhouse disney
2308206 radioheads in rainbows marked a paradigm shift for the music industry here was an established rock band free from its recording contract with emi delivering content directly to the consumer commencing on the 10th of october 2007 with a pay what you want downloadable album this was followed by a made to order deluxe box set and then concluded with a conventional cd and itunes release whilst the project has gathered unprecedented worldwide media coverage with much speculation on what the average price paid might have been there is another less intuitive but far more relevant question that has yet to be asked or answered that is did their offer of their album for free succeed in diverting traffic away from torrent sites and back towards their own venue of inrainbows com
2308207 anyone who has made it to the end of this paper and assumes that the project was a failure has missed two critical points firstly lots of people bought the album in any one of its three formats and lots of people went to see the show and the word lots is robust no matter which comparative measure you use secondly the wider purpose of this paper is in many ways echoing the tone of the recent article in the economist piracy is a bad thing but sometimes companies can use it to their advantage hopefully the reader will now be able to at least ask or ponder how many of those torrent users signalled a willingness to fork out 50 for a concert ticket which led to the second date being added at victoria park in london so did the offer of their album for free succeed in diverting traffic away from torrent sites our answer is yes but with a twist both torrents and legal downloads would appear to be complements not competitors think of the meaning of the term complements in the context of popularity where there is now a wealth of information and a poverty of attention the challenge of achieving popularity or attention when the old rules of scarcity and excludability dont apply to information goods the way they used to changes the monetisation game completely radiohead and their management undoubtedly got peoples attention with the information embedded in their unique offering in october regardless of whether those people were fans or not with that attention came consumption from those who were established fans and those who were just curious of that latter curious segment there will be a sizeable portion who were already locked on torrents and its plausible to suggest that it is largely this segment who didnt switch to inrainbows com the reverse logic is that the fans will have been made aware of the project and its intentions through radiohead com and will have been more likely to have switched but the ratio of radiohead fans who were converted from torrents to the total number of curious torrent users will be miniscule to complete the migraine the size of the total torrent market means that traffic which was displaced from the torrents to in rainbows will be overshadowed by a disproportionate uplift in additional curious torrent activity we argue that an awful lot of curious torrent users will have downloaded in rainbows without knowing of inrainbows com and would not have downloaded it otherwise had it not been for its unique media coverage and popularity the band are still on a phenomenally popular global tour which may act as a catalyst to eventually getting the conventional album sales past the two million mark and thats not accounting for all the significant pre 2008 activity so hopefully this report will have moved the current file sharing debate away from a simple zero sum game you were a pirate and are now a law abiding citizen to a rather more complex question of additionality and popularity in a market thats increasingly hard to define in a digital arena consumers go to venues where they feel comfortable and what weve learnt from the ambitious and admirable experiments of radiohead and nine inch nails is that a large part of that comfort is the ability to stay anonymous is there a trade off between gaining attention and acquiring information perhaps and if we can solve that then the question of monetisation can properly be addressed
2308208 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2308209 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2308210 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
2308211 trust me i have been doing this for 35 years i know how to protect prisoners
2308212 i respect the heck out of you for taking this case under all this scrutiny
2308213 my life has been revolutionarily transformed and its transforming in front of the eyes of these media people who dont know me at all
2308214 your honor i ask for your forgiveness it will never happen again
2308215 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior judge giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated
2308216 its a tragedy for the mayor his family and the city
2308217 the united states looks to all of our international partners to condemn this anti democratic action

2308221 if at first the idea is not absurd then there is no hope for it
2308222 the thing that drives me hazy am i the one whos crazy or are they
2308223 what i have found profoundly unsatisfactory and made my views clear in the course of argument is the fact that the parties have between them spent in the region of 100 000 arguing over a claim which is worth about 6 000
2308224 in the florid language of the argument i regarded them one or other if not both of them as
2308225 at the time of writing this judgment i rightly do not know whether any or if so what attempts have been made to settle this case and the remarks that follow are of general application
2308226 i raise that matter again in this judgment to make the point as firmly as i can that this is a paradigm case which if it could not have been settled by the parties themselves customer and dealer then it behoved both solicitors to take the firmest grip on the case from the first moment of instruction
2308227 that i appreciate may not always be easy but perhaps a copy of this judgment can at the first meeting be handed to the client bristling with righteous indignation in this case the customer who has paid a small fortune for a motor car which does not meet his satisfaction and the dealer anxious to preserve the reputation of his prestige product
2308228 feelings are running high early positions are taken positions become entrenched the litigation bandwagon will roll on experts are inevitably involved and before one knows it there will be two three day trial and even heaven help them an appeal
2308229 at the time this dispute crystallised the car was practically brand new
2308230 the cost of such a mediation would be paltry by comparison with the costs that would mount from the moment of the issue of the claim
2308231 mediation is a perfectly proper adjunct to litigation the skills are now well developed the results are astonishingly good try it more often
2308232 fantasy is incredibly powerful and if not confused with reality ought to be harmless
2308233 f irst the clintons sic and now edwards no wonder barack went on vacation now he probably was told that this would break this week
2308234 a human being is liable to do anything i never put anyone on a pedestal
2308235 when i was young i hero worshiped jfk as the perfect person president husband dad imagine my chagrin great when i found out he was also a huge cheat and made a fool out of his wife
2308236 mostly outrage is being expressed here about john edwards admission of having an affair
2308237 i dont really care what he does in his private life but he chose to be a presidential candidate cheating on a wife with cancer and then running for the democratic nomination with that fact tucked away waiting to break out as an october surprise not only is that an incredibly selfish act but he could have single handedly given us another 8 years of republican rule if he won the primaries his hubris makes my blood boil to think that he ran with this thinking he wouldnt endanger not just the presidency but this country too is just repulsive
2308238 self serving egomaniac with a distinct lack of moral fiber
2308239 he had an affair then asked us to nominate him
2308240 most major news organizations including the washington post did not report the allegations against edwards because of a lack of corroboration
2308241 but a debate has swirled on internet sites and on fox news over whether media outlets were protecting the former senator either out of bias toward a democrat or sympathy for his wife
2308242 after having suffered the serious loss with john kerry in 2004 and not being able to make any significant headway this year in the democratic primaries hes finished what this does is pour the dirt on top of the grave really
2308243 the immediate significance is it seriously tarnishes his reputation because he has presented himself as a clean politician a fresh image politician and this of course seriously undercuts that
2308244 there are a couple of things to point out here sen edwards presented himself as a clean politician someone who was clean in every respect bill clinton never pretended that thats the first difference
2308245 he will obviously need to have a major moment with the media
2308246 people have become a bit hardened to these major moments and politicians admitting to extramarital affairs i think that people will say heres another one you cant trust these people what edwards has done is contribute to the continuing rise of distrust in america
2308247 its going to be news for at least a cycle or two possibly longer but there are so many events that will likely overtake it in the contest between obama and republican presidential candidate sen john mccain including the selection of vice presidential nominees i dont think this will have any lasting effect
2308248 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal
2308249 sponging slappers and young widowers have money stolen by incompetent ff uckers
2308250 freedom is the glue of the worlds strongest alliances and it is also the solvent that has dissolved tyrannical rule
2308251 lady mcmahon is part of a growing contingent of affluent consumers purchasing luxury fakes

2308254 ability to experience and integrate meaning and purpose into life through connectedness with self others art music literature and or a power greater than oneself that can be strengthened

2308261 google is very committed to giving russian users advertisers and partners the best possible service and experience
2308262 this agreement will result in better search results and more relevant advertising for our russian users and publishers
2308263 the malicious code not only negates the effectiveness of vistas address space layout randomization and data execution prevention technologies but specifically abuses their behavior to ensure an attack gets through
2308264 strictly speaking the number of pages out there is infinite for example web calendars may have a
2308265 we dont index every one of those trillion pages many of them are similar to each other or represent auto generated content similar to the calendar example that isnt very useful to searchers
2308266 google downloads the web continuously collecting updated page information and re processing the entire web link graph several times per day this graph of one trillion urls is similar to a map made up of one trillion intersections so multiple times every day we do the computational equivalent of fully exploring every intersection of every road in the united states except itd be a map about 50 000 times as big as the u s with 50 000 times as many roads and intersections
2308267 adobe flash previously called shockwave flash and macromedia flash is a set of multimedia technologies developed and distributed by adobe systems and earlier by macromedia
2308268 we ve heard requests for deep linking linking to specific content inside file not just for flash results but also for other large documents and presentations in the case of flash the ability to deep link will require additional functionality in flash with which we integrate
2308269 you can create multiple html files that provide different variables to the swf and start your application at the correct subsection by creating multiple entry points you can get the benefits of a site that is indexed as a suite of pages but still only need to manage one copy of your application
2308270 at this time content loaded dynamically from resource files is not indexed we ve noted this feature request from several webmasters look for this in a near future update
2308271 googlebot does not execute some types of javascript so if your web page loads a flash file via javascript google may not be aware of that flash file in which case it will not be indexed
2308272 we currently do not attach content from external resources that are loaded by your flash files if your flash file loads an html file an xml file another swf file etc google will separately index that resource but it will not yet be considered to be part of the content in your flash file
2308273 while we are able to index flash in almost all of the languages found on the web currently there are difficulties with flash content written in bidirectional languages until this is fixed we will be unable to index hebrew language or arabic language content from flash files
2308274 you know just as well as i do how impressionable my child is and so you also know
2308275 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2308276 no you cannot do it the old way you need find a better way
2308277 anyway what if there was enough oil in anwr to allow the u s to drive its economy with the stuff for the next 1000 years what incentive would there be to develop alternative fuels then
2308278 has anyone else noticed that most of the comments posted here against offshore drilling contain well thought out arguments while most against just resort to insults
2308279 the doe says that offshore drilling will have almost no impact
2308280 and i assume you dont advocate nationalizing the oil companies so you must be referring to something else
2308281 its not like you can put the earth in a test tube and perform an experiment on it
2308282 offshore drilling would increase domestic production of crude oil by only about 1 percent
2308283 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal
2308284 this russian chick started the joint over ten years ago
2308285 as alt weeklies are moving towards the web what do job descriptions for editorial side web editors look like web editor being different from it guy or webmaster programmer but an actual editorial role
2308286 it came about as a suggestion from uss new hampshire commissioning committee vice chairman doug bates
2308287 i thought it was a fun idea to have a beer produced in honor of the event
2308288 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew
2308289 and i guess they had a great time doing it
2308290 we get a lot of requests from private people to do special beers and we say no to virtually all of them
2308291 but we thought this one had a lot of merit and it was worth pursuing
2308292 a lot of people eat meat and i eat what i kill
2308293 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2308294 i just want people to know nothing is going to happen right away
2308295 at the optimum things wont be ready until september 2011
2308296 this preliminary schedule was developed just working around a june 2009 referendum date that you informed me of
2308297 i would propose that this is a lengthy schedule and some of the individual line items may possibly be reduced in time frame or accelerated
2308298 its not to early to ask people who want to get involved to contact us
2308299 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market our leading position in supporting the market and providing liquidity is clear and now we are the first firm to give all clients private corporate and institutional the opportunity to be made whole

2308301 shes probably one of the most determined people ive ever met
2308302 i certainly wouldnt have been able to walk 14 years without his help
2308303 he is definitely the best orthopaedic doctor hes so current in his field
2308304 the biggest thing is he totally understands the athletes mind he worked with me as if i was already an olympian
2308305 its fun working with high level athletes it gives you a tremendous about of gratitude
2308306 i felt like i couldve gone faster but not knowing the course is tough but it all went well
2308307 i ran the race last year and it was 90 degrees so it was nice to come back and run in this weather
2308308 i like the course and its nice going downhill that last half mile of it
2308309 i hadnt run a 5k since last cross country season so its been a while
2308310 cory was running with me and he was telling me what was going on
2308311 i like the whole atmosphere around this race there are people at every corner cheering you on and there is a big barbecue after you cant beat it
2308312 training is going well but its just not time for racing yet
2308313 even though my season didnt go so well i still ran well at the beginning of the year now im just looking forward to the upcoming season
2308314 timmy welch will start game one brad monroe will start game two timmys as good a pitcher as ive seen
2308315 our goal every year is to win a state tournament
2308316 we do have a number of college players on our team and it seems to be a different guy for us every night its been happening that way all year
2308317 well go down there and hope to squeak out a win on thursday
2308318 anything we get at this point is really a bonus
2308319 but the shipyard is about so much more than facilities
2308320 impacts men women and children across the entire nation its time for a change
2308321 this administration has tried to undermine the rights of labor unions in order to save a few pennies
2308322 the power to order google at amp t and yahoo to forward to the government all e mails phone calls and text messages where one party to the conversation is thought to be overseas
2308323 people who are willing to give up their freedoms for security deserve neither of them
2308324 as part of a campaign to illustrate the potential environmental and financial impacts of climate change
2308325 from a pr standpoint the virtual concert idea was an unprecedented triumph can you remember another time when an otherwise routine concert announcement made the news pages of the all the main uk dailies
2308326 it was the much vaunted community feel of second life whereby an event is marked more by its fostering of a kind of virtual being together than by the actual quality of what is currently on offer that was in many respects the main victor on the night
2308327 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
2308328 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth it was unnecessary were a small knit group the fact that this was a brand new policy and we werent as aware of it as we should have been they should have had a rules meeting to make us more aware
2308329 we all went around the table a couple of times and said what we thought it ended with us not agreeing with it
2308330 all i was thinking about was that one stroke penalty and it could affect the outcome of the tournament that putt seemed to turn my focus a little bit
2308331 sometimes when you get down in golf its very difficult to rebound
2308332 and megan on the other hand while i was losing my focus she was gaining more focus
2308333 i wish wed been able to play 54 holes its kind of a bummer
2308334 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2308335 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2308336 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2308337 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2308338 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2308339 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2308340 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2308341 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2308342 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2308343 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
2308344 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2308345 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2308346 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2308347 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2308348 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2308349 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2308350 i hope i can play at the level that ive always played at
2308351 theres no guarantees there have never been any guarantees for me its football and anything can happen
2308352 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer
2308353 im not a traitor never will be its business its the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give i hope the jets fans see the same thing
2308354 i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy but i know how tough the city can be and i know how great it can be
2308355 it can be as good as you want to make it
2308356 i have some essential content duplicated across my websites will i be penalized for this
2308357 i have a number of websites used to market xyz travel the main site features all products and a number of specialist boutique websites feature duplicates of these products is this an acceptable practice or am i being penalized by google how can this be overcome
2308358 i accept that creative write ups can be rewritten if essential but fact is fact what can i do about factual data i e room numbers types facilities amenities address rates name etc
2308359 microsofts success is based on two products and only two products windows and office microsoft is obsessed with the idea that google will undermine one or both of those monopolies through google apps this is all steve ballmer thinks about and is what made him so eager to spend 40 billion for yahoo but what if the real threat isnt google at all but apple
2308360 given the code apple already has for its iwork applications how much more effort would it take to webify those apps too not much id say a year from now i guarantee you that mobileme will offer a complete suite of web based office applications
2308361 recently we improved our algorithms to process new information faster and the result is quite tangible you should now see fresher suggestions for queries on current topics of interest
2308362 because information on the web is constantly changing we think this improvement will help you find relevant information faster to give this a test drive try searching for iphone you should see related queries around the brand new 3g iphone announced earlier this week
2308363 first it does not signal that yahoo plans to exit paid search quite the contrary through the financial benefits of better monetizing our search traffic we ll be investing in search services and ad platforms including panama
2308364 get your content out to your audience wherever they are

2308368 they want to turn grantville and allied gardens into a high density population center thats why we have such a broad coalition behind us
2308369 in the end theres no free market transaction with that threat we oppose that
2308370 but since we are made whole in what we will lose under the redevelopment project we saw no reason not to settle
2308371 if the public is demanding change and demanding results what we need is the will to get it done
2308372 i would need to take a case by case basis
2308373 if you want the status quo vote for jeb bradley if youre looking for change vote for me
2308374 im not into trading favors i never have and never will

2308380 in this day and age loyalties are lacking in sport and often money talks too loudly
2308381 i think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed in sport and the ioc should have ensured this didnt happen
2308382 its the olympics and it doesnt matter what time they ask us to swim
2308383 it might affect the times because its the morning and nobodys used to swimming then but everyones on the same playing field and truth is nobody remembers times anyway
2308384 its the olympics and all that matters is who wins the medals
2308385 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shouldve told him im a f ckin rock star today is gonna be the day that im gone throw it back to you im living life like a rocker im like pimp c partner coming down in mercedes peelin off on the poppers world wide show im coming down in the chopper hundred and eighty thou screamin hov with the roc up ask yeezy i got girls on shoulders showing me they chee cheez girls in the front row twirling they hair they wanna sample hov like a girl premier got ladies in the mosh pit dancing off beat but they know the words to my shit

2308407 we dont know what additional charges there are if any until we get the autopsy
2308408 to have a homicide charge you have to have intent even as low as negligent
2308409 it could still be ruled medically a homicide to charge a homicide you also have to say hes being charged with an intent he did it purposefully to cause the death the cause by the medical examiner is important
2308410 all too often innocent law abiding people suffer tragic consequences and the loss of loved ones due to this careless disregard for human life

2308457 im sorry to disappoint you i am not going to overturn divorce court decisions thats why we have courts and thats why people go to court and get a divorce if i as president of the united states said this decision has to be overturned without the proper appeals process then i would be disturbing our entire system of government but for me to stand here before all these people and say that im going declare divorces invalid because someone feels that they werent treated fairly in court we are getting into a uh uh tar baby of enormous proportions

2308483 and others if you have problems with the facts represented here please send your letter to the two grandsons of gandhi arun gandhi and rahul gandhi dr singh
2308484 friends have been urging me to write to you for the sake of humanity but i have resisted their request because of the feeling that any letter from me would be an impertinence
2308485 something tells me that i must not calculate and that i must make my appeal for whatever it may be worth
2308486 anyway i anticipate your forgiveness if i have erred in writing to you i remain your sincere friend sd m mk gandhi
2308487 it is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to the savage state must you pay that price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war not without considerable success
2308488 in other words gandhi was a nave fool who tried in vain to sell his non violence as a panacea to the fuhrer
2308489 to which gandhi refers the topic of heated diplomatic exchanges and indeed the professed casus belli of the impending german invasion of poland was the rights of the german minority in poland along with the issue of the
2308490 in a brief statement of what exactly he stood for
2308491 contrasts with the manner in which he addressed the british courts in south africa out of which he was thrown out
2308492 we have no doubt about your bravery or devotion to your fatherland nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your opponents
2308493 but your own writings and pronouncements and those of your friends and admirers leave no room for doubt that many of your acts are monstrous and unbecoming of human dignity especially in the estimation of men like me who believe in human friendliness such are your humiliation of czechoslovakia the rape of poland and the swallowing of denmark i am aware that your view of life regards such spoliations as virtuous acts but we have been taught from childhood to regard them as acts degrading humanity
2308494 but ours is a unique position we resist british imperialism no less than nazism
2308495 if there is a difference it is in degree one fifth of the human race has been brought under the british heel by means that will not bear scrutiny
2308496 our resistance to it does not mean harm to the british people we seek to convert them not to defeat them on the battle field
2308497 the rulers may have our land and bodies but not our souls
2308498 we know what the british heel means for us and the non european races of the world but we would never wish to end the british rule with german aid

2308502 in south africa was to promote racial segregation by refusing to share a post office door with the black natives
2308503 a general belief seems to prevail in the colony that the indians are little better if at all than the savages or natives of africa even the children are taught to believe in that manner with the result that the indian is being dragged down to the position of a raw kaffir
2308504 one can understand the necessity for registration of kaffirs local native of south africa who will not work
2308505 why of all places in johannesburg the indian location should be chosen for dumping down all the kaffirs of the town passes my comprehension the town council must withdraw the kaffirs local native of south africa from the location
2308506 kaffirs are as a rule uncivilized the convicts even more so they are troublesome very dirty and live almost like animals

2308540 this is not just an anecdotal problem it is confirmed by the county councils own statistics
2308541 we spend roughly 1 million a year it has been going down over the past few years in 2005 6 it was 1 2 million and last year it was 0 9 million
2308542 that said we are going to be putting more money into footways and lesser level roads in the next financial year
2308543 our footways and our unclassified roads are not so good we are going to be concentrating on those its difficult to put a number on the backlog of footways there are a lot of them we know we have a reasonable amount of work to do

2308561 put the currently planned field testing at several sporting and entertainment venues into appropriate context
2308562 regardless of how these tests validate certain technical parameters of spectrum sensing those venues would be fully protected anyway under

2308564 identified the tv stations in the area and ranked available channels based on environment it was very reliable
2308565 not perfect but it reflected issues the fcc had found in the lab if the fcc decides to use and include sensing in devices that eventually go to market at least it gives them a good feel for what they can do to develop certification tests
2308566 we remain confident that the technical concepts behind spectrum sensing ultimately are sound so that fcc certified white spaces devices can operate safely and efficiently using this particular protection capability

2308594 young people are not going to see a lame interpretation of the novels theyre going to see a very energised event part of me thought this should be a bit like going to see a robbie williams concert so there are lot of songs and dancing in it
2308595 i wanted to keep the integrity of the source material because the stories stand up on their own theyre self contained and genuinely funny in the book henry has the ability to transform himself he can be a tyrannosaurus rex if he wants and characters appear at will so there will be nothing literal on stage what i didnt want to do was put henry in a room

2308606 this is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states
2308607 what we learned is that among adults with active epilepsy more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy and thats really unacceptable
2308608 its not possible to get state of the art care
2308609 there are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder
2308610 in my own personal practice id say that i can manage at least half if not more of the patients that have seizure disorder
2308611 theres only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist
2308612 if you cant afford to buy it which is what i run into with a lot of the seizure medicine it doesnt really matter
2308613 many people with epilepsy do lead normal productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder

2308618 y l os dio vida a vosotros cuando estabais muertos en vuestros delitos y pecados en los cuales anduvisteis en otro tiempo siguiendo la corriente de este mundo conforme al pr ncipe de la potestad del aire el esp ritu que ahora opera en los hijos de desobediencia entre los cuales tambi n todos nosotros vivimos en otro tiempo en los deseos de nuestra carne haciendo la voluntad de la carne y de los pensamientos y ramos por naturaleza hijos de ira lo mismo que los dem s
2308619 mudar el et ope su piel y el leopardo sus manchas as tambi n podr is vosotros hacer bien estando habituados a hacer mal
2308620 recibiendo el galard n de su injusticia ya que tienen por delicia el gozar de deleites cada d a estos son inmundicias y manchas quienes aun mientras comen con vosotros se recrean en sus errores tienen los ojos llenos de adulterio no se sacian de pecar seducen a las almas inconstantes tienen el coraz n habituado a la codicia y son hijos de maldici n pero les ha acontecido lo del verdadero proverbio el perro vuelve a su v mito y la puerca lavada a revolcarse en el cieno
2308621 porque el ocuparse de la carne es muerte pero el ocuparse del esp ritu es vida y paz por cuanto los designios de la carne son enemistad contra dios porque no se sujetan a la ley de dios ni tampoco pueden y los que viven seg n la carne no pueden agradar a dios
2308622 jehov mir desde los cielos sobre los hijos de los hombres para ver si hab a alg n entendido que buscara a dios todos se desviaron a una se han corrompido no hay quien haga lo bueno no hay ni siquiera uno
2308623 no hay quien entienda no hay quien busque a dios
2308624 respondi jes s y le dijo de cierto de cierto te digo que el que no naciere de nuevo no puede ver comprender percibir el reino de dios
2308625 pero el hombre natural no percibe las cosas que son del esp ritu de dios porque para l son locura y no las puede entender porque se han de discernir espiritualmente
2308626 pero si nuestro evangelio est a n encubierto entre los que se pierden est encubierto en los cuales el dios de este siglo ceg el entendimiento de los incr dulos para que no les resplandezca la luz del evangelio de la gloria de cristo el cual es la imagen de dios
2308627 libr ndote de tu pueblo y de los gentiles a quienes ahora te env o para que abras sus ojos para que se conviertan de las tinieblas a la luz y de la potestad de satan s a dios para que reciban por la fe que es en m perd n de pecados y herencia entre los santificados
2308628 en l estaba la vida y la vida era la luz de los hombres la luz en las tinieblas resplandece y las tinieblas no prevalecieron contra ella
2308629 y esta es la condenaci n que la luz vino al mundo y los hombres amaron m s las tinieblas que la luz porque sus obras eran malas porque todo aquel que hace lo malo aborrece la luz y no viene a la luz para que sus obras no sean reprendidas
2308630 y dijo anda y di a este pueblo o d bien y no entend is ved por cierto mas no comprend is engruesa el coraz n de este pueblo y agrava sus o dos y ciega sus ojos para que no vea con sus ojos ni oiga con sus o dos ni su coraz n entienda ni se convierta y haya para l sanidad
2308631 por qu no entend is mi lenguaje porque no pod is escuchar mi palabra vosotros sois de vuestro padre el diablo y los deseos de vuestro padre quer is hacer el ha sido homicida desde el principio y no ha permanecido en la verdad porque no hay verdad en l cuando habla mentira de suyo habla porque es mentiroso y padre de mentira el que es de dios las palabras de dios oye por esto no las o s vosotros porque no sois de dios
2308632 pero dec a que lo que del hombre sale eso contamina al hombre porque de dentro del coraz n de los hombres salen los malos pensamientos los adulterios las fornicaciones los homicidios los hurtos las avaricias las maldades el enga o la lascivia la envidia la maledicencia la soberbia la insensatez todas estas maldades de dentro salen y contaminan al hombre
2308633 qui n podr decir yo he limpiado mi coraz n limpio estoy de mi pecado
2308634 enga oso es el coraz n m s que todas las cosas y perverso qui n lo conocer
2308635 y les dar un coraz n y un esp ritu nuevo pondr dentro de ellos y quitar el coraz n de piedra de en medio de su carne y les dar un coraz n de carne
2308636 os dar coraz n nuevo y pondr esp ritu nuevo dentro de vosotros y quitar de vuestra carne el coraz n de piedra y os dar un coraz n de carne

2308656 the door flew open i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2308657 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2308658 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives

2308678 i thought someone will make a film of this but i didnt think it would be me the more you admire a writer the more difficult it is to adapt his work but when i read this script by nicholas meyer who also wrote the screenplay for the film of roths the human stain i thought well this is a really smart adaptation this is really roth and so i said yes
2308679 i think hes never apologetic about being a male and thats one of the things that really attracts me to his writing
2308680 he read me his book page by page and he talked about every single detail
2308681 i know that for him this is a very very personal story but i told him this is a film and a film has its own laws my job is to take the things that are relevant for the journey the characters are taking us on and to leave behind the things that arent
2308682 he said that we have to have in the movie and i said no over my dead body but why he asked this is a very powerful scene
2308683 so i said philip you know what im from barcelona im not american i dont have any problem doing whatevers right for the film but people dont want to hear the sound of those teeth if i show that at the beginning of the film i think it will make it hard for the audience to sympathise with these characters im not saying you have to like them but you have to care
2308684 i think the novel has a beautiful ending because it leaves us not knowing whats going to happen
2308685 but i felt the characters in my film needed some kind of redemption some kind of hope but this is not wow he discovers he loves her everything is fine no i hate that lifes not going to be the same for them that has to be clear

2308707 they would have got me again had it not been for her and i will be forever grateful
2308708 i received lots of backing from witness support who were with me every step of the way they eliminated a lot of the stress for me and i was very well looked after i was able to give my evidence by video link which made me feel more confident about speaking out
2308709 i know everybody else could still see me but i only had to look at the people i was talking to
2308710 the local community have also been very supportive too and i would like to thank them for that
2308711 it was an honour to be asked to meet the jury after the delivery of the verdict
2308712 this is not something i have encountered before and to be thanked personally by the jury really meant a lot
2308713 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001
2308714 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2308715 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc

2308726 i have read that if a child comes to christ 12 percent of the time the whole family will follow if the mom comes theres a 15 percent chance the family will but if the man comes to church 90 percent of the time the family will come behind thats the reality and thats why we do this
2308727 roadside advertising causes a distraction to drivers and could result in accidents
2308728 when people stop commonsense happening people like us who are trying to survive in business will do all sorts of other things
2308729 surely its more distracting for people who cant find me and go up and down the a35 the a354 which is an absolute nightmare
2308730 some people have been an hour on the a354 and they dont need to go there
2308731 things need to be signposted how is everybody going to find them

2308744 i tried to get out of the front windows but they have child safety catches on so in the end i threw the mattress out of the back window
2308745 my partner passed the kids down to me after all three came down she came out herself
2308746 its ten years worth of stuff but we are all safe we have to start again
2308747 it was either a fag butt which hadnt gone out properly or a lamp because there was a lot of electricals quite close to the sofa

2308749 they were in total shock i didnt know how to put it i just put it as matter of factly as possible
2308750 i said im really sorry your house has burnt down it is unsalvageable
2308751 we are trying to convince them to take the cruise back theres nothing they can do here they have a five day cruise coming back
2308752 they think it started off as an electrical problem in the downstairs office
2308753 we dont know if that means a computer was on or if some wiring went wrong it doesnt look like arson
2308754 the house is completely gutted and mark is completely gutted it is going to have to be rebuilt completely
2308755 son para m bellas experiencias experiencias nuevas estar aqu junto con tantos campeones es algo muy bello agradezco a todos por las declaraciones y la estima que me han demostrado durante este tiempo he recibido el apoyo de importantes personalidades del club y eso me da mucha satisfacci n he llegado desde peque o a esta sociedad y estoy ahora mismo con el primer equipo de forma inesperada era mi sue o de ni o y esto es muy bello
2308756 ha sido una gran vitrina nuestro objetivo era clasificarnos a la fase intermedia en donde pudimos eliminar a francia que era la favorita el objetivo era lograr el pase para el mundial y paso a paso hemos ido superando etapas hasta llegar a la final contra alemania hemos estado mal ese d a pero alemania demostr ser un equipo ptimo el mejor partido fue conra la rep blica checa era decisivo para pasar de turno y todo el equipo lo ha hecho estupendamente
2308757 han sido partidos bell simos de poder disputar en cuanto el milan me ha llamado he dicho r pidamente que s renunciando a las vacaciones

2308760 estamos trabajando bien tratando de eliminar las lagunas que tuvimos en mosc y esperamos que el test de ma ana contra el manchester city pueda ser un encuentro positivo en la porter a jugar dida tras un largo periodo de inactividad est trabajando bien en los entrenamientos y espero que el partido de ma ana pueda ser unja confirmaci n de lo que est haciendo en ataque jugar paloschi y posiblemente debutar viudez la derrota en mosc debe ser un est mulo para evitar que vuelva a ocurrir algo as hay que jugar bien especialmente en la fase defensiva
2308761 hay m s preocupaci n por nesta la condici n de nesta que por la de kak puesto que su problema es m s complicado alessandro es baja desde hace tiempo ambos no est n disponibles y est n trabajando para recuperarse kak padece una inflamaci n en la rodilla mientras que nesta tiene un problema en la espalda que es algo m s serio y que estamos tratando de resolver en cuanto a los plazos de recuperaci n no soy m dico pero hasta hoy no hemos hablado de una posible operaci n kaladze sufre una molestia en la rodilla debido a la fatiga por los entrenamientos inzaghi en tanto estar contra la juventus
2308762 son dos chavales j venes cardaccio tiene m s experiencia es un centrocampista cl sico y puede jugar en todos los roles viudez tiene m s talento es muy r pido es un segundo punta muy veloz a nivel t cnico son dos jugadores diversos puesto que uno es centrocampista y el otro delantero creo que con el tiempo lo har n muy bien en el milan
2308763 en el partido de ayer con brasil ante b lgica no he visto un ritmo elevado pato contro il belgio non ho visto ritmi elevati pato se ha movido m s que dinho pero ronaldinho viene de un periodo de inactividad m s largo y creo que ellos junto con diego forman un sistema id neo
2308764 si vemos los nombres de los jugadores que han llegado al milan veremos que son importantes jugadores ya consolidados el grupo hoy incluyendo a los reci n llegados es un buen grupo aunque hay varios jugadores nuevos que tienen que aprender y crecer ser un a o importante en el que trataremos de ganar la liga y la copa uefa estos nuevos fichajes han aportado mucho entusiasmo y eso lo percibimos todos
2308765 generalmente en mi carrera tambi n en las temporadas pasadas siempre he podido coger r pido la mejor forma siempre estoy motivado al comienzo de la campa a porque siempre hay cosas importantes para ganar y nunca debes perder la motivaci n es cricual mantenerla siempre a niveles altos
2308766 no he seguido realmente la ola de cr ticas tras el partido ante el chelsea he disfrutado mis d as de descanso pero igualmente creo que las cr ticas son buenas es bueno para un equipo que quiere ganar la liga y se dominante en europa sabemos que tras una derrota como sa siempre habr cr ticas pero es mejor que llegue eso ahora que quedan tres semanas para el comienzo de la campa a ya no hay m s amistosos sencillos son todos partidos de verdad y cada vez que saltas al campo tienes que dar el m ximo puedes perder pero para nosotros ha sido un momento que nos dar la oportunidad de mejorar y aumentar nuestra motivaci n
2308767 siempre he dicho que ronaldinho es uno de los jugadores con los que me gustar a jugar por mucho tiempo cuando nos enfrentamos con el barcelona hemos intercambiado las camisetas y le he dicho que esperaba que llegase pronto estoy contento de que finalmente haya llegado
2308768 todos quieren a ronaldinho y aparte de l han llegado otros como borriello flamini y zambrotta
2308769 no creo que sea una dificultad que jugadores como seedorf ronaldinho and kaka jueguen juntos durante estos d as se han tomado muchas decisiones pero creo que en la campa a 2002 03 jugadores como rivaldo rui costa inzaghi sheva y pirlo han jugado juntos no veo por qu deber a haber problemas ahora si no recuerdo mal en aquellos a os ganamos algunas cosas
2308770 nesta volver pronto pero aparte de l el milan tiene a jugadores como simic y bonera que son internacionales por su pa ses luego est n maldini kaladze digao ydarmian que ha regresado y creo que es un gran proyecto
2308771 en cuanto a kak hay algo de preocupaci n porque si durante la preparaci n alguien no tiene la tranquilidad adecuada creo que hay que darle el suficiente tiempo para que regrese al ciento por ciento y est disponible para el equipo
2308772 los errores que fueron remarcados por el t cnico en la defensa tras el partido ante el chelsea han sido analizados
2308773 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2308774 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2308775 but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2308776 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2308779 in most economies smaller enterprises are much greater in number than large firms and these small fish are also responsible for driving innovation and competition
2308780 it takes a minute because i really have to think about it and get my head out of the tyranny of operational urgencies and into the strategic space i so rarely inhabit eventually your cell phone beeps with my response
2308781 according to the a list strategy gurus such as harvards michael porter my biggest challenge is gaining access to major enterprise customers who will stretch and improve me and my product or service and you know what porter is absolutely right
2308782 thats easy its keeping my products and services ahead of the competition and avoiding the
2308783 to move away from the micro to the macro what do you see you meet me an economic development director in a major regional economy
2308784 this time you have to use email as thats the currency of the organization i work for
2308785 the biggest challenge for us is developing our regional economy by joining the dots between the small indigenous local companies and global enterprises

2308805 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2308806 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
2308807 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
2308808 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2308809 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts
2308810 ive heard people speak of it as a level of humility about understanding different cultures thats quite appropriate

2308829 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role

2308840 a soldier man or woman could get drunk in bangkok wake up in the morning and be married as will happen sometimes in places like las vegas or bangkok be killed the next day and the spouse who was a product of the evenings celebration would have then a right to claim access to come to the united states on a green card

2308847 further evidence of the systematic jewish use of christian eschatological imagery
2308848 ms 666 so far i havent seen a convincing mccainiac version though ann coulter w ould qualify if she joined his campaign finally carpathias career progression is a much better match to obamas than to mccains
2308849 in the case of mccain we know exactly where his policy is
2308850 i know personally mccain for 20 years he is a person of principle and he is also a person who has absolutely a great record of supporting israel getting to obama there is no record nobody can know for sure what will be it can happen to be good it can happen to be very bad its a risk
2308851 the issue that has done the most to convince many israelis that sharanskys commitment to democratic procedures is selective was his recent behavior as minister for jerusalem
2308852 their ultimate goal is to have a muslim theocracy imposed all over the world how do we know because they tell us so

2308855 we are aware that a half maybe even more than a half of serbia does not approve of this but we believe that citizens will in three or four years realise that this was the best solution
2308856 some 27 000 serbs in bosnia hercegovina were not killed by humanitarians but by a certain policy for which someone must be held responsible

2308859 one of the most wanted fugitives in the world lived among us he was not hiding he was just hiding his identity

2308862 he wanted to be tried by our court he trusts our courts
2308863 which serb has proved his innocence before the hague tribunal
2308864 what can we expect from the eu after radovan karadzics arrest serbia will get the membership by 2014
2308865 an indication of the exhilaration over karadzics surprising arrest is perhaps the fact that belgrade for the first time was not rapped on the knuckles from either washington the hague or brussels
2308866 freely moved not only all over serbia but across the region and even russia
2308867 id like to know which state should support karadzic he is not a citizen of serbia therefore serbia has no obligations towards him
2308868 radovan should get all the possible help from all serb lands and communities
2308869 regarding radovans arrest i as a serb from the serb republic can say freely it was high time
2308870 a question did the former premier know where the most wanted man in the world was hiding will he like any other citizen of serbia be held accountable before the law for aiding and abetting the indictee

2308885 your reality is your reality your perception is your perception whatever your truth is it is trying to understand the difference between your truth and the truth of others embedded in your consciousness and being is a great challenge
2308886 what are you what is your beauty what is your ugliness what is fat what is happy what is perfect what is love what is art what is
2308887 your perception of your truth is what is at this moment in this time and most likely ever changing everyone being wired and divinely programmed differently has their own truth every truth is valid and perhaps its the complete opposite of others
2308888 creating reality and beauty onstage or on the screen is my truth at this time
2308889 i want to devour the true reality of my life i no longer want to be numb to my journey anymore it seems that all ive concentrated on is what i havent achieved yet in my life or what ive not become as a woman or artist
2308890 his siblings and others of his community fly at him peck at him torment him they mean to chase him away and the ugly duckling is heartbroken to be rejected by his own it is a terrible thing especially since he did nothing to warrant it other than look different and act different while exile is not a thing to desire for the fun of it there is an unexpected gain from it the gifts of exile are many it takes out weakness by the pounding it removes whininess enables acute insight heightens intuition and grants the power of keen observation and perspective that the insider can never achieve
2308891 an optimist is a person who sees only the lights in the picture whereas a pessimist sees only the shadows an idealist however is one who sees the light and the shadows but in addition sees something else the possibility of changing the picture of making the lights prevail over the shadows
2308892 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the trouble makers the round heads in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
2308893 the people who pay for health care might want to start asking about these ideas
2308894 no thank you i would not like a mail order bride

2308896 there will be no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form
2308897 him and jim paterson at the start of last season were our two best players so i need the same start from him in this campaign
2308898 i think they have improved i would put that down to them their hard work their preparation the way they have looked after themselves this summer their attitude towards this season
2308899 they want to do well and are looking forward to europe they finished third and want to maintain themselves as a top six team
2308900 there are issues regarding work permits and things that we have to clarify before we know what we can do with him
2308901 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy which would be a corrective action for the lack of good choices that often led to their irresponsibility

2308907 dealing with the states fiscal crisis is an urgent priority there is absolutely no reason to delay discussion here we are on day 39 without a budget and no meetings are scheduled yet again to work on the budget negotiating a complicated budget such as this will take time and leadership i can only conclude that the lack of negotiations stem from the democrats unwillingness to talk about any solutions that do not include a tax increase we can balance this budget without tax increases and it is imperative that we do so now
2308908 we need to get our priorities straight and demand greater accountability for how our tax dollars are spent in sacramento

2308942 it felt great its been sort of depressing on that sideline watching everybody but now that im able to get back involved its just a great feeling
2308943 hopefully tomorrow it wont be as sore and ill be able to do the same thing
2308944 we worked him in slowly the last couple of practices so he went through individual and then today we just kind of let him go
2308945 i would venture to guess its going to be a little bit sore but well see how he tolerated this practice it was really good to get him back
2308946 i cant come in and just do every route and do every play they told me to be smart about it i know my body and just tell them when i feel something i made it through most of the practice
2308947 in 1967 i was on duty as a missile launch officer first i get one call saying that theyre seeing strange lights flying in the sky about five minutes later the main security guard the flight security controller calls down and says hes looking at a glowing red object very large hovering over the front gate
2308948 and as i watched the warhead the dummy warhead that was put out in front of it as the decoy to deflect the russian radar everything was flying along and suddenly at about 8 000 miles an hour an object came into the frame shot a beam of light at the warhead flew up to the top shot another beam of light at the warhead flew around the direction it was flying shot another beam of light at the warhead flew down to shoot another beam of light at the warhead and then flew out the same way it came in
2308949 i was called in they have a map of the whole complex the green lights where the missiles are good but theres one small area with 10 red lights it means those missiles were out a missile had gone down my job as a target officer was to bring them back up very rarely does a missile malfunction and i dont think any much more rare would be two at the same time but never 10
2308950 we have stack s of reports of flying saucers we take them seriously when you consider we have lost many men and planes trying to intercept them
2308951 the object was traveling at 2 000 miles per hour and he saw it make a sudden 90 degree turn without slowing down
2308952 ahmed musa a young boy was killed by a bullet of the occupying forces in nilin

2308954 my greatest fear is the loss of humanity among israeli troops because of the ongoing warfare
2308955 oh how we tried to resolve this issue through diplomacy
2308956 iran is without a doubt a backward nation that is belligerent and hostile nuclear weapons in the hands of such a nation would be a disaster

2308978 i would rather fall in love with a stripper than a rookie because they will break your heart
2308979 it aint the best there were some missed tackles there were some third down conversions there was some rushing yardage there was getting pushed around there were some snaps where we had people dogtrotting we did some things we werent very proud of we were glad to win the ballgame but by no stretch of the imagination was that a work of art their backups just played a little bit worse than our backups
2308980 we will get to see guys under the big lights
2308981 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation

2308985 i just know what our guys can and cant do and weve got guys that can make plays after the catch
2308986 so you dont always have to throw it down the field all the time get it in their hands quick and now the onus is on the defense to make tackles on guys that can make people miss
2308987 i think hes getting guys the ball in different positions in different areas of the field to give guys a chance to run after the catch
2308988 ultimately thats what youre going to need to make big plays youre not always going to get long bombs so youll have to get yards running after the catch moving and spreading guys around certainly helps
2308989 we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2308990 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2308991 im not pushing you away and im not telling you to come down here you should do what you want to do i love to operate so ill be happy to do it you just let me know either way

2309006 new research shows that just thinking about these foods can have a significant effect
2309007 imagery tactics are the most potent cognitive behavior interventions for pain
2309008 we found that food fantasies such as imagining eating your favorite ice cream chocolate cake or meal had a strong pain attenuating effect it enhanced mood reduced anxiety and helped coping with ice water pain
2309009 pleasurable response derived from excitement may facilitate the involvement of internal opioid mechanisms to counteract pain
2309010 excitement absorbs attention and pleasant imagery can induce hypnotic like states that detracts from pain improves positive mood and reinforces personal belief in the manageability of pain
2309011 when cravers viewed pictures of chocolate this activated regions of the brain known to be involved in habit forming behaviours and drug addiction
2309012 combining the sight and taste of chocolate produced a stronger reaction in both cravers and non cravers than either separately

2309020 i think they saw the handwriting on the wall and gave up
2309021 i believe its just catering to ignorance to tell people its bst free and its better for you
2309022 im not surprised to find they want to step back from it its gotten a bad rap for so long
2309023 is a nice quick dramatic indication of what the possibilities are
2309024 this is really just an offshoot of a project that is really aimed at trying to develop a methodology ultimately to be used in surgery
2309025 i am a writer and i have been accused of merely writing autobiography in my stories as if that were somehow easier to do than making everything up before i went to meet lawrence agitated as i was it crossed my mind that i would find some way of writing about seeing him after so many years the things we say to each other what has become of us some peripheral telling of lies maybe or an extension of the fact that will take the encounter from the banal to the cosmic that will find a universal chord because that is what good writers do the ones who know there is no difference among autobiography biography fiction or non fiction between stories and real life

2309032 there is an extremely high probability that an investor will own a high performing mutual fund that will go through at least one sustained period of poor performance not only relative to its benchmark but also relative to its peers
2309033 investors appear to be buying high funds coming off a strong period and selling low funds coming off a weak period

2309038 the nytimes recently did a story on obamas experience as a community organizer it described a problem with asbestos in a housing project in chicago obama attempted to organize residents of the housing project to confront the landlord but instead of successfully managing the issue general chaos broke out obama then left community organizing for harvard having been trained in community organizing i know the drill the training attempts to get one in touch with ones anger about injustices from the past and then take those feelings into the present such a model does not create community it engenders amp rekindles past resentments and victimhood and sources your actions from that the training does not attempt to make one see the injustice that just about all of us have experienced the training takes the past into the present and makes it ones future such a model is unsustainable obamas compassion for the poor is laudable but a political campaign based upon techniques of corrupt urban centers that the majority of americans have striven to either reform or escape from is a tenuous model from which one attempts to win the presidency of the usa
2309039 the current political advantage of the republican party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop signature ideas this strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations
2309040 a rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology
2309041 voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program
2309042 to attract a majority of votes parties cannot simply try to appear median quite the contrary
2309043 winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents
2309044 the intention is to provide consumers with that choice or information over time about one supermarket chain versus another against a basket of goods and well continue to refine this over time
2309045 any problems that may affect the access of people with a disability will be rectified as soon as possible
2309046 as most disabled people are on pensions and money is always an issue this website had the potential to be of great assistance to us if it had been designed correctly
2309047 it appears that the site was put together in a hurry with little thought of allowing disabled people access and most certainly was not tested by disabled people before it came online as any good website should be
2309048 ive had people already tell me that theyre not finding the grocerychoice website terribly useful

2309051 on saturday august 9th in pittsburgh single payer healthcare reform advocates will gather at a press conference at the david lawrence convention center where the dnc platform committee is completing its draft platform planks
2309052 our national healthcare not warfare campaign co chair donna smith will join with rep john conyers and other elected leaders to call for meaningful reform and amendments to the platform language
2309053 it was only two weeks ago that womencount launched our campaign to stop the silence on sexism
2309054 winning language in the platform draft is a huge accomplishment it is still only a first step
2309055 there are hurdles ahead now the language must be approved by the full platform committee this weekend in pittsburgh and then it will be subject to ratification in denver at the convention we will not rest until the official platform is printed
2309056 we think that in most respects the is undergoing a u s style housing correction
2309057 we think that this is likely to be followed up by years of much flatter growth than we have seen for the bulk of the preceding decade
2309058 the lack of mortgage funding increases the danger of an over correction in prices beyond what is required to bring buyer affordability in line
2309059 ya no estaremos m s en estos pasillos ya no tendremos la palabra amiga y el rega o oportuno de nuestros profesores comienza una nueva etapa para nosotros pero siempre volveremos aqu al liceo a nuestra casa
2309060 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2309061 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
2309062 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market
2309063 this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels
2309064 the halifax data provide yet more evidence of the major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions
2309065 holding the bank rate is better than raising rates but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs

2309067 its really special and a great honor to learn about the olympic movement understand what its all about and to represent your county by carrying the flag in is quite an honor
2309068 i was surprised because we have some great athletes on the team and it could have been anyone of us
2309069 the first few days are pretty sedate because people are trying to get adjusted to the time focusing on their event and everyone is pretty much serious
2309070 but a lot of times people are just catching up on old friends that they have competed against in the past so its like a reunion the world coming together for the olympics
2309071 we will be most grateful if we received this amount which would allow us to continue providing high quality civil legal assistance to low income elderly and other disadvantaged persons
2309072 but we would need a million dollars funding for us to give comparable wages to our attorney staff since the attorney staff of both the attorney generals office and public defenders office got raises
2309073 we have to turn people away because we do not have sufficient resources to serve all those who seek assistance
2309074 it would be an act of professional malpractice for us to accept clients when we do not have adequate resources to provide proper representation
2309075 i cant comment on where we are in terms of the investigation

2309084 i see the need for us to boost this some
2309085 this fiscal year so far we have spent close to 180 000 in the st thomas st john district for overtime for supervisors however the fire service was budgeted at 140 000
2309086 this would have taken care of the need to pay overtime for supervisors
2309087 the v i fire service is not equipped to fight shipboard fires or to do water rescues
2309088 do you feel handcuffed in terms of having the budget to the work you need to do
2309089 is on the table but there has been no takers
2309090 lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations

2309092 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain
2309093 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor they cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
2309094 honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
2309095 thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife nor his manservant or his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbours
2309096 democrats all over the country are energized in this historic political year
2309097 the development of a platform that truly reflects the ideals of the democratic electorate ideals that we all hope will guide a new democratic president and congress in 2009 is an important part of the process and i am honored to be an integral part of it

2309099 they hit a child and left him there to die
2309100 were doing everything we need to do and were tying up all the leads
2309101 it was the right thing to do going to korea for two weeks to train make all the adjustments to the time change the air and the heat
2309102 i think it worked well on our behalf we trained with the korean olympic team
2309103 when we came on the actual site it wasnt difficult for us yes its a little different as far as the heat and humidity
2309104 beijing is a little hotter and more humid than korea but its no problem at all and we are able to go with the flow im glad that we made the decision to come right next door two weeks before and get acclimated
2309105 i think if we came to beijing like many are doing now it would had definitely have an affect on us
2309106 weve come from a very high level and our strength and explosiveness is ready for warfare
2309107 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
2309108 the government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
2309109 sir i love that by the way could you place your items in the bin please
2309110 in order to continue our progress we must maintain a consistency in our funding level from our local government
2309111 tahesia will be the first competitor weve sent to the games that has made the a qualifying standard which is the most rigid of two
2309112 she won a 60 meters bronze medal at the iaaf world indoor championships this year and she has 40 meters more to run in beijing but we are hoping for a good performance when you get to the olympics or world championships you take it round by round from the prelims its to get to the quarters from the quarters to the semis and from the semis to the finals once you get to the final any number can play
2309113 everything has gone well since the athletes arrived on tuesday and i know that they have started their training
2309114 we have a wait of a few days to get ourselves settled and then i think well be perfect from there onwards
2309115 the rooms are pleasant and very roomy with air condition and the bathrooms are adequate
2309116 the bathrooms are large and comfortable and centrally located close to the bedrooms for both male and females
2309117 additionally we have more than adequate equipment more than we really need the volunteers even though most dont speak or understand english make a sincere effort to assist you
2309118 is not distributed evenly across the population but concentrated among the disadvantaged
2309119 shot past 15 percent in 1996 and crested at 20 3 percent in 2006 the most recent year for which numbers are available
2309120 the poor are more likely to develop such illnesses as diabetes hypertension heart disease cancer relative deprivation and its stress are involved
2309121 the current top marginal tax rate 35 percent is not the lowest its been there was no federal income tax until 1913 but it is far lower than the 91 percent tax levied on top earners from 1951 to 1963 meanwhile forces such as immigration and trade policy have put pressure on wages at the bottom
2309122 tax policies and employer pay practices affect income distribution directly
2309123 much more likely to agree that the poor could escape poverty if they worked hard enough conversely 54 percent of european respondents but only 30 percent of americans agreed that luck determines income
2309124 framers enshrined property rights as sacred and checked the governments ability to control the national economy
2309125 welfare states where left leaning groups have succeeded at writing in change
2309126 the vestiges of feudalism in european society make leftist arguments appealing there whereas american politicians rhetoric has emphasized individual agency since the time of george washington
2309127 the highest levels of inequality are found in the new world and not the old
2309128 societies with higher inequality also tend to have higher crime rates these are societies built on conquest many of them on slavery a lot of inequality may just be the legacy of those things
2309129 inequality may act on the human psyche to elicit hard work and high achievement but it also makes us more individualistic
2309130 social relationships trust reciprocity among friends and neighbors civic engagement
2309131 i care enough about the deceased to come here but not quite enough to change clothes
2309132 she said she hit the animal with a machete until the beast ran away
2309133 the government is clearly incapable of creating a criminal proof gold standard for identity
2309134 it is of deep concern the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
2309135 what is worse the same technology will underpin the governments identity card scheme which risks making us less safe
2309136 by putting your private information on a chip on a passport or id card designed to let it be skimmed off for official purposes the whole centralised approach to id makes it easier for your life to be perfectly stolen
2309137 the government cannot be trusted to look after your identity
2309138 they are a little bit aggressive if you bother them too much
2309139 menjadikan akaun anda dipenuhi dengan wang seperti tasik yang tak pernah kering airnya
2309140 we are sharing a floor with tennis stars andy and jamie murray but otherwise weve got the floor to ourselves
2309141 the food in the village is good the players are all in good spirits and olympic veterans are saying this olympic village is as good as any they have encountered
2309142 from our point of view the stadium is excellent a real state of the art venue
2309143 training went well in macau and we got out just before the typhoon struck now we are nicely settled in and waiting for the games to start
2309144 as usual we have a 36 hour rule that says anyone with a match early in the games wont take part in the opening ceremony so the doubles players will but tracey and andrew wont and they understand that
2309145 if tracey wins her opening match on saturday she faces another contest on sunday
2309146 the referee has just confirmed andrews change of start time today
2309147 floating lng is the most attractive in field option and darwin is the most commercially attractive onshore option for sunrise
2309148 maybe using lighter fluid wasnt such a good idea but it was an accident all the same and the wasps are gone
2309149 one of my men was killed on the spot when the taleban attacked us while four went missing the rest of us laid down our arms and were captured
2309150 they would see it as failure if they dont win gold theyre not going for silver and bronze
2309151 after the athens games the coxless four guys would have felt the mantle of being in such an iconic boat
2309152 but by now they have developed their own confidence and racing tactics
2309153 when steve redgrave retired after sydney i continued in the boat and we quickly moved on post redgrave it wasnt a burden hanging over us
2309154 and the boys currently in charge of the four will feel the same
2309155 they know past success will not win them races in the future they want to create their own history
2309156 they are deserved gold medal favourites in their own right nothing to do with what steve and i achieved in the same boat
2309157 they feel they should win gold because they were world champions in 2005 and 2006 anything other than victory would be a disaster for them
2309158 hes the best rowing coach in the world the sir alex ferguson of our sport who is used to winning
2309159 in the run up to athens we suffered plenty of disruptions as james cracknell and i were initially going to race in the two man boat
2309160 this current four have stronger ingredients as theyve been training together for many years and if youve got that good background of practice and momentum its a lot easier to prepare for a major event
2309161 we want that the tibetans should stop protesting taking into consideration the long lasting relations of friendship with china
2309162 we wont let the event take place we dont need such a thing in the new federal democratic republic of nepal where women are treated as objects of entertainment
2309163 such contests send the wrong message to society as they emphasise physical beauty rather than intellectual ability
2309164 the event was originally scheduled for 7 august but we have postponed it for the time being
2309165 we are currently in the process of holding dialogue with them so the contest has only been postponed for some time
2309166 abc and most other major carriers reduced its 08 earnings forecast and thus began cutting costs were doing the same on the abc lob side of the house for the broker portal and likely other tools as well will keep you posted if things change
2309167 so cutting costs as in inefficient paper based processes and leveraging incredibly inexpensive web processes
2309168 ha as you know the trouble with spending money to save money is the savings arent typically realized within the current or next immediate fiscal quarter wall street has a severe case of adhd so what seems logical and reasonable isnt always what gets approved and implemented the markets adhd is exacerbated when companies dont hit their forecasts so long term thinking within the company has been spanked and sent to bed without any supper the good news is that free markets are fluid and this too shall pass
2309169 we are talking of millions of people old and young rich and middle class low budget and high budget this is a huge market and everyone wants a finger in the pie
2309170 if we really want to reconstitute ourselves as a nation we have to freely mingle with other nations so travel whenever you can
2309171 mostly domestic tourists so far bengalis are turning to foreign travel in a big way
2309172 these places are nearer to calcutta and so work out cheaper for bengalis than for others in india in some case a package to thailand is less expensive from calcutta than a package to kerala or kashmir
2309173 we live in a high rise apartment and egypt was a consensus destination when we discussed our travel plans in the apartment club
2309174 a woman who allegedly was driving while intoxicated in the sturgis
2309175 excuse me but im lost can you help me find the city jail
2309176 two years ago people were calling for us to buy back shares it just shows how quickly things change
2309177 wait until i get upstairs and see what the analysts have written about us
2309178 a very unsatisfactory situation made more so by the shadow it casts over the good performances across a wide range of our businesses
2309179 i dont want to do this job forever but right now you find me extremely galvanised to the task in hand
2309180 im not complaining about it its just that the speed of change is what caught everyone
2309181 at one level it doesnt affect you youre still interacting with colleagues about the same sorts of issues but the range of levers at your disposal is smaller and the pressures are on different parts of our business
2309182 so to the naked eye not very much has changed but when you get into the detail quite a lot has
2309183 its not entirely unwelcome many of the changes that have come about have been things where people have said this needs to change
2309184 its been the speed and degree of change thats made life difficult in this period of transition
2309185 maybe you have to be a bit of a masochist but its when things are tough that you really really do see organisations perform
2309186 im a great believer in adversity sorting out who the long term winners are going to be
2309187 i pay my taxes why should i be told what to do
2309188 its working because im not having to go down the police station with andrew spending four or five hours at a time
2309189 youre punishing the majority of children who behave for the crimes of a few and potentially those causing the trouble arent even under 16
2309190 if a few adults broke the law you wouldnt impose a curfew on every adult in the community
2309191 like the quality of the air the athletes are due to perform in
2309192 beijing has come up short on the standards it set for itself

2309195 de aangekondigde bouw van nieuwe woningen voor isra lis in oost jeruzalem en de bezette westelijke jordaanoever schaden de geloofwaardigheid van de onderhandelingen die aan de gang zijn met de palestijnen
2309196 de kolonisatiegebieden lopen echter vooruit op de onderhandelingen over het finale statuut en brengen de levensvatbaarheid van een oplossing voor de samenleving van de twee staten in het gedrang
2309197 hes a politician and his life is public but his sex life is none of my concern making this public certainly doesnt help his family which is already dealing with a difficult situation millions and millions of people have affairs every year why do we care about edwards him cheating on his wife doesnt diminish the work he has done on poverty and health care
2309198 another private choice that everyone does anyway and so shouldnt matter
2309199 after all of the attacks the bush administration has gotten based on claims that theyve lied to the american people its curious that this doesnt seem to carry over
2309200 i put together 1 000 people or so to meet with bibi netanyahu and he spoke to us that night
2309201 it was all planned by netanyahu as an affront to mr clinton

2309214 a battle of ideas is going on inside your mind

2309217 se gliela lecco io lei non potr rifiutarsi di ricambiare
2309218 ladies and gentlemen while we give earnestine a brief respite in order to catch her breath it is my very great pleasure to introduce to you our master leatherman our artiste with the crop henri avignon
2309219 for this brief interlude i shall demonstrate the proper ze artistic use of some of the minor tools here oui oui i know most of you already know how to use them but we have some new friends here and even the best of you can learn some new tricks no frankly madam winters your technique has gotten stale i should add you to my dolls here to remind you what a good whipping is but no we shall save that for another time
2309220 it is ze basic tool of the slave owner used both for guidance and for correction it is painful oui but does little serious damage as such it can be used with impunity on the sensitive parts of a slave such as the nipples and the clitoris
2309221 it is also light enough that you can make ze amusing patterns with it turn around my cherie
2309222 this tool also is painful for ze recipient and does not do too much damage to the skin it is wide enough to spread the impact out you see it is much heavier of course and so it can leave deep bruising that will take days to fade ze trick is to overlap your blows so that the damage compounds
2309223 with a fifteen centimetre strap like this one a skilled user can get fifteen strokes in side the mark of the first
2309224 thirty two ah rachel cherie i do hope you let me help in your grand finale
2309225 if im going to spend that long letting you paddle my ass i want to be around afterward to appreciate it
2309226 so crass you can see why she needed to be paddled as she says no one last thing about this strap it can damage the soft tissues so it is safest not to use it on the stomach or around the kidneys unless you wish to cause such damage of course now cherie you will help me with young mercy here oui count my strokes and make sure that i stay within the first mark
2309227 a poor effort you have upset me cherie shall we try again
2309228 mercy is her name and mercy she shall have let us move on
2309229 bien it will do her good to have some balance
2309230 what would be the effect if i were to say whip only one thigh with this strap
2309231 ah you like the asymmetry like ze picasso abstracts oui this is not really the position it is best if you isolate the target you want hmmm if you do it well the bruising is like a pulled muscle yes it restricts movement and she cannot put the weight on it when she sits she will lean to put her weight on the other side mercy turn around and give the master your left foot if you would hold it level monsieur at about waist height
2309232 like that two or three times better if you hit the muscle down the back directly watch her this afternoon but it might be the knee rather than the thigh
2309233 it is now time to welcome earnestine back to center stage for this part of the festivities we like to prepare our stars for their final showing after tenderisation we need to season our star henri will assist us in that process by applying his delicate touch to her skin and then our hosts will baste her in our own special blend of herbs and spices and letting them soak in
2309234 that is an eighteen foot bullwhip that henri has named marie after both the french noblewoman marie antoinette and the first woman he ever killed with it it has a reputation here at the faded lotus of being capable of the most exquisite pain and the most stunning artwork many of the dolls here today have had their major patterns created by marie
2309235 its a mixture of adrenaline stimulants some other anti shock compounds and a nasty little nerve toxin
2309236 generally it keeps you awake alert and responsive theres little point in whipping a woman who has passed out after all
2309237 the nerve toxin is an added extra im told it increases the sensitivity of the pain receptors greatly
2309238 claire winters that was your slave with the runners wasnt it
2309239 noreen yes im afraid that was a bit much for her though so i sent her home
2309240 now that she has been prepared it is time to baste our star and once again our hosts have graciously allowed us to share that with you please form a queue so that everyone who wants one gets a chance to help apply our special blend
2309241 101 really important things you already know but keep forgetting
2309242 wow youre moving to shanghai why you dont like malaysia
2309243 reject catholic doctrines and have been doing so since leaving the catholic church in the sixteenth century
2309244 there is no principled difference with respect to ones relation to ecclesial authority between sola scriptura and solo scriptura in both the individual is his own final authority
2309245 the first protestants thought and said whatever they wanted thumbing their noses at the pope and the catholic bishops under whose ecclesial authority they were
2309246 there is no non arbitrary reason why departing from confessional protestant doctrines must be wrong now
2309247 ok now that the new testament has been written and the canon settled we are going to change the way things operate from now on the rightful bishops are no longer to be determined by listening to those whom we ordain in sacramental succession from the apostles but instead by finding those who agree with your own interpretation of scripture
2309248 ah there it is see the final authority rests with you the individual interpreter you could not receive the testimony of confessional protestantism without determining the truth for yourself
2309249 i indeed would not have believed the gospel had not the authority of the catholic church moved me
2309250 reject catholic doctrines and have been doing so since leaving the catholic church in the sixteenth century
2309251 no one accept us has the right to say where the bulls eye should be you cannot appeal to scripture as a higher law because only rome can tell you what scripture is and what it really means you cannot appeal to church history tradition or historic theology as a higher standard because only rome can tell you what those things really mean you cannot appeal to the early fathers as a higher standard because only rome can tell you what the fathers really mean you cannot appeal to god because rome is the voice of god on earth rome is autonomous so just surrender your bow and arrows and believe whatever she says
2309252 the very first christians did not determine which persons were christs apostles by seeing who taught what they themselves thought must have been christs gospel they determined what christs gospel was by finding those whom christ sent and then listening to their teaching and the second generation of christians did not determine which persons were the bishops by determining who believed and taught what they themselves thought was christs gospel but rather by finding those whom the apostles had authorized and sent and then listening to their teaching and the third generation of christians did the same that is the way christ set up the church
2309253 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you let him be accursed as we have said before so now i say again if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received let him be accursed
2309254 but what anchors us to the ship of christianity is adhering to the church that christ founded read the roman catholic church and then submitting to her teaching as the true doctrine
2309255 when we recognize that the identity of the church is determined by those whom christ authorized and those whom they authorized and those whom they authorized in perpetual succession to the present day unity is achieved not when we all make church in our own image i e in the image of our own interpretation but when we all conform to her image
2309256 magisterium of the moment is understood to be the one true source of revelation
2309257 well what authority was being accepted by luther if not romes
2309258 in this matter two councils have already sent letters to the apostolic see and from thence rescripts have come back the matter is settled causa finite est if only the heresy would cease
2309259 at that even augustine of hippo threatened to resign from now on the only court of appeal was to be the north african council at carthage this case was to be brought up repeatedly in the future as an example of resistance by the episcopate of a national church against roman centralism
2309260 so and so does this the cannons fire and such and such happens
2309261 but what would he say what commands would he give
2309262 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2309263 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2309264 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2309265 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2309266 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2309267 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2309268 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2309269 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2309270 it is pretty clear that when the money travels it travels back to the equity market whenever it can
2309271 were seeing a lot of asset allocation moving back and forth and right now investors dont need the safety of government bonds
2309272 continue to insist that this competition is conducted without political interference
2309273 at this point it is a fair bet that politicians are going to start meddling in the selection process
2309274 bought loans that were on some level just as risky as what was subprime
2309275 we expected credit would continue to deteriorate and it has admittedly even faster than we thought
2309276 no intention to get down below the minimum capital level
2309277 needs to raise capital today not wait and hope for a chance to raise cheaper capital in the future
2309278 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2309279 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
2309280 were receiving kickbacks up to 20 000 a month from some of these hospitals and they were delivering between 30 and 50 patients a month
2309281 the disparity between an economy seat and a business seat is too great to be offset just by miles
2309282 we have a great heritage in racing here at american suzuki
2309283 suzuki has been dominant in the road racing arena for several years and with the introduction of the rm z450 and the help of ricky carmichael roger decoster and our dedicated team weve been able to elevate our position in supercross and motocross to that championship level the signing of chad helps us reinforce our position and goals for the future of suzuki racing we are very happy to have chad join our team
2309284 im extremely excited to be starting a new chapter in my career and to be working with roger decoster and team rockstar makita suzuki
2309285 it will be a whole new experience for me which im really looking forward to i rode suzukis for a good part of my amateur career and have some great memories from then and now im excited to be racing the new suzuki efi rm z450 i believe this bike and my new team have great potential and i couldnt be happier
2309286 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2309287 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2309288 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2309289 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2309290 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2309291 the avatar is actually going to get on a treadmill and get on a bicycle and perform these activities in second life
2309292 what were seeing in second life is the beginning of serious interest on the part of health care professionals theyre interested in how it can be leveraged for a variety of things
2309293 lots of people see visions and hear voices yet for students and health professionals its hard for them to understand what the experience is like
2309294 its not so much your avatar losing weight or eating healthier its whether these health behaviors in second life translate to your real life
2309295 obese people are stigmatized they dont like meeting in groups or coming out about obesity
2309296 theres a strong likelihood theyll feel more comfortable meeting in second life having an avatar with a different name
2309297 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2309298 according to mayor m subramanian the dumping of debris is high in zone ten comprising posh residential areas including raja annamalaipuram mylapore adyar tiruvanmiyur and velacherry due to the real estate boom there the objective of collecting fine was not to make money but to ensure that waste is not dumped along the roadside
2309299 the supposed satisfaction to our deepest longing just fades away something has evaded us
2309300 our life long longing is no mere neurotic fancy but the truest index of our real situation
2309301 what is the source of this persistent gnawing that refuses to give the heart rest why despite all we have do so many people find themselves miserable it seems true happiness is always around the next corner just out of our grasp over the growl of the next hill to be found in the next job the next relationship the new house and the next experience we seek perpetual novelty to punctuate the dreariness of the life that can so easily become devoid of expectation excitement and wonder we long for something more than we have in the belief that when we have a certain experience the longing for this vague something will be satisfied
2309302 the loneliest moment in life is when you have just experienced what you thought would deliver the ultimate and it has let you down
2309303 many scenarios led me to the point of trouble i had everything in terms of materialistic things 1m house a mercedes a porsche i had everything money could buy but i wasnt happy i was quite lonely and i was searching for something else
2309304 you god have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you
2309305 this sense of eternity has been planted there by god himself and is part of our human makeup our yearning is also an echo of the eden an inescapable reminder of a time in human history with a longing that was satisfied when human experience was bliss and the soul found joy and contentment in relationship with its creator it is to put it another way a latent memory of an experience that we long to renew that of knowing god himself no matter how hard we try to escape this reality human beings have an irresistible longing that is correlated to god
2309306 the lover of money will not be satisfied with money nor the lover of wealth with gain this also is vanity
2309307 its plain to see around us that there are so many people searching for comfort and happiness thats why there are so many turning to drink and drugs i turned to god and asked for his help and he gave it to me

2309311 the excessive skepticism shown towards the bible by important historical schools in the 18th and 19th centuries certain phases of which will appear periodically has been progressively discredited discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details and is brought increased for commissioned a guy of the bible as a historical source
2309312 there can be no doubt that archeology has confirmed the substantial historicity of the old testament tradition
2309313 we may rest assured that the consonantal text of the hebrew bible though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other near eastern literature
2309314 the bible towers in content above all earlier religious literature and it towers just as impressively over all subsequent literature in the direct simplicity of its message and the catholicity of its appeal to men of all lands and times
2309315 the bible has continually been proven to be accurate on all fronts
2309316 why does he ignore the facts and claim that it is december
2309317 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2309318 when dealing with people let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic we are dealing with creatures of emotion creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity
2309319 i had motives for not wanting the world to have a meaning and consequently assumed that it had none and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption the philosopher who finds no meaning in the world is not concerned exclusively with a problem in pure metaphysics he is also concerned to prove that there is no valid reason why he personally should not do as he wants to do for myself as no doubt for most of my friends the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation from a certain system of morality we objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom the supporters of this system claimed that it embodied the meaning the christian meaning they insisted of the world there was one admirably simple method of confuting these people and justifying ourselves in our erotic revolt we would deny that the world had any meaning whatever most ignorance is vincible ignorance we dont know because we dont want to know it is our will that decides how and upon what subjects we shall use our intelligence no philosophy is completely disinterested the pure love of truth is always mingled to some extent with the need consciously or unconsciously felt by even the noblest and the most intelligent philosophers
2309320 the christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and left untried
2309321 ive learned that we must hold everything loosely because when i grip it tightly it hurts when the father pries my fingers loose and takes it from me
2309322 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2309323 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2309324 anybody who works in the aviation environment knows about fod knows its a risk and concorde is the ultimate manifestation of that risk
2309325 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
2309326 i am sure a lot more people would like to buy it but currently cant do so
2309327 the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
2309328 with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009

2309330 theres a line in the sand just below 117 if you close below that it signals traders are giving up on the bull market in oil
2309331 subsequent rallies may take us higher but the highs for the year have probably been put in
2309332 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon before we really see any change in driving habits
2309333 it is a report card on the general financial health of the city an outside group has looked at us and said youve done things reasonably well your economy is doing good it also says we have some stresses
2309334 is very strong for a city its especially strong for a county
2309335 counties are weaker on the finance side because they are so dependent on the state
2309336 the upgrade primarily reflects the decade long and likely continuing steady upward trend in the citys assessed valuation the relative mildness of the current economic downturn which demonstrates the citys fundamental economic strength and resilience and the citys now improved prospects for reduced fiscal volatility
2309337 while real estate prices in san francisco have eased in recent months and the number of transactions has declined property tax delinquency rates remain quite modest and outstanding assessment appeals have not grown
2309338 particularly due to continued rapid baseline expenditure growth the citys intent to backfill most state budget cuts to health and welfare programs and recent additional local voter imposed spending mandates
2309339 i think they are being a little more generous now they dont want to be attacked
2309340 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2309341 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2309342 paying attention to your credit is going to be paramount for people
2309343 advances the strong california policy favoring open competition and employee freedom
2309344 those have been drivers of the states economy especially in the technology area
2309345 an employer cannot by contract restrain a former employee from engaging in his or her profession trade or business
2309346 as long as you dont steal trade secrets or confidential information you can do what you want
2309347 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs
2309348 for the majority of companies if somebody really wants to hack into your system they still can
2309349 but anybody in your network can bring in a wireless access point and plug it in and companies arent able to monitor that as extensively as they should
2309350 youre dealing with hundreds or thousands of machines and applications with dependencies across each other
2309351 ok there may be a bubble bursting in the east bay but not in san francisco or on the peninsula
2309352 how much would you ask for that watch if you were to sell it
2309353 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
2309354 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
2309355 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
2309356 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
2309357 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
2309358 not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it
2309359 the commission has concluded that the present transaction would not raise competition concerns
2309360 the concerns about a weakening economy always run to worries about the financials and then you add some negative news to them on their own and youve got what weve got today
2309361 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2309362 youre seeing hedge funds move away from the commodities sector and toward the financial sector
2309363 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2309364 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2309365 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2309366 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2309367 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2309368 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2309369 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2309370 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2309372 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2309373 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2309374 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2309375 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally

2309384 since the fourth of july all those interested and enthusiastic buyers have moved off the sidelines and are moving into the contract process
2309385 the southern parts of the city and we are straddling visitacion valley and bayview have seen more pronounced effects from these issues
2309386 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2309387 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2309388 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2309389 it is important that these cases go forward at the pace that justice requires
2309390 prosecutors cannot should not accelerate cases but should try them with as much dispatch as they can recognizing that timely justice is appropriate both for the accused and society
2309391 mr hamdan is about to make a phone call home to yemen
2309392 and i think it will be a much easier one than one that some other folks have to make to dc
2309393 how feasible is it that the majority of u s food consumption be shifted to a local mode how long would it take and would it necessarily be a good thing
2309394 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest
2309395 the highest form of luxury is now growing it yourself or paying other people to grow it for you this has become fashion
2309396 a lot of expensive imported food with little thought about where it came from
2309397 its like the first time you start drinking good red wine and you realize what you were drinking was so bad you cant go back to it its that same way with vegetables
2309398 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
2309399 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2309400 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2309401 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2309402 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2309403 ive had a couple of dings this year but ive been able to take some days off i know i have a few years left hopefully it is with san diego
2309404 i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2309405 were in the process of getting it all signed and everything and thats all i can say right now
2309406 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2309407 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2309408 although tenors do have rather big egos and like to come and sing as loudly as possible so that their voices reach the mountains
2309409 when pavarotti was too weak to come to our studio to record il canto which romano wrote for him romano took the microphone to pavarottis home and they recorded in his bedroom instead
2309410 we were going against the current as its very rare to build studios these days when music can be recorded simply with a microphone and a computer
2309411 like many umbrian houses the villa is one part modern one part antique but this room which could also easily be converted into a great cinema or salon lent itself perfectly to being a recording studio as it is a glass enclosed diamond shape with perfect acoustics
2309412 we are so insulated that we have watched peacocks flirting mating and having babies on the lawn outside the studio oblivious to the big sounds coming from inside
2309413 my family built about seven homes in montreal so i have no fear of renovation or living in dust
2309414 i used to hate it when my dad was shovelling rocks or drilling something while my friends and i were playing outside as a child but now i owe it to him
2309415 but hes a discreet person and he believes in creating good quality things that last good wine good olive oil and good music
2309416 even though this house is very big it is warm and inviting people come here and forget all their stress they just become the artist part of themselves
2309417 theres a huge empty farm here which could become a fantastic wine producing area the potential is enormous you could turn the place into a luxurious agri tourism retreat producing 40 000 bottles of wine a year and it would be lucrative the white red and sparkling wines we have produced would sell for up to 30 a bottle
2309418 but were all going to be learning a little about diving in the next few weeks
2309419 we all think he can win he has as good a chance as anybody there will be no one out there that hes competing against that he hasnt beaten already he is excited but determined to do the best he can for himself his family and his country
2309420 thats a good sign because he usually calls when hes homesick i dont want to be phoning him too much because he might start missing home which affects his training
2309421 ive been in touch with them and theyre loving it the british diving team is a close group so well all be cheering for them
2309422 people are coming and giving it a go thats what sport and the olympics is about people being inspired to take part
2309423 id certainly like to see sir steve redgrave perform this
2309424 these paddles by the way are very very heavy we appreciate the precision and energy of these movements
2309425 the olympics is a chance to help foreigners to better understand our country
2309426 one with an even number plate one with an odd
2309427 when i was a child we stole food from the dogs bowl
2309428 the olympics shows how much power we now have the change has been huge we used to have oil lamps now we have electricity
2309429 coming to the olympics is a chance in a 100 years even though the earthquake destroyed many houses i felt confident in my heart because our economy is good and i have enough money to bring my father and daughter to beijing
2309430 i feel china has a bright future we are hard working and united so i believe things will get even better than they are now
2309431 this shows the greatness of our 5 000 years of history
2309432 there is a real warmth people are very proactive about welcoming us
2309433 i think they are delighted to be showcasing the olympics we have had people come up to us in the street touching us holding hands its always nice when people meet you half way and here it feels as if people are meeting us all the way
2309434 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2309435 in the markets conditions which many of us had already described as the worst in a generation took a turn for the worse
2309436 one of the worst fannie mae has experienced on the debt and equity markets
2309437 neither of these companies have properly provisioned for what were heading into
2309438 this thing is going to get worse and last longer and deeper than they originally thought
2309439 the financial sector crisis is now spilling into the real economy its not out of the woods
2309440 ive never seen a country spend so much time showing itself off
2309441 you americans think about politics but to us this is more about sports
2309442 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
2309443 you want to scream hellfire and damnation as soon as you get in here
2309444 twenty years ago most of these items would have ended up in skips and landfill now we hardly ever turn anything away there is so much less snobbery in architectural antiques you just need to know what you like and these are items to be used the coffee tables we sell should have coffee cups put on them if it gets a heat ring you either sand it off or live with it
2309445 we get a lot of people coming in who dont know very much about architectural history so we are always here to help and can tell you what kind of materials or items were used during that era
2309446 even with the victorians for instance they used items from a lot of periods and styles so it isnt as purist as many people think so you should go for what you want and how you live after all if you have a tv and phone thats hardly edwardian
2309447 we started off with a 300 year old barn that had been dismantled and all the parts numbered so it could be reconstructed
2309448 then we started on the main house we have bought choir stalls which we have turned into desks gothic arches that we have converted into mirrors a pulpit canopy which now sits above our aga and had a four poster bed constructed out of oak panels
2309449 salvage yards can be quite expensive the decorative antiques and textiles fair in battersea park london is held three times a year its part of a new type of smaller architectural outfits
2309450 dont just think oh i must have that ill make it fit at all costs because you cant and youll end up with your home looking like a theme pub
2309451 i found it in france we cant date it precisely but it appears to be late roman perhaps fifth century
2309452 we shipped it here in two articulated lorries the buyer is going to use it as a water feature in his garden hes spending about 250 000 on the garden in the tradition of the old industrial landowners who contracted inigo jones to design for them
2309453 about 10 years ago i bought a victorian terraced house which had everything of character taken out
2309454 i wanted to get it back to how it would have originally been so it involved lots of trips to salvage yards they are brilliant absolute treasure troves
2309455 its important to choose the right yard because just as your neighbours houses might give you ideas for the original component local salvage yards will have stuff from local homes
2309456 in bath theres a place called walcot reclamation that spends a lot of time cleaning and restoring their stuff so you dont need to do that yourself but you are paying for the privilege
2309457 we plant trees we sow seeds the land turns green
2309458 across the federation experts agree that a god exists b hes on our side and c he wants us to win
2309459 the physical world is but a lace veil strewn over the irradiating worlds of the unseen

2309461 man is connected with all living creatures and in this respect is gladdened by their happiness and saddened by their pain a person with conscience who feels sorrow and pity at the weeping of a motherless hungry child surely feels pleasure at a mothers compassion for her child surely he is pleased and happy
2309462 who do you think you are to challenge these famous philosophers you are like a mere fly and yet you meddle in the flight of eagles
2309463 the matter in which they got drowned did not even wet my toes
2309464 the reality of the universe and of all beings is based on the divine names the reality of every being is based on one name or on many all sciences and arts are also based on and rely upon a name the true science of philosophy is based on the name of all wise true medicine on the name of healer and geometry on the name of determiner and so on and in the same way that all the sciences are based on and come to an end in a name the realities of all arts and sciences and of all human attainments are based on the divine names indeed one group of the most learned of the saints stated that the divine names constitute the true reality of things while the essences of things are only shadows of that reality they said too that even only apparently as many as twenty manifestations of the impresses of the divine names may be seen on a single living creature
2309465 man acts as a mirror to the divine names the imprint of which are upon him there are more than seventy names the impresses of which are apparent in mans comprehensive nature these have been described to a degree at the start of the third stopping place of the thirty second word for example through his creation man shows the names of maker and creator through his being most excellent of patterns the names of most merciful and all compassionate and through the fine way he is nurtured and raised the names of all generous and granter of favors and so on he shows the differing impresses of different names through all his members and faculties all his organs and limbs all his subtle senses and faculties all his feelings and emotions that is to say just as among the names there is a greatest name so among the impresses of those names there is a greatest impress and that is man o you who considers himself to be a true man read yourself otherwise it is possible you will be a man who is either animal like or inanimate
2309466 god has created man in the image of the most merciful
2309467 a persons actions were just as determined as those of a billiard ball planet or star human actions are determined beyond their control by physical and psychological laws everything is determined the beginning as well as the end by forces over which we have no contro1 it is determined for the insect as well as for the star human beings vegetables or cosmic dust we all dance to a mysterious tune intoned in the distance by an invisible player
2309468 a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe
2309469 the most fundamental laws of physics such as newtons laws of motion or quantum mechanics are in fact emergent they are properties of large assemblages of matter and when their exactness is examined too closely it vanishes into nothing
2309470 we are able to prove in these simple cases that the organization can acquire meaning and life of its own and begin to transcend the parts from which it is made what physical science thus has to tell us is that the whole being more than the sum of its parts is not merely a concept but a physical phenomenon nature is regulated not only by a microscopic rule base but by powerful and general principles of organization
2309471 physical law cannot generally be anticipated by pure thought but must be discovered experimentally
2309472 love is the cause of the universes existence and it is the bond of the universe
2309473 mercy makes the hen birds search out the food and bring it their wingless frail chicks in the nests at the tops of trees he subjugates the hungry lions to her cubs so she does not eat the meat she finds but gives it to them
2309474 the existence and reality of a boundless mercy is as clearly apparent in the universe as the light of the sun as certainly as light testifies to the sun so this extensive mercy testifies to a most merciful and compassionate one behind the veil of the unseen
2309475 the compassion of all mothers is but a flash of the manifestation of divine mercy
2309476 all the evidences for knowledge are evidences also for the existence of the all knowing one since it is impossible and precluded that there should be an attribute without the one it qualifies all the proofs of knowledge form a powerful and completely certain supreme proof of the pre eternal all knowing ones necessary existence
2309477 how can a feature that does not exist in its basic structural elements exist in its whole
2309478 in the course of life the spirit gradually changes its body clothes and at the time of death it is suddenly undressed it has been established through certain conjecture indeed through observation that the body subsists though the spirit
2309479 if a simple physical phenomenon can become effectively independent of the more fundamental laws from which it descends so can we i am carbon but i need not have been i have a meaning transcending the atoms from which i am made

2309494 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic make up the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2309495 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted
2309496 in the evening standard of august 6 we stated that the duke of edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition

2309571 ive found my only success in getting this chant to stick is to know exactly what each word means and try to link the meaning of the text with the melody or texture of the phrases
2309572 why does humility sing gaudete rejoice at the very bottom of her range if i have an answer to that ill be able to remember the phrase structure
2309573 if you can read hildegards original notation you know theres a clear hierarchy to the notes in her chants something thats often lost in transcription

2309575 the other night i actually had a dream in which ordo made an appearance

2309588 we undertook this because of our interest in the history of restoration
2309589 this piece has been apart and put back together several times
2309590 how comfortable are we after all these restorations to show a statue without a head
2309591 i am convinced we are dealing with a statue of dionysus
2309592 we imagined it to be more ugly from the photographs and fragments
2309593 what struck me most over the past two days was the quality of the sculpture its so much more than just fragments
2309594 will be to infill some of the fractures so as to make them less disturbing
2309595 frequently statues are carved from a single block of marble
2309596 when you consider the grave misfortunes that have become some of our sculptures
2309597 the general consensus is that the statue is more likely dionysus rather than antinuous

2309619 the evidence satisfies williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2309620 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club

2309622 the issuing of a nsw supreme court order in respect of those responsibilities should provide a stark reminder to sonny bill of the importance of him observing the terms of his contract
2309623 it is a very serious matter for such an order to be granted and anyone who breaks an order of the nsw supreme court would face contempt proceedings from that court

2309637 we were pretty shocked yesterday to see how reckless moveon was being in our district they clearly had no regard for our campaign whatsoever which is incredibly disappointing michael has been on the record from the beginning as supporting drilling and a lot of his biggest supporters work for major oil and gas companies and most democrats in the district are in favor of drilling as well
2309638 moveons opposition to drilling is 100 percent wrong and so is john culbersons opposition to investment in renewable energy we need a balanced solution to our energy challenges that includes both drilling for domestic oil and investment in renewables we have to do it all

2309742 the buyers agent also needs to have an incentive and our company recognizes it prices have dropped and the glut of homes is forcing good homes to languish this program will always set the bar higher for those homes in the 25g program
2309743 if i was a buyer and my agent showed 2 similar homes id buy the 25g house if that was the only difference

2309746 the females got the game and they moved the wall in the direction you would expect
2309747 they appeared motivated to succeed at the game the males were just a lot more motivated to succeed
2309748 financial support and needs for the rest of her life
2309749 it isnt exactly a joyful time in america right now 4 gas people who cant afford vacations wild prices on food and so forth
2309750 theyre really looking for something to cheer for this american team these olympic athletes certainly offer that the television audience has really suffered of late from a paucity of great scripted drama theyre about to get 17 days and nights of unscripted drama
2309751 its once every four years at most for many of these competitors once in a lifetime
2309752 and many of the events go by in an eyeblink so you think of the drama involved in preparing your entire life and then intensely for several years prior to this event and maybe youre in an event that lasts 10 seconds or less or lasts just a few minutes and it is this which will define you for your entire career i think that raises the stakes and raises the drama and its why so many people around the world americans included pay attention to events at the olympics
2309753 our primary aim is as the sole rights holder in the united states were the only way that you can see the major events of the games
2309754 so were not going to cavalierly blow out sporting events to show news but if its really news were going to cover it and in the major venues we have our own cameras so if something develops during the opening ceremony we have our own cameras and we also have both news and sports people ready to comment on that
2309755 this notion that america is more xenophobic than other nations i dont think is true if you actually analyze tv from country to country and i know for a fact since ive been involved which dates to 1988 that the proportion of focus on non american athletes has increased
2309756 are americans somewhat more interested in american performers of course they are but we dont insult the intelligence of the audience theyre interested in any good story wherever it may appear it isnt just that americans tend to place or will place competitors in all 34 of the sports but americans tend to excel in the sports that are of the greatest interest to americans and the ones that we tend to show the most in prime time if you were to watch olympics tv in pakistan you wouldnt believe how much badminton they would show you wouldnt believe if you came to china several olympics ago how much platform diving and table tennis you would have seen because thats what they excelled at
2309757 just four years ago in athens we presented only five sports plus the opening and closing ceremonies in hd
2309758 and they were truly boutique presentations they had separate groups of announcers they had limited cameras and in just four years time to be able to go to the point where all 34 olympic sports from all 37 olympic venues throughout china will be 100 percent in hd its really a remarkable evolution of the technology the thing for me thats so amazing is how quickly the technology has matured so not only are the handheld and the hard cameras in hd but even the smallest lipstick camera the camera thats embedded in the target at archery that gives you that point of view of the arrow coming directly at the target even that camera is in hd
2309759 rich with information schedules listings news bios of the athletes
2309760 it really turns the corner in 2008 and goes from a companion of our broadcast coverage to part of our coverage it explodes with 25 different live sports over 2 200 hours well essentially take every sport and offer it on demand well take the best of our television coverage every day and offer it as encores and of course well have a huge volume of highlights all of this at the fingertips of the olympic fan
2309761 in barcelona the spanish contingent had only a handful of events in which they could contend
2309762 as prideful as the greeks were about hosting the olympics and having it return to its birthplace in athens they had only a handful of moments to shine well the chinese were second to the americans on the gold medal chart in athens in 2004 theyve been building and building for this when liu xiang takes to the track in the 110 meter hurdles when yao ming leads the chinese team against the americans in their very first game in the second day of competition of the olympics this is going to be like a super bowl atmosphere and that is not an overstatement i think those of you who know me know that i try to stay away from hype and overstatement this will absolutely be mega big in china and that will add to the atmosphere and the feeling of anticipation and tension and excitement that surrounds these olympics
2309763 and you dont stop if the stage cracks in half the walls catch on fire or if your water breaks
2309764 i try to find my inner light and lure it out with bait which is mostly beer

2309776 those rodeo cowboys aint real cowboys bulls are for breedin not for ridin there aint really no cowboys north of texas
2309777 the media and the government love to criticize the oil industry and talk about a windfall profits tax
2309778 why us why not put one on the software guys or tiger woods
2309779 the democrats dont know a damn thing about our industry

2309785 but its a general christian metaphor that the soul is constantly under attack from the
2309786 when men abandon reason they find not only that their emotions cannot guide them but that they can experience no emotions save one terror
2309787 hey thats a pretty good quote and point which is derived from it
2309788 if you dont like what is on tv then turn it off
2309789 as long as there is man there will be war
2309790 but if this charge is true that she wasnt a virgin on her wedding night and evidence of the girls virginity is not found they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death because she committed a crime against israel by her unchasteness in her fathers house thus shall you purge the evil from your midst
2309791 anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes for i will stir up the medes against babylon and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off the attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows they will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children
2309792 oh but a lot of the old testament is not looked at literally in most of todays religions
2309793 for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass the law until all is accomplished whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
2309794 clearly the old testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself none other then jesus said so
2309795 oh noes if its made into a video game it means people are making fun of us
2309796 woman receives collect phone call from god video games are terrorist claims christian post
2309797 well it turns out we arent the center of the universe
2309798 i disagree with that persons groups interpretation opinion of x religion and therefore they are perverting said religion
2309799 arrogant elitist superiority complex toting individuals who constantly feel the urge to inform everyone who disagrees with their perfect and flawless grasp of logic and reality that they dont know how to think independantly or be rational because it makes them feel better about themselves to put others down
2309800 although we consider movies television and music entertainment they are actually infotainment
2309801 impart values and information about the world maybe information about life that your kids are not ready to process and absorb
2309802 video games computers cell phones teen magazines music tv amp movies all of which fall under the umbrella of entertainment and all are likely perpetrators
2309803 there are no doors on the floor there is no nothing on the floor
2309804 just a minute i need to find a save point
2309805 so how come they dont make smash bros for ps3
2309806 so apparently theres this game called mahtle gayer solloid or something i dont know im not into these things
2309807 no this is an xbox you retard not a playstation
2309808 while i agree that non gamers probably have a brighter future compared to hardcore gamers
2309809 i wouldnt presume to lecture anyone about how they spend their free time though you might consider that many of us not gaming are commenting on video game articles on digg or commenting on video game articles on digg
2309810 we the non gamers are the ones commenting on video game articles on digg
2309811 taking business classes networking working extra hours and getting jobs that make us your boss
2309812 the sims is stupid you should just live in real life
2309813 3 control yourself that game pad is not a rock and you are not an angry gorilla smashing the buttons with all your ferocious might is not going to make your character any faster stronger or smarter it will probably break our 50 piece of equipment however so just stop
2309814 25 annoying things about people with lives from the perspective of those who never live
2309815 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2309816 in addition credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience in july we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves
2309817 i would feel differently if cuddy was earning his keep before the injury
2309818 not bad for a guy who was supposed to be mopping up clubhouse floors right about now
2309819 any chance smith could land a quality bullpen arm through waivers
2309820 its not a question of cuddy over ruiz its a questions of cuddy over one of span young gomez in the outfield
2309821 not sure if sending him down will do much defensively offensively maybe but not on defense
2309822 could he improve in aaa yes does he help this team win games now yes
2309823 cuddyer had one year where his vorp was above replacement player
2309824 the rest of your post used numbers from this year again ill direct you to my post earlier in this same thread cuddyers month of june 291 385 481 in 91 plate appearances he had a bad month of may it happens to players
2309825 hes going to be juggling some world series rings and the season will be over at that point so hell have all winter to recover
2309826 its just like people ripping on gardy for putting punto in the lineup for a few days immediately after getting off the dl a guy cant earn his way back in the lineup without actually playing
2309827 imo the ripping came when gardy inserted punto while harris was doing well instead of waiting for harris to struggle
2309828 thats where you lose me pete cuddy has been regressing since the beginning of last year one hot spell in june cant change that
2309829 carlos gutierrez has given up 4 er in 12 1 innings as a reliever for a 2 92 era so far at fort myers
2309830 so your telling me theres a chance we could get a reliever from minors in the next few years
2309831 theres a chance we could get a reliever from minors in the next few years
2309832 i cant believe only one person suggested dumping lamb when cuddyer comes back
2309833 any names you can throw at us of prospects that could be the next
2309834 is it unthinkable to convert humber and or duensing to relief in your view
2309835 is he your brother in law or something and if he is i would deny it if i were you
2309836 pridie is playing too well and covers vast swathes of territory in the field
2309837 maybe youre a gruff looking guy but a softy on the inside as evidenced by your fluffy poodle or pampered yorkshire and youre perfectly comfortable with your dogs demeanor and secure about your preference
2309838 perhaps your refined elegance and business pedigree doesnt quite match up with your scruffy looking terrier or rowdy jack russell so you cant always judge a book by its cover but the type of dog certainly may reveal who the person is within or what they aspire to be
2309839 while many women will contend that they simply enjoy putting a cute coat on their dog many men will view that woman as high maintenance
2309840 now not every man will be scared off by that but to many men that screams that the woman will spend spend spend their money and that they prefer designer brands over generic
2309841 even though dogs have 220 million smell receptors to our 5 million im not talking literally sniff ing you a good date but trust your dogs instincts
2309842 look for the receptiveness of your dog being comfortable around your potential date
2309843 so take your dog with you everywhere you can in order to meet people and pause when in view of a potential date to make yourself available for small talk
2309844 i remember one occasion waking up and having to squeeze my face and my chest and thinking to myself am i still alive
2309845 im hallucinating i thought i could see a pile of oyster shells
2309846 i was let outside and saw the sun and the sky for the first time in 48 hours my senses were overwhelmed totally and utterly by the sights sounds and smells
2309847 it was an amazing experience that was very much worth going through once it taught me to appreciate my senses and all forms of interaction
2309848 our results suggest that genetic differences in signals mediated by crh may amplify or soften the developmental effects that childhood abuse can have effects that can raise the risk of depression in adults
2309849 low res is cool in the same way that hd is cool its about the way its used hd isnt so wonderful on its own
2309850 the image itself is so crystal clear it can disguise the fact that the elements around it are not so great
2309851 those pixels in cell phone video are nice they can have a really beautiful kaleidoscope effect
2309852 the luminosity of the screen and the blue light make it seem like its always late at night also the person in it is always alone
2309853 even if its a party scene its really about the person in front
2309854 we got a submission that was a guy jumping out of a plane
2309855 even though it has a red light they dont know its on
2309856 theres a richness to it because its normally used for still images
2309857 there used to be two different lenses for still and video
2309858 were seeing the beginning of hd video in point and shoot cameras cell phone video will become like pixelvision but therell be literally hundreds of devices itll be a playground for filmmakers
2309859 my winnipeg is being able to use your cars heater and air conditioner on the same day
2309860 were well along with the drainage and irrigation work on the front nine
2309861 things are moving right along and id expect the seeding will begin in the next four weeks
2309862 it had been dry but we need it to dry out a little you expect some rain and i live in a farming community so i have to wear two hats on that issue
2309863 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2309864 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2309865 i think its safe to say that john edwards probably will not have a speaking role at the convention
2309866 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2309867 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family and thats all i have to say
2309868 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2309869 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2309870 the united states is engaged in an effort with both of these parties we urge both parties to resolve this peacefully and refrain from violence
2309871 we also urge all parties to engage in direct talks
2309872 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2309873 they are unhappy with our closeness with the united states with the north atlantic treaty organization with the west in general
2309874 theyve always told us well hit at you because youre so close to the united states
2309875 its not about georgia anymore its about america its values
2309876 this is essentially a european problem however it is important that the united states stay engaged because after all it is a clash between a great power seeking to throw its weight around and to oppose the legitimate rights of sovereign georgia to defend itself
2309877 the u s is looking to streamline the command and control by making mckiernan essentially in charge of all u s forces in afghanistan so that one person can deploy them in support of the overall mission
2309878 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2309879 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2309880 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2309881 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2309882 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2309883 he will not be in the general population hell have his own cell and no direct contact with other inmates
2309884 its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant this court should be outraged
2309885 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2309886 we got the deal back on track it wasnt a spur of the moment willy nilly i can frolic in canada
2309887 i think its the most extreme measure he can take
2309888 judge giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated
2309889 because of the separate legal process under way before the governor the governor will not offer any reaction to ongoing criminal matters involving the mayor
2309890 we have known at least since magritte that when we look at an image of a pipe we are regarding not a real pipe but one that has been re presented the pipe as such isnt there it isnt present instead it is depicted as being absent
2309891 even paris hilton had an energy plan that shes talking about
2309892 we could do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2309893 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2309894 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2309895 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
2309896 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2309897 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2309898 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2309899 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2309900 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2309901 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2309902 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2309903 this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law
2309904 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
2309905 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2309906 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2309907 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions
2309908 with this speech bush is trying to address two polar issues easing the controversy created by those who oppose his visit during the games and simultaneously maintaining americas strategy with china
2309909 remember it was not all that long ago they were in the middle of the cultural revolution with people getting put up against a wall and basically knocked off
2309910 what we are seeing now is oil off equities are up and thats dragging treasury yields up
2309911 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2309912 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2309913 theres going to be more speculation of ecb rate cuts later this year
2309914 in southeast asia asean has become less prominent on the radar screen of investors who are more focussed on opportunities in china and india several asean countries are pre occupied with domestic economic and political problems however all asean countries know that we must work together resolutely as a group singapore will do our part but we must also maintain our reputation in a turbulent region as an economy that is competitive a society that is cohesive and a government that is honest and competent
2309915 mama dont go to the dim dont go to the dim
2309916 we think the poster sets the right tone and provides our female customers the information they need which is namely that they shouldnt tolerate such criminal behavior and that they should report it
2309917 its a message that not only applies to women but also to men who may witness such behavior
2309918 the possibility of instigating this type of unwelcome behavior is far outweighed by putting out the message that this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the system and is viewed by us and the nypd as being an extremely serious crime
2309919 in and of itself the card may not stop all of it but hopefully we can help put a dent in these occurrences
2309920 the most common indicators where stations received failing grades include the presence of exposed wiring the cleanliness and condition of station ceilings the presence of tactile warning strips indicating platform edges water leakage on ceilings water leakage on walls and cleanliness and condition of station walls
2309921 join with nyc transit in a mutually beneficial effort to create a positive subway experience for users
2309922 the presence of a subway station within walking distance adds great value to any development and increases the use of this transportation service as such new development and redevelopment should share in the care and maintenance of this important asset of the community
2309923 neighborhood corporate partnerships are formed to financially support capital improvements and maintenance of stations community residents and commercial establishments should have the opportunity to participate in the preservation of their local subway station
2309924 a social utility that connects you with the people around you
2309925 were talking about the set of connections that everyone has in real life

2309939 hey thats really impressive can i take a closer look at it
2309940 it looks like youre yelling the word shake though instead of performing the action
2309941 maybe some reverse seti sort of sos will reach someone out there and theyll come help us

2309954 am i the only one that thinks this is a bad idea
2309955 theres a bunch of aliens predators attacking some people and said people need to survive
2309956 deep in the koopa galaxy in an abandoned sewage treatment plant a crack team of plumbers special ops is sent to rescue a missing detachment of princesses only to come up against a force that is humanoid in that dinosaur type of way but definitely not human after brutally murdering the stuffed animal the tough polyester filled member of the team and maiming toad the groups geeky operations strategist the entity shows itself to be a terrifying bastard shaped like a huge grotesque version of a dinosaur turtle with a lion like mouth the teams fearless leader mario quickly realizes that if he doesnt stop the creature no one will and that perhaps this battle in addition to saving the human race will help him atone for his recent 500 games that have left his series completely diluted
2309957 listen fellows i am not religious i never went to church as a girl or repeated prayers or hymns over and over again my sacred texts are alien aliens predator the terminator and total recall
2309958 i hope we have something in place or well have tons of spammers

2309961 hey lets take a simple idea like a movie but lets it up and make it complicated yeah now we can make unoriginal comments about movies for the world to see right from the comfort of our own homes this is great were geniuses
2309962 if heath was alive it would be just another batman movie i know fanboys wont admit it but his death caused all this euphoria and propaganda
2309963 its also worthy of note that the cost of film ticket prices over the past 20 years has risen faster than the rate of inflation so measuring a films popularity in dollars worth of ticket sales is even more inaccurate
2309964 i am a kinetic learner which means i learn and mentally perform best when i am moving

2309987 weve known each other for 12 years and gone through a few things as players and coaches
2309988 weve done our coaching badges together and we have the same philosophy of how football should be played
2309989 eddies got loads of experience in terms of coaching and me too obviously not as much as some managers who have been in the job for 20 years but weve got enough
2309990 its an ambitious club and personally i am very ambitious so i like that and hopefully we can work on the longer term
2309991 ive lost a couple of important players who were here last season so we will have to see how well we can replace them and get on with them
2309992 there is a little bit of money available to spend but in league one the financial resources are limited

2309997 guignet withdrew in race 1 and he took advantage of his newer tyres to finish with a great performance overall we achieved two maxter double podiums and this is an excellent omen seven weeks before the world championship i feel that the maranello team has never been so motivated
2309998 davide fore was in 13th position in the championship when he came here and concluded the season in 4th place it was therefore an excellent weekend for maranello which remains one the world leaders in braga all of our pilots fought hard as shown by the performances by patrick fontner in kf1 and james thorp in kf2 the team will do its best to move along the same direction and get ready for important deadlines in all international categories in the best possible conditions
2309999 but we had to make up for changing track adhesion conditions with a mix of dunlop kf2 and bridgestone kf1 tyres
