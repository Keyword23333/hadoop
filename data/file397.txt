3970000 ja liefje jij bent verwekt op mijn verjaardag het mooiste cadeautje dat ik me kon voorstellen jij was een echt 1 april grapje
3970001 he was only expert at expressing what he did not feel
3970002 orgel experienced without knowing it the gratitude we feel toward one who envies us
3970003 lies were not lies his intention was to strike the imagination
3970004 a prototypically french novella irreducibly classical ruthlessly analytical and so thoroughly disabused that it is hard to believe anyone so young could have written it
3970005 winning back to back olympics is an incredible achievement so hats off to him
3970006 two medals is a good showing for anybody there are a lot of people walking around this pool with no medals
3970007 every car on the road in the u s powered by hydrogen produced from clean sources of energy by the end of 2020
3970008 didnt really have st as the name when we engaged in the process we were just calling it a sport truck
3970009 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
3970010 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
3970011 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
3970012 reinvent themselves and figure out new ways to get by in life
3970013 if we are really in a pearl harbor moment then we have to figure out a way to do it
3970014 we just have to design vehicles for convergence and gear up battery and motor manufacturing
3970015 its like adding a second smaller electric fuel tank to the car
3970016 the problem we are looking at is this installed base
3970017 the problem i am finding is that battery technology is still not there
3970018 it depends on how deep are the pockets of the customer
3970019 you can do the full conversion and get 100 miles on the charge
3970020 if we had a mixed environment thats a good thing
3970021 this city used to be known for the sugar plant that operated here many years ago
3970022 today people know us as the home of the lopez family
3970023 thanks to them everyone will know where sugar land is after the olympics because they will no doubt come back winners
3970024 they would come home from school and after finishing their homework the oldest brother jean would start to train them back then it was nothing more than a sport and self defense but it wasnt long before they started to take it seriously and compete
3970025 i used to love watching martial arts competitions and i shared my admiration for the different disciplines with my children but what they have accomplished in this sport is completely their own i really had very little to do with it
3970026 since we were little they have instilled the values that a lot of hispanic families have that the most important thing is that the family comes first before anything i think that this family unity has been the great secret of our success
3970027 in our community we dont have enough models for our young people for example one of the moments that really influenced my life was when i saw oscar de la hoya win the gold medal in barcelona
3970028 watching an athlete with my skin color kissing a gold medal was really important to me because i could identify with him at that moment i remember that i cried with pride and i realized that you can achieve your dreams if you put your mind to it
3970029 im going for my third gold medal but the most important thing is that this time i am going with my two siblings who have the same goal i think that together we can leave a long lasting mark on the olympics because we have worked very hard to return with the three gold medals
3970030 i grew up with competition since i was girl i lived with the pressure to win because that was the example that my brothers set for me and they didnt treat me any differently because i was female i always demanded equality and that has made me really tough and able to handle the pressures that come with competing at a high level
3970031 i think the three of them understand what is expected of them in these games so they are pushing each other to give each training everything theyve got i have never seen so much determination and dedication
3970032 we are helping the community lift itself up and continue moving up
3970033 the community is growing and developing and we must help to ensure its continued growth
3970034 not everybody takes part in the hot lunches provided at the schools
3970035 they used to compliment the meals that i brought to school growing up
3970036 i was up at 5 o clock in the morning for orders relating to sinfully delicious
3970037 it is so much harder than a 9 to 5 job
3970038 our main goal is to help students with learning difficulties improve academically
3970039 were here to support them offer guidance and teach them the life long skills they need to realize their potential
3970040 many of our students are gifted but are shy and lack confidence and cant get the help they need
3970041 our eight week social skills program for mainly younger students teaches them how to listen develop friendships and about conflict resolution its very interactive they learn through play art and drama
3970042 they learn time management and organizational skills and how to do things their own way they also learn basic but important tips like how to take a test without getting nervous
3970043 the purpose of our workshops for parents is to provide strategies and coping mechanisms to show them how to stick up for their kids weve had guest speakers talk about everything from discipline to nutrition to where to find resources to help their child
3970044 you throw them into the environment you tell them to learn but you dont give them the tools to learn
3970045 some kinds are dressed to the nines and others dont have a backpack
3970046 a simple backpack filled with school supplies can make the difference to a child who can begin the year with an equal opportunity to succeed
3970047 for our donating service we receive about 1 000 computers a year but not everything can be repaired
3970048 we also recycle what we cannot use about 25 tonnes a year
3970049 we will show seniors how to use a mouse so they will understand how its an extension of their hand on the screen
3970050 we also show them to use websites since each one is different its really basic stuff
3970051 today it is almost held every year and this is the third time roman catholic officials like butuan bishop juan de dios pueblos and fr lito clase are calling the shots for the dumalondong which is not part of their duties after all since sacred tribal rites like dumalondong must be initiated by pure higaonons like us
3970052 you may have a pain in a muscle or in a joint and that is something to keep an eye on but when you start seeing swelling then that is when you need to get a doctor to look at it
3970053 most of the time you know what a true injury is
3970054 this is due to kids that are starting at a very young age in year round sports specific activities such as softball basketball or baseball
3970055 if you do just one sport continuously over an extended period of time as your body matures you will end up with a sports injury that will cause long term injury
3970056 last week i read an article about a family in california that have their daughter starting to pitch at the age of 4
3970057 shes not even eligible to play in the leagues until she is 8 do that for four years and you are going to wear something out really fast
3970058 i would love in my line of work to be the maytag repairman and never have to lift my finger
3970059 in reality we know that is not the way it is going to be these kids play hard and theres always a chance that someone will get injured were here to help prevent and treat injuries if and when they happen
3970060 how on earth am i realistically going to find a cute one shouder dress that flatters my shape
3970061 secured transactions covered by the new law are loans backed by movable assets such as boats cars or farm equipment to help people secure a loan to help start or grow a business
3970062 as a general rule borrowers can expect better loan terms such as larger amounts longer tenor and lower interest rates if their loans are backed by collaterals
3970063 if we need it this is the only day we can ask for it and results in our district are a little mixed there have been times we have been successful in general elections
3970064 at some point in the future we will need to deal with that
3970065 for the last 10 years plus the school district has been growing pretty rapidly in our district you need buildings were not asking for anything right now but will have to in the near future
3970066 duceti va si faceti ucenici din toate neamurile botezandu i in numele tatalui si al fiului si al sfantului duh si invatati i sa pazeasca tot ce v am poruncit si iata ca eu sunt cu voi in toate zilele pana la sfarsitul veacului
3970067 duceti va in toata lumea si propovaduiti evanghelia la orice faptura cine va crede si se va boteza va fi mantuit dar cine nu va crede va fi osandit
3970068 asa este scris si asa trebuia sa patimeasca cristos si sa invieze a treia zi dintre cei morti si sa se propovaduiasca tuturor neamurilor in numele lui pocainta si iertarea pacatelor incepand din ierusalim voi sunteti martori ai acestor lucruri si iata ca voi trimite peste voi fagaduinta tatalui meu dar ramaneti in cetate pana veti fi imbracati cu putere de sus
3970069 ci voi veti primi o putere cand se va pogori duhul sfant peste voi si mi veti fi martori in ierusalim in toata iudeea in samaria si pana la marginile pamantului
3970070 pentru ca zici sunt bogat m am imbogatit si nu duc lipsa de nimic si nu stii ca esti ticalos nenorocit sarac orb si gol te sfatuiesc sa cumperi de la mine aur curatit prin foc ca sa te imbogatesti si haine albe ca sa te imbraci cu ele si sa nu ti se vada rusinea goliciunii tale si doctorie pentru ochi ca sa ti ungi ochii si sa vezi eu mustru si pedepsesc pe toti aceia pe care i iubesc fii plin de ravna dar si pocaieste te
3970071 bucurati va cat mai puteti pentru ca in 10 ani si voi veti fi ca noi
3970072 pe vremuri ortodocsii aveau un altar in partea de rasarit a casei iar pocaitii aveau biblia pusa la loc de cinste deschisa pe masa acum si unii si altii au televizorul
3970073 sunteti bogati v ati imbogatit dar duhul a plecat de la voi
3970074 dulu saya berangkat ke kampus dari rumah di rumpin bogor
3970075 awalnya minder pas pertama kali mau terjun buat mulung shock gitu lah seiring dengan perjalanan waktu akhirnya ada kesadaran bahwa islam tidak mengajarkan kita untuk minder dan menangisi nasib kita harus sabar dan tawadhu dijalani dengan senang hati semangat semuanya dilakukan dengan niat karena allah
3970076 pernah ketemu teman satu sekolah pas lagi mulung tadinya saya mau menyapa duluan tapi dia langsung kabur mungkin shock melihat temannya dalam kondisi ini mungkin dia belum pernah ketemu sama temen yang dalam keadaan memulung
3970077 sering dapat kebijakan dari sekolah karena saya bilang kalau saya dapat uang itu ya terbatas paling 3 bulan sekali karena dapat uang itu dari memulung
3970078 dulu makan juga cuma sekali di rumah aja tapi porsinya jadi dobel
3970079 alhamdulillah nggak sempet drop semangat karena pendapat pendapat yang ngga enak karena kan kalau yang namanya komentar negatif begitu lebih baik tidak dipedulikan kan yang memberi rizki itu allah bukan mereka
3970080 men who are unhappy like men who sleep badly are always proud of the fact
3970081 if you peel back the skin of this world what will you find you will find the kingdom of god a kingdom where the meek inherit the earth and mountains are moved with words
3970082 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him
3970083 so what does the newest campaign for liberty t shirt look like
3970084 mama jangan meninggal nanti aku ga punya mama aku gamau mama yang lain
3970085 early case identification and treatment with oseltamivir is key to addressing the high case fatality rate in indonesian cases there is a clear need to identify definite causes for high case fatality
3970086 consideration needs to be given now not in the teeth of a pandemic and not deflected by either proprietary defensiveness or opportunistic profiteering to gauging the comprehensiveness of national surveillance for human h5n1 cases
3970087 the dispute is politically motivated bob crow wants tube lines trashed
3970088 we cant be held to ransom by a militant union tube lines and their workforce need to stand firm in resisting strike action
3970089 the start of the beijing olympics has done little to fuel peoples enthusiasm for 2012
3970090 people feel that the budget is spiralling out of control and they feel money could be better spent elsewhere
3970091 londoners and indeed the british public as a whole will never forget the tragic events of july 7th 2005 gill hicks embodies the bravery and spirit of those who were most severely affected
3970092 i am pleased to be able to show my support for gill and the walktalk initiative and to join all those involved who wish to make our society one that embraces peaceful discussion community safety and tolerance
3970093 the primary intention of north yorkshire police throughout this difficult intention was to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved i am satisfied with the way we achieved our objective
3970094 north yorkshire police would like to thank local residents for their patience and support
3970095 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the us europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3970096 rally the free world in support of a free georgia
3970097 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
3970098 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
3970099 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
3970100 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3970101 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3970102 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3970103 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3970104 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3970105 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan
3970106 this report is rubbish from start to finish it certainly wont become conservative policy
3970107 conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the regeneration resurgence of cities right across england including in the north of england
3970108 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3970109 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3970110 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3970111 i think the idea that cities cannot regenerate themselves is just nonsense and i think that people should see this report in that way
3970112 it is difficult to find anything sensible in this report
3970113 mass migration from north to south is the last thing struggling areas need it would widen rather than narrow the gap between north and south
3970114 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3970115 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities
3970116 theres a huge amount of research now showing people have a preference for attractive people from birth to death
3970117 babies prefer attractive faces and adults treat attractive babies better
3970118 our happiness levels seem to be pre set in life
3970119 and basically the mayor and economic development corporation are trying to rape and rob our land from us
3970120 we cant have a situation where one building owner sits there and sticks it to the whole city
3970121 im okay about it but i think i am not tall enough
3970122 asked how she felt about her brother nicholass performance in the olympics opening ceremony not being shown on tv she says she is a little dissapointed but watched his performance later on youtube
3970123 we only informed people about the event yesterday and a lot of them have to work
3970124 we now know who your friends are when you are in trouble but we wont let sukie retire yet as she is still young
3970125 the best thing is being able to go off the dole no one has wanted to take me on
3970126 im feeling at peace for the first time since my arrest 15 years ago and am slowly realising i have a future after all
3970127 i thought the establishment would make a token payment but this is like winning the lottery
3970128 the worst case scenario is that russia decides not to adhere to the peace plan which is still in very outlined form russia may even go as far as to surround or shell tbilisi itself
3970129 that really would be a major international incident it would be extremely counterproductive for russia
3970130 all the eu can commonly agree on is an absence of conflict essentially its role is one of conflict mediator
3970131 its unlikely to accelerate it its a prima facie case a small state on europes periphery being threatened by a larger case however institutionally nato is not really ready for expanding further
3970132 he was our only brother and he kept in contact with us no matter what he was going through
3970133 but now that hes gone we wont even be able to share those simple conversations
3970134 at the end of the day you have to evaluate your own situation
3970135 does it help us first and foremost the evaluation was that it did
3970136 i think playing with lebron hes someone who can help push the tempo a little bit and help lebron and other guys get easier baskets
3970137 i like him i think hes a competitive player who can make big shots and one of those guys capable of rising to important times
3970138 if we were going to use an expiring deal we were going to have to take on payroll at some level
3970139 this again shows ownerships commitment to winning a championship here in cleveland and making the investment necessary along the way especially with a young player like mo we also still have some flexibility within the organization the way our contracts are set up going forward
3970140 use the address 2001 cc1e x 3 y 64 for r3s ethernet interface
3970141 configure r2 so that ripng routes learned from bb2 with a mask longer than 64 will not be passed on to r3
3970142 r6 should see only one router for both the frame relay segment and vlan 17 of r1
3970143 in a goal line situation obrien schofield got a little rolled up
3970144 we were nervous at the beginning thought it was a little more severe
3970145 he understands when he is supposed to leverage things he has taken advantage of the reps that he has gotten since matt left
3970146 we might sit him part of next week as well
3970147 were really trying to back off him let him settle down and see where he is at monday
3970148 kendall always sports a big gob of something that im guessing is not seeds in his mouth when hes up to bat
3970149 except you made it sound like i actually keep the doritos
3970150 hey if you live in your parents basement at least you put doritos in your pants and watch brewers and blog
3970151 however high pitch screaming no not that one you pervs is too much for anyone
3970152 i get to watch the game on my computer while theyre doing it im supposed to be watching for cheaters
3970153 we need to hold several brewers bloggers bake sale and have all the proceeds go to mark a
3970154 if i had a dollar for everytime bill schroeder said
3970155 someone tell me how we got the last 4 runs
3970156 actually i think you said you dont drink robertearle so whatever else you want
3970157 why should i be blamed because i slept with a man i loved and had a child while many other women sleep with their husband without love
3970158 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3970159 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3970160 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3970161 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3970162 gampang tinggal salin file instalasi windows xp ke flash disk
3970163 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
3970164 i think asthma has really helped me in my athletic career
3970165 i dont think i would have run track to the fullest of my potential if i had not had asthma
3970166 i feel really blessed to be in this position its an honor a privilege and im just enjoying the moment
3970167 im good i work out in the morning time every day and havent had problems
3970168 i just really hope that people dont sit on the sidelines engage in life life is worth living to the fullest from the soccer mom who thinks she cant be out there watching her kids play soccer because of the pollen to kids who have asthma
3970169 i tell them were going to have to work this out
3970170 it would be more of a layout and production thing
3970171 one person with passion is better than forty people merely interested
3970172 the desire for happiness is not in myself alone or in a few friends but is found in everybody if we did not know this with certain knowledge we would not want it with determination in our will but what does this mean
3970173 im sipping a scummy pint of cloudy beer in the back of a trendy dive bar turned nightclub in the heart of the citys heroin district
3970174 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
3970175 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
3970176 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
3970177 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
3970178 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
3970179 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
3970180 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
3970181 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
3970182 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
3970183 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
3970184 what do you want me to do today if theres a conversation you want to have tell me i want to follow you but i need you to make yourself be known
3970185 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
3970186 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
3970187 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
3970188 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their weetabix box
3970189 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
3970190 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
3970191 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
3970192 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
3970193 when i didnt serve out at 5 3 and i hit three double faults that kind of drove me crazy
3970194 but i regained my composure and once i broke him in the second set i knew i could win
3970195 i was cramping at 5 6 and the trainer told me he could not see me until the end of the set so i had to carry on
3970196 although he has been at short odds to win he has being doing the right thing by the punters who are getting back more than they get on bank interest
3970197 he really has become a thorn in the bookmakers side
3970198 but phelps is such a phenomenon we have seen interest in him
3970199 the price of oil people being under insured so we have to pass those costs on to everyone else blah blah blah
3970200 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
3970201 we all know too well from our experience in the past three decades about the public conflict and social costs involved in building a nuclear power plant and a nuclear waste dumpsite
3970202 no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord it will be shown who the lord really is on this site v 29 none devoted shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to death
3970203 thou shalt not delay to offer the first or thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors
3970204 the people shouted the priests blew their trumpets the wall fell down flat v 21 they
3970205 whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house jephthahs house to meet me shall surely
3970206 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good
3970207 oh yes the other fellows religion is hypnotic enslavement but mine is the true religion
3970208 the other fellow believes in the triune god but i only believe in jesus
3970209 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
3970210 if youre going to bomb a georgia city bomb some worthless place like macon or columbus no forget that last one thats the capital of ohio maybe brunswick or valdosta
3970211 atlanta is the capital of georgia and its economic hub its destruction would wreak havoc on the southeast usa
3970212 my god it makes ohare look like a church parking lot on a monday morning if you bomb it thatll make the problem more worser than it is
3970213 georgia is surrounded by unfriendly places and you cant blame president perdue for taking action
3970214 i looked into his eyes and saw his soul and it sure looked like gen shermans
3970215 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
3970216 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
3970217 obama holds a sizable lead among younger residents non whites college graduates women and residents of philadelphia
3970218 mccain has an advantage with protestants fundamentalist christians and residents of northeastern and northwestern pennsylvania
3970219 im sorry i think you have the wrong carrie i dont know anything about picking anyone up
3970220 theyve lawmakers had a lot on their plate this is not one of these big issues that you read about but maybe we can get it through on the merits
3970221 that is a really happy man i want to be where he is
3970222 if you like women then why would you get a sex change
3970223 existence without essence 1 there can be no predetermined human nature since there is no god in which to conceive it
3970224 man is what he wills himself to be after this thrust toward existence
3970225 the deepest sense of existence is to be found in this suffering only art enables us to face this suffering rather than to run from it
3970226 when an existentialist looks inside himself what does he find
3970227 we have a language that reflects how we learn to paint but not on how we learn to paint our paintings
3970228 core expression is needed to create good art but is not the only step towards this goal if this core expression of the human condition is altered poorly through the medium or tainted by the combination of a poor and un thought out ideas the piece will be lost
3970229 in music there is nothing outside of the melody itself unlike ideas which can be adequately rendered in several ways
3970230 it is not length of life but depth of life
3970231 hello and welcome to brian robinson studios comic book catalog

3970237 my attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed it is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts the idea of an evolution rests on pure belief
3970238 scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con men and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever in explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact
3970239 250 000 species of plants and animals recorded and deposited in museums throughout the world did not support the gradual unfolding hoped for by darwin
3970240 the pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution which no science can do
3970241 the miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation
3970242 scientists at the forefront of inquiry have put the knife to classical darwinism they have not gone public with this news but have kept it in their technical papers and inner counsels
3970243 in the meantime the educated public continues to believe that darwin has provided all the relevant answers by the magic formula of random mutations plus natural selection quite unaware of the fact that random mutations turned out to be irrelevant and natural selection tautology
3970244 a growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp
3970245 it must be significant that nearly all the evolutionary stories i learned as a student have now been debunked
3970246 one must conclude that contrary to the established and current wisdom a scenario describing the genesis of life on earth by chance and natural causes which can be accepted on the basis of fact and not faith has not been written
3970247 darwins evolutionary explanation of the origins of man has been transformed into a modern myth to the detriment of scientific and social progress the secular myths of evolution have had a damaging effect on scientific research leading to distortion to needless controversy and to gross misuse of science i mean the stories the narratives about change over time how the dinosaurs became extinct how the mammals evolved where man came from these seem to me to be little more than story telling
3970248 the probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the probability of the unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in a printing shop
3970249 one has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible yet here we are as a result i believe of spontaneous generation
3970250 the explanation value of the evolutionary hypothesis of common origin is nil evolution not only conveys no knowledge it seems to convey anti knowledge how could i work on evolution ten years and learn nothing from it most of you in this room will have to admit that in the last ten years we have seen the basis of evolution go from fact to faith it does seem that the level of knowledge about evolution is remarkably shallow we know it ought not be taught in high school and thats all we know about it
3970251 hypothesis evolution based on no evidence and irreconcilable with the facts these classical evolutionary theories are a gross over simplification of an immensely complex and intricate mass of facts and it amazes me that they are swallowed so uncritically and readily and for such a long time by so many scientists without a murmur of protest
3970252 there is the theory that all the living forms in the world have arisen from a single source which itself came from an inorganic form
3970253 all of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere we all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet it is just that lifes complexity is so great it is hard for us to imagine that it did
3970254 the deceit is sometimes unconscious but not always since some people owing to their sectarianism purposely overlook reality and refuse to acknowledge the inadequacies and the falsity of their beliefs
3970255 meanwhile their evolutionists unproven theories will continue to be accepted by the learned and the illiterate alike as absolute truth and will be defended with a frantic intolerance that has a parallel only in the bigotry of the darkest middle ages if one does not accept evolution as an infallible dogma implicitly and without question one is regarded as an unenlightened ignoramus or is merely ignored as an obscurantist or a naive uncritical fundamentalist
3970256 it is my conviction that if any professional biologist will take adequate time to examine carefully the assumptions upon which the macro evolution doctrine rests and the observational and laboratory evidence that bears on the problem of origins he she will conclude that there are substantial reasons for doubting the truth of this doctrine moreover i believe that a scientifically sound creationist view of origins is not only possible but it is to be preferred over the evolutionary one
3970257 for myself as no doubt for most of my contemporaries the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation the liberation we desired was simultaneously liberation from a certain political and economic system and liberation from a certain system of morality we objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom
3970258 i suppose the reason we leaped at the origin of species was because the idea of god interfered with our sexual mores
3970259 evolution is unproved and improvable we believe it because the only alternative is special creation which is unthinkable
3970260 perhaps generations of students of human evolution including myself have been flailing about in the dark that our data base is too sparse too slippery for it to be able to mold our theories rather the theories are more statements about us and ideology than about the past paleontology reveals more about how humans view themselves than it does about how humans came about but that is heresy
3970261 if i knew of any evolutionary transitionals fossil or living i would certainly have included them in my book evolution
3970262 for over 20 years i thought i was working on evolution
3970263 can you tell me any one thing that is true
3970264 yes i do know one thing it ought not to be taught in high school
3970265 the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as a trade secret of paleontology evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches the rest is inference however reasonable not the evidence of fossils
3970266 within the period of human history we do not know of a single instance of the transformation of one species into another one it may be claimed that the theory of descent is lacking therefore in the most essential feature that it needs to place the theory on a scientific basis this must be admitted
3970267 the facts of paleontology seem to support creation and the flood rather than evolution
3970268 it remains true as every paleontologist knows that most new species genera and families and that nearly all categories above the level of families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known gradual completely continuous transitional sequences
3970269 darwinism is a creed not only with scientists committed to document the all purpose role of natural selection it is a creed with masses of people who have at best a vague notion of the mechanism of evolution as proposed by darwin let alone as further complicated by his successors clearly the appeal cannot be that of a scientific truth but of a philosophical belief which is not difficult to identify darwinism is a belief in the meaninglessness of existence

3970358 ill definately be there and ill bring some people with me
3970359 i think when youre watching the tape or really when youre out here in practice sometimes practice can go on and on and on and at times kind of feels like youre just running plays where all of a sudden somebody jumps out at you and does something different
3970360 then you start to feel him once and then he jumps out again and you feel him again then you go back to the film and you really watch this guy and you see that hes been playing pretty consistent thats happened to me in the last couple weeks really this week with a few guys theres a young kid out there right now that im starting to feel and its titus brown ive seen him kind of do some things in the last couple days that have piqued my interest that way
3970361 anytime the head coach singles you out good or bad its a good deal for you because that means hes really watching you and taking time out to sort through things with you and is giving you a great deal of respect
3970362 theres a little bit of pressure because if you did one play good then hes going to expect more plays to be good so you have to keep going 100 percent
3970363 there are some other guys that were wondering whether or not they can do more jobs right now we need to see that via the special teams
3970364 then theres a core of special teams guys that you know youre going to carry to the game at some point that need to play together we need to get them playing together as well all of those things are taking place this week
3970365 michael and i we werent close friends but i know him and ive approached him and talked to him a little bit

3970367 hes a humble person so he goes about his things the right way
3970368 we want to see michael out there the problem is you have to take this thing a little slow and be cautious of it right now and see how we get on in this thing here and how it heals
3970369 it looks like hes making great progress right now and i think were hopeful i really liked what i saw of him in the spring so im kind of anxious to get him back in this game you can never have enough corners theyre like tackles you got to have them and if you have them you should keep them michael did some good things in the spring so hes a guy that wed love to get a chance to evaluate and see
3970370 i have seen some improvement in fact the guy that ive seen improvement with in the last couple of days has been ernest wilford
3970371 i thought ernest has caught the ball the last couple of days and you start to feel him a little bit more and hes made a few plays that way i think the guys have made an effort to catch the ball a little bit better and theyve spent some time out here a little bit extra time that way but we got a long way to go we got to get it done in the games
3970372 i want them to finish blocks in this game you got to finish blocks i dont really like touchy feely
3970373 i like people that run across the ball and get on the other side of the football and can make some noise that way ive tried to make them understand that thats where we want to be theyre starting to get there i see it i do see improvement in that group i really do theyre starting to get it a little bit but you got to remind them thats my job if i see something wrong out here in any place on this team my job is to try to fix it and ill get in the middle of it to do that

3970388 i am deeply concerned about what would happen if the maoists come to power
3970389 even if we were not given the reins of the government we should have been given the defence ministry
3970390 we are ready to carry out whatever orders you issue our three security organs are with you because of the maoists militant past whatever you do you cant have good relations with them
3970391 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3970393 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3970394 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3970395 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3970396 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3970398 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3970399 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3970400 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3970401 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3970402 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3970403 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3970404 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3970579 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar

3970604 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3970605 where is the balance here where is the fairness he said

3970607 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did mr barr said
3970608 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3970609 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it

3970647 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
3970648 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
3970649 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
3970650 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words
3970651 can that behaviour be untrained if they could express things more completely in a full sentence or in a question thats to be determined google just has so much market share right now
3970652 id love to get another couple of hours with him just to let him ramble just to let him talk
3970653 i felt he should have settled and not gone to trial in the first place
3970654 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
3970655 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3970656 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3970657 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3970658 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3970659 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3970660 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3970661 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3970662 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3970663 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3970664 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3970665 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3970666 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3970667 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3970668 the thing that stands out for his entire tenure is that he has never had a priority and has never had to my knowledge any accomplishment of any kind at all
3970669 the prevention lies not in censoring what goes into the internet
3970670 but rather in filtering what comes out of it onto the computers our children use outside the home
3970671 we took a major step forward when we decided to wire every school and library in america to the internet thats a good program
3970672 part of the concern was that there had been frankly too little debate about the act before the public and that the broadcasters were getting extraordinary benefits without sufficient return to the public for what they were doing
3970673 unless there is a clear cut unequivocal restraint of competition the government should stay out of it
3970674 by redrawing the ownership and competition rules that govern the industry it has created incentives both intended and unintended for companies to merge
3970675 mccain was encouraging the notion of competition but really did very little to limit consolidation
3970676 well im not going to attempt to do that i think its a cheeky argument
3970677 mccain sees the internet mainly as a business and trusts market forces to foster innovation for societys benefit
3970678 when you control the pipe you should be able to get profit from your investment
3970679 never done any favors for anybody lobbyist or special interest group thats a clear 24 year record
3970680 c lear leader in fund raising from high tech companies
3970681 but it ought to establish a rule of law where entrepreneurs can raise money and enter these markets
3970682 still running tests blah blah may have to send to japan blah blah unable to provide you with a temporary unit blah blah
3970683 i am proud to continue to dress these sporting icons
3970684 this new season brings with it the excitement of exceptional new players and of course a dynamic new manager i wish scolari and his new team every success
3970685 if ben says you have a good blog ill have to check it out
3970686 if the data older than 1 hour than fetch again
3970687 maybe if you do our work for us well consider it
3970688 yeah that would be nice but theres no way we have time for it right now if you submit something we might have the time to code review it and put it in
3970689 i dont have time to implement this wrapping urllib2 around urlfetch is trickier than you might think however if someone does our work for us we might add it
3970690 if urllib compatibility is required for your existing app and you dont want to port it thats not our problem but well help if we can
3970691 the python that we use in app engine is the same python that youve grown to know and love
3970692 app engine isnt managed python hosting its a new development framework that happens to use a large subset of the python language
3970693 google app engine supports any framework written in pure python that speaks cgi and any wsgi compliant framework using a cgi adaptor including django cherrypy pylons and web py
3970694 im open to suggestions for specific changes that will make pylons etc work e g if as ian suggests a stub version of subprocess py will help please produce one and ill review it and if it passes muster i will try to get it added ditto for missing os functions
3970695 if googles customers want the product to work as advertised theyll have to fix it themselves on their own time
3970696 i found out that not tying myself down to watch everyday at 2 pm has really opened up my schedule
3970697 i just read that bangs are now back in style
3970698 you really need to tell me how you feel more often
3970699 so how does a newbie end up picking such a lousy group of ides to try
3970700 so is there any decent ide that incorporates a gui builder free open source or not i dont care i am looking to learn a new language but i am frustrated by the lack of ecosystem and decent ides for python et al
3970701 we can have something that works for simple cases but any time you need anything remotely complex youre gonna want to drop down to html anyway so why bother
3970702 all ive written a lot of regular expressions and while i like to think im pretty good at doing so theyve always stayed slightly
3970703 nobody will want to acquire a product built on app engine because youre locked in
3970704 yes but they may take some getting used to for years the propellant in inhalers was chlorofluorocarbon the cfc helped push the active drug such as albuterol out of the canister and into the airways making breathing easier for people with asthma but cfcs damage the earths ozone layer and have therefore been eliminated from many products now that good alternative inhalers are available the us food and drug administration has ruled that cfc inhalers may not be sold after dec 31 the cfc free inhalers use a different propellant called hfas or hydrofluoroalkanes which do not damage the ozone layer but the new inhalers taste and feel different
3970705 anyone paying the slightest attention to the digital world knows of the huge success of social networking sites with facebook and myspace in the starring roles there are now sites for lawyers marketers real estate agents stamp collectors those undergoing divorce and just about any category imaginable including doctors the biggest site for physicians sermo com not only is becoming a huge community 72 000 so far with a couple thousand more signing on every month it has the potential to bring profound change to american medicine
3970706 what is intentionally misnamed health care for political and economic reasons should be adequately called sick care this gigantic self feeding social cancer is bankrupting our nation and the global economy at a whopping 1 3 trillion dollars a year with over 90 percent of the money spent in the last 30 days of human life real health care is diametrically opposed in method and process to toxic pharmaceuticals and risky surgical procedures thats sick care which has nothing to do with health we need to closely examine the misdirection of this illusionary pseudoscience called healthcare that bases their scientific research on false premises of the germ theory of disease
3970707 yes i have put a little thought into cross site scripting attacks
3970708 when owen beck was 17 doctors amputated his right leg to stop the spread of bone cancer his parents desperate to find a drug that would relieve their sons excruciating phantom limb pain brought him to charlie lynchs medical marijuana dispensary in morro bay california carrying a recommendation from a stanford university oncologist the marijuana not only eased the pain but also alleviated the nausea caused by chemotherapy called to testify as a character witness in lynchs federal marijuana trial beck did not get far when he mentioned his cancer u s district judge george wu cut him off and sent him packing wu decreed there would be no talk of the symptoms marijuana relieves no references to californias recognition of marijuana as a medicine no mention even of the phrase medical marijuana in front of the jury
3970709 its supposed to try both dns servers but we can try setting the primary dns server to opendns as well
3970710 it makes sense to start with properties for classes in certain kinds of libraries
3970711 scala needs something like pythons enumerate function if you want to loop each object in a collection but you need its index too you have to do a manual for loop
3970712 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith he said
3970713 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3970714 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible mr lawrence said
3970715 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3970716 where is the balance here where is the fairness he said
3970717 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3970718 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did mr barr said
3970719 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3970720 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
3970721 the resource and energy sectors are the locomotives of the market today with bhp rio and woodside all up over four per cent after not a bad night from commodity markets austock securities senior client advisor michael heffernan said
3970722 the reports that have been coming out by companies over this week have also been really good really impressive and that gives a bit of fortification to the overall markets performance
3970723 i think these numbers should provide a bit more assurance to policy makers that wages growth overall remain fairly well under control mr redican said
3970724 the annual growth over the last year at around 3 75 to 4 per cent shouldnt really provide any alarm to policy makers
3970725 the fact that they didnt suggests that it is a precautionary cut back in spending rather than a really forced cut back mr redican said
3970726 if you expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year then it will take a fair while before that reflected in lower wages growth
3970727 despite its volatility the rba will take some comfort that the growth in this measure has moderated and is now closer to the more reliable wage cost index data released yesterday
3970728 god i love eating you out ive been waiting to lower my face on this
3970729 i love feeling your tiny fingers on my thick cock
3970730 there are so many theres probably 60 swimmers i know of that are working in some capacity or swimming in capacity that are former tigers
3970731 its pretty unreal training with these guys then seeing them on the olympics on tv
3970732 its almost like youre there yourself you get so excited so pumped
3970733 even though we havent been to the olympics weve been to the ncaa championships and you know the environment and excitement thats in the air
3970734 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
3970735 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3970736 even though the rate cut is priced in theres speculation on whether its 25 or 50 basis points he said
3970737 the comments by the reserve bank just reinforced the widely held opinion of the rate cut
3970738 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar
3970739 if theres any sort of positive rebound for the aussie it most likely would be an upward movement in gold and oil mr waterer said adding the australian dollar could climb back to us0 8730 if commodity prices rose
3970740 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
3970741 it now comes time for us to be able to present our side of the story
3970742 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena
3970743 is it an explosive situation that can create a backlash sure but thats not what i see
3970744 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too
3970745 not only are we going to have a relatively small workforce but also one thats more diverse
3970746 we need to become very concerned about getting the proper education track for those in the pipeline
3970747 the challenge for policymakers is to make sure that especially for children they have all the opportunities and resources they need to become productive adults
3970748 more and more of the hispanic population is going to be native in the future
3970749 these are people who have grown up here gone to american schools and grown up speaking english
3970750 employers need to be mindful and aware of these changes and implement workplace policies that are non discriminatory
3970751 employees do not leave their biases at the door when they enter a workplace
3970752 if there is racial strife or racial or ethnic tension that may translate into the workplace
3970753 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her
3970754 she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
3970755 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3970756 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3970757 the legislators of mauritania support the change that occurred in the interest of the mauritanian people
3970758 we regret that all of the attempts made by members of parliament and other well intentioned people failed to lessen the stubbornness of the former president who did not listen to his constituents
3970759 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3970760 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
3970761 they want to attend to their farms and return to their normal life but land mines and unexploded munitions are posing a danger to civilians
3970762 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
3970763 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes
3970764 had militias not attacked the milf there would have been no hostilities in north cotabato
3970765 2003 is considered the 21st century quick history lesson thats when we invaded iraq just clarifying because you just looked really dumb
3970766 in the 21st century one nation does not invade another nation with the intent of overthrowing the ruling government
3970767 look what he did he smeared all over the place
3970768 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3970769 to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
3970770 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3970771 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3970772 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3970773 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3970774 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3970775 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3970776 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3970777 ohhh i have to show some love for our filipino athletes i have to be part of this hullaballoo because its a historical event and whatever
3970778 ik heb gecontroleerd gezwommen al moest ik er wel voor werken maar dit is wel prima
3970779 kijk van die chinese zijn we wel af maar ik had haar er misschien liever in dan trickett
3970780 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3970781 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3970782 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3970783 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3970784 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3970785 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3970786 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3970787 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3970788 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3970789 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features
3970790 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
3970791 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3970792 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time
3970793 and i think judgments will be made about how we handled this situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision about who should be commander in chief
3970794 but i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i think this is a very serious situation but i dont see this as a return to nuclear standoffs et cetera et cetera
3970795 discussions about an international peacekeeping operation including canvassing nations for possible contributions to such a force
3970796 im sorry to be repetitious this is no time for that this is no time for that the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
3970797 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3970798 yesterday i heard senator mccain say we are all georgians now
3970799 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3970800 devil went down to georgia and he was willing to make a deal
3970801 mccain wanted to make a distinction between himself and obama he did he overreacted was shooting from the hip and showed that he had an opinion before he had the facts this is what bush did in iraq mccain may even be more dangerous because he did not learn from iraq bush at least waited until the facts were available
3970802 having to chose between these two unqualified pro globalization back slappers is a disgrace at least hillary seemed like she had a brain between her ears
3970803 hemos venido trabajando de manera interinstitucional con el ministerio p blico la fiscal a nacional y ha delegado un fiscal p blico con competencia nacional para que investigue el caso especifico del hermano ind gena que falleci el 22 de julio as como las circunstancias que encierra este caso

3970806 britains broken im a stranger in my own country political correctness gone mad blah blah blah
3970807 many arab and islamic countries do rather fear the outrage of the public if they declare the true figures
3970808 all rivers flow to the sea and the sea is never full
3970809 es de vital importancia para todos nosotros realmente tomarnos el tiempo necesario para comprender la manera en que los estudiantes est n utilizando la ltima tecnolog a las diversas caracter sticas de estos nuevos servicios y apreciar c mo estas nuevas herramientas pueden ayudar a una buena interacci n social y el aprendizaje
3970810 i would like the premier and the health minister to just fix the hospitals
3970811 no one should have to put up with what my father has put up with this is not the first time this has happened here
3970812 i live just behind the hospital weve been here before and have been kept waiting for hours for treatment
3970813 this is just a stuff up they need to put more money and resources into the public health system
3970814 he has served his country in time of war yet when he needs urgent health care the government lets him down
3970815 it is unacceptable that an 86 year old man is forced to wait 20 hours on a trolley for a hospital bed
3970816 south australias hospitals are falling apart because the government has put its health dollars into a new hospital rather than extra doctors nurses and more procedures
3970817 patient care is suffering as a result of the governments wrong priorities

3970820 hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pertumbuhan ekonomi as tidak seburuk yang diperkirakan sebelumnya ini mendorong pelaku asing membeli dolar as yang diikuti pelaku lokal
3970821 kami memperkirakan rupiah masih berada di bawah posisi rp9 200 per dolar as pada penutupan sore nanti meski tekanan pasar cukup besar
3970822 eamon dan saya teman dekat dan saya mendukung dia dan dia mendukung saya
3970823 ketika teman teman di sekolah mendengar berita saya akan ke olimpiade mereka mengira itu suatu guyonan
3970824 hal yang menarik adalah mereka berdua sebaya mereka mahabintang hampir menjadi mitos budaya dari dekade 1980 sampai dasawarsa 1990 an namun dalam banyak hal mereka sulit diperbandingkan
3970825 orang bisa saja beralasan bahwa sebagai seorang musisi penari dan penghibur michael jackson memiliki segalanya ketimbang madonna
3970826 ia orang yang berada di puncak seperti frank sinatra bing crosby elvis presley salah satu dari penampil top musik dari sejarah budaya kita
3970827 madonna terus mempertahankan daya ciptanya dan tetap relevan saya kira dia tetap dalam pentas musik populer
3970828 saya tak tahu seperti apa dia pada usia 60 tahun tetapi mick jagger telah mampu melewatinya dan ia tetap bisa mengajak penggemar mengayunkan dan menggoyang badan mereka

3970833 lucharemos por lograr la victoria que es el mejor regalo que podemos hacerle en este nuevo aniversario
3970834 hay que vencer la distancia y el cambio de hora olvidarse del p blico y concentrarse en las competiciones
3970835 hace un par de d as me molest mucho porque desde que llegu me han controlado cuatro veces y me sacaron sangre mucha sangre
3970836 me est n sacando tanta sangre que voy a estar muy d bil para la primera eliminatoria de los 100 metros
3970837 el lo sabe de manera que es uno poco extra o que se queje
3970838 posiblemente est exagerando sobre los cuatro ex menes pero sin dudas es parte del programa y sabe que ser controlado m s a menudo
3970839 en todo caso es bueno que haya sido controlado varias veces es el favorito en los 100 metros de manera que por qu no
3970840 en los ltimos siete d as ha habido 32 controles
3970841 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible

3970843 normalerweise verdiene ich meine br tchen als schauspieler in krimis und thrillern
3970844 in jedem guten krimi geht es um leben und tod um gut und b se um t ter und opfer
3970845 der unterschied zu dem krimi den ich jetzt gerade hier drehe ist dass alles real ist
3970846 man kann am tier am besten zeigen was wir der natur antun und das projekt am ehesten bei einem sender unterbringen

3970850 just as the world cannot exist without wind so too can the world not exist without the jewish people
3970851 is this just how could his majesty take away my living without even informing me
3970852 this would mean that i am stealing another mans livelihood
3970853 you are the absolute ruler here i want you to lease me the wind for ten thousand gold coins instead
3970854 show me a good and gracious loser and ill show you a failure
3970855 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3970856 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3970857 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3970858 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3970859 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3970860 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3970861 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3970862 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3970863 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3970864 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3970865 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3970866 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3970867 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3970868 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3970869 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
3970870 only a loon would obsess and keep this tirade going for months
3970871 i hope next time i can give you a handjob in the sauna
3970872 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
3970873 no one really did anything wrong i just wish i could have gotten that pitch to vernon down a little more
3970874 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
3970875 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
3970876 i didnt throw enough strikes early but i started to relax about the fourth inning thats when i started making the pitches i wanted
3970877 you get a walk an aggravating bunt and then a double play grounder that takes a bad hop
3970878 kenny did very well tonight but weve been getting bad hops lately
3970879 he just has to work on getting first pitch strikes and getting ahead of hitters
3970880 i didnt want to go out there and see a bone sticking out of his leg
3970881 hell be reassessed in a couple days but if he cant pitch it will be a big loss for the team
3970882 i dont think we as county leaders should have to remind adults to take care of their children thats common sense but apparently we have too
3970883 when you pull the petals out it has an etching of some saint mary joseph or i have even seen one of the last supper
3970884 you cant cook those off theyre a man made chemical a very stable chemical
3970885 we dont want anyone eating the fish that comes out of the reservoir or canal
3970886 were shocking them were basically electrocuting the fish it stuns them long enough for us to catch them
3970887 right now we dont know where the problem is it could be in different areas
3970888 its having the time of anyones life to be in the service of christ
3970889 i never knew before that life was good for anything but what one could get out of it now i know that the real fun lies in seeing how much one can put into life for others
3970890 do not grow weary doing good do good to all
3970891 if she is that bad why did you marry her
3970892 so are you saying that she is like this because shes been married to you
3970893 in october obamas former pastor wright will publish a new book and hit the road to promote it an occasion that might well place the topic of obamas blackness along with his patriotism and his candor about what he heard in the pews in all those years at trinity church squarely at the center of the national debate how obama handles that moment may determine whether he becomes the next occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue
3970894 the only book were working on is the history of trinity united church of christ and i havent even started editing that
3970895 he said that he also got an e mail but was unable to respond since hes in e mail hell
3970896 i asked him if he was writing and he said nope
3970897 the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color
3970898 not an attack on jeremiah wright it is an attack on the black church
3970899 he goes to church about as much as you do
3970900 what did your pastor preach in the last week you dont know
3970901 the goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalisation to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy
3970902 what should someone do if they feel they have a malevolent spirit or negative energy influencing them or attached to them magenta pixie after consulting with the collective consciousness of nine about this brings forward recommendations for releasing negative or malevolent spirits entities energies from your sphere
3970903 what this means is that with the seven pilot plants the military likes to refer to them as demonstrations with those being built it gives us the real time engineering data that we need to finish the designs for a full scale production facility
3970904 in 18 months or so we will start manufacturing oil directly from waste and we will build up to about 500 000 barrels a day within two years in another six months well reach a million barrels a day
3970905 cows are like people that eat lots of beans theyre really really good at making natural gas
3970906 it dawned on me that that natural gas was methane
3970907 we should have all of the plants running within 60 days
3970908 this is a big step in our growth from the engineering that we develop with these plants we will be able to build our full scale production facilities and be in full production in the next 12 to 18 months
3970909 everyone now accepts the fact that we can make oil through bacterial action and now it is just a matter of time and money until we are turning out one million to two million barrels per day
3970910 it will feel very very good to be to the point where we finally turn off the spigot from overseas
3970911 1 heart 1 mind 1 life it doesnt matter how what my dreams are if i dont believe in them have faith
3970912 1 heart 1 mind 1 life i have no need to impress i know who i am but maybe you should take time to get to know me

3970923 it really is way past time for the counter revolution to begin the urgency of our predicament demands that we all get off our asses and down from our high horses and proceed to get it on while we still can
3970924 why are you playing so close to the right field foul line
3970925 you come from a long line of strong women draw on their strength when you doubt your own
3970926 you are unique and special and perfect just as you are dont try to be someone else
3970927 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3970928 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3970929 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3970930 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3970931 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3970932 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3970933 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3970934 ya este pueblo est cansado de que no se respeten las leyes cuando hay actividades pol ticas ya sea por las autoridades locales como la alcald a o por la polic a ya hay que parar esto
3970935 la polic a sabe que esto pasa hace muchos a os de los dos partidos aqu tenemos que salvar a todos por igual
3970936 no existe ninguna excepci n incluyendo cualquier actividad o caravana pol tica
3970937 hubo diferencias entre los l deres pol ticos y los polic as pero el sargento maldonado ten a rdenes espec ficas
3970938 habl con el sargento para que no interviniera con uno de los four tracks y el sargento le se al que ten a que intervenir
3970939 en los actos pol ticos hay gente que se agita y si la polic a interviene muy agresivamente se puede formar un mot n
3970940 si es as que pidan refuerzos pero esto hay que pararlo
3970941 les toca a los partidos poner orden en sus caravanas
3970942 y pasaron a cuchillo a todos cuantos habia en ella hombres mujeres ni os y viejos matando hasta los bueyes ovejas y asnos
3970943 el se or pues estuvo con josu y su nombrad a se divulg por toda la tierra
3970944 oh mal haya samaria por haber exasperado a su dios perezcan todos al filo de la espada sean estrellados contra las rocas sus ni os y abiertos los vientres de sus mujeres pre adas
3970945 la gota que colm el vaso fue el descubrimiento de quaoar un asteroide del cintur n de kuiper anillo formado por millones de cuerpos que orbitan en lo m s externo del sistema solar de mayor tama o que plut n
3970946 entonces la uni n astron mica internacional uai organiz el proceso de recalificaci n
3970947 cuando ellos hicieron el recuento vieron que buena parte de los que no participaron en la votaci n eran compatriotas y supuestamente favorables a sus tesis
3970948 por ello ahora lo est n cuestionando cuando en realidad los que votaron eran miembros de una comisi n especializada en nomenclatura planetaria
3970949 la mayor a de la gente relacionada con la astrono m a que no forma parte del movimiento patri tico de eeuu apoya la decisi n de la uai
3970950 dicha decisi n a ade est totalmente de acuerdo con la realidad de los astros recientemente descubiertos en el sistema solar
3970951 ninguna organizaci n ha tenido nunca la necesidad de definir un t rmino que ya es de uso com n por lo que no hay raz n alguna en esta ocasi n
3970952 si los astr nomos argument usamos adjetivos como gigante y enano para describir las distintas subclases de objetos como planetas estrellas y galaxias por qu plut n no sigue siendo un planeta enano del mismo modo que j piter es un planeta gigante
3970953 if the economy remains robust on long island this population will continue to expand
3970954 what it says is there are going to be more people who belong to minority groups looking for housing on long island and basically thats going to create pressure to desegregate predominantly white areas can ethnic minority groups translate their greater numbers into greater political and legal power to challenge systemic discrimination in housing
3970955 what long islanders have to realize is that change is coming rather than being resistant to it we have to make it work as smoothly as possible so the economy and the social fabric benefits
3970956 one of the most important technological advancements in content distribution of the past 10 years

3970958 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3970959 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3970960 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3970964 where to begin the mining for the best economic return for shareholders
3970965 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3970966 with this senseless act of violence we have lost a good friend and honourable man
3970967 bill will be remembered for his hard work and dedication to the party and he will be sorely missed
3970968 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3970969 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3970970 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3970971 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3970972 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3970973 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3970974 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3970975 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3970976 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3970977 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3970978 the company is also making welcome progress with the introduction of a service in spain and is aiming to accelerate expansions plans into other markets
3970979 business remains robust with mobile calls now representing 65 per cent of total call volume
3970980 the company continues its transition to a services provider to the mobile community
3970981 the balance sheet remains largely ungeared allowing for funding of geographic expansion
3970982 cash reserves will be used to fund further expansion into overseas markets and to pay the final dividend for the 2008 financial year
3970983 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3970984 frankly speaking once again i was surprised by the skills of the speech writers who prepared the statement of the u s president
3970985 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3970986 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game
3970987 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3970988 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3970989 the figure will intensify the markets worry about an economic slowdown
3970990 things will improve a little after the olympic games as western countries place orders to prepare for christmas
3970991 we expect industrial production growth to be under continued pressures from these impacts especially in the next two months
3970992 there is a little more caution both around the world and in china compared with a few months ago the japanese economy seems to be slipping into recession and europe is spluttering so in that environment you can see how china would feel the fallout
3970993 but i think theres enough home grown momentum so that china on balance will be a welcome source of demand for the world economy

3970995 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3970996 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3970997 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3970998 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3970999 it covers what eye accessing cues are and addresses the objections raised by early researchers who were unable to match eye accessing cues to sense based vocabulary
3971000 2 things wrong with this video 1st you cant hear anything so there is no real way of knowing what he is responding to 2nd he is nlp trained an thus preprogrammed to respond according to the eye accessing cue model so he is a biased subject it seems to be an example of seeing what you want to see

3971003 there is a great deal of confusion about what they can do
3971004 some lobbying firms have decided not to go to either of the conventions
3971005 while we have been active at political conventions in the past we dont have any plans at this point for the upcoming convention
3971006 if you are having a reception it has to be light appetizers no forks just toothpicks
3971007 i think this is preposterous frankly because i dont think it is the genesis of the problem the people who brought us this whole regulatory regime intend to interrupt the normal social interaction between and among those who do business together
3971008 it might sound a little ridiculous but the intent was to stop the one on one sit down dinners between a lobbyist and lawmakers which was the trade of currency of jack abramoff who is now in prison for bribing members of congress
3971009 in general under minnesota law legislators and constitutional officers cannot take gifts from registered lobbyists
3971010 we have been working with our legal counsel at faegre amp benson
3971011 the really bigger issue is not so much whether or not a congressman is going to stuff his face with shrimp on a toothpick
3971012 an incredibly good opportunity for lobbyists and special interests to really mingle with members of congress and have serious face time with them
3971013 when we find out we will have the clients legal counsel review it to make sure everything passes muster
3971014 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3971015 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3971016 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3971017 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3971018 its nice to know that people are willing to help those who need help in this way especially now when times are tough
3971019 as a decorator i have always believed in the power of ones living space to transform ones life i love working at furniture sharehouse because i can make a difference in a familys life every time i volunteer
3971020 unlike other organizations that accept used furniture we give the furniture free of charge directly to those who need it the most instead of selling it at prices our clients could never afford
3971021 we are especially in need of kitchen tables and very good condition used mattresses and box springs no stains please we never have enough of these items
3971022 its not all about bottles and cans anymore although of course we do that too its about making people think about taking the next step to do the right thing and making it as easy as possible
3971023 the intent here is not only to protect teens from serious health complications even death that can result from abusing this product but to send out a bulletin to the entire community about the importance of being vigilant about having dxm cough syrup around the house
3971024 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3971028 aku tidak pernah melihat rasulullah berpuasa sebulan penuh kecuali ramadhan dan aku tidak melihat beliau lebih banyak berpuasa dibandingkan dengan bulan syaban
3971029 bulan yang paling rasulullah sukai untuk berpuasa di dalamnya adalah syaban kemudian beliau menyambungnya dengan puasa ramadhan
3971030 jika engkau telah selesai menunaikan puasa ramadhan maka berpuasalah dua hari sebagai gantinya
3971031 puasa manakah yang paling afdhal setelah puasa ramadhan rasul menjawab puasa syaban untuk mengagungkan ramadhan
3971032 wahai manusia kalian telah dinaungi bulan yang agung bulan penuh berkah bulan yang di dalamnya terdapat satu malam yang lebih baik dari seribu bulan allah telah menjadikan puasa pada bulan itu sebagi suatu kewajiban dan shalat malamnya sebagai sunnah siapa saja yang bertaqorrub di dalamnya denga suatu kebajikan ia seperti melaksanakan kewajiban pada bulan yang lain dan siapa saja yang melaksanakan di dalamnya ia seperti melaksanakan 70 kewajiban pada bulan yang lainnya bulan ramadhan adalah bulan sabar dan sabar pahalanya surga ia juga bulan pelipur lara dan ditambahnya rezeki seorang mukmin siapa saja yang memberi makan orang yang berbuka kepada orang yang berpuasa ia akan diampuni dosa dosanya dan dibebaskan lehernya dari api neraka ia akan mendapatkan pahala orang itu tanpa mengurangi pahalanya sedikit pun
3971033 kami tidak memiliki sesuatu untuk memberi makan orang yang berpuasa
3971034 allah akan memberikan pahala kepada orang yang memberi makan orang yang berbuka puasa meski dia hanya memberi sebutir kurma seteguk air minum atu setelapak susu ramadhan adalah bulan yang bulan yang awalnya rahmah pertengahanya adalah maghfirah dan akhirnya adalah pembebasan dari api neraka siapa saja yang meringankan hamba sahaynya allah akan mengampuninya dan membebaskannya dari api neraka perbanyaklah pada bulan ramadhan empat perkara dua perkara yang tuhan ridhai adalah kesaksian laa ilaaha illa allah muhammmad rasuulullaah dan permohonan ampunan kalian kepada nya adapun dua perkara yang kau butuhkan adalah kalian meminta kepada alllah surga dan berlindung kepada nya dari api neraka

3971040 the legal framework for allocating press rights and privileges is not keeping up with the pace of change
3971041 journalism is returning to its status as an activity rather than a profession
3971042 if the court reexamines the nature of press freedom what is crucial is that it recognize that any special press rights conferred by the first amendment must be based on
3971043 p 86 his fully formed arguments are a pleasure to read as they evaluate multiple sides of the issue nonetheless while gants arguments and examples are clear there is room for debate in some of his theories such room for debate can be seen as a pro or a con to the book
3971044 need for reevaluation at all levels of government of the circumstances in which special benefits are extended to those we deem journalists and denied to everyone else
3971045 only those associated with traditional news organizations are legitimate and entitled to those special privileges
3971046 as for the new media much of it is junk
3971047 should someone who produces junk really be allowed behind the scenes of the white house or granted such special privileges should they be granted trustworthy rights purely because they engage in the act of journalism
3971048 over extension of preferences is far preferable to denying press privileges

3971096 en nuestro pa s no vemos casos as el problema de estas chicas es una infecci n del coraz n producida por un germen estreptococo que si no se cura a tiempo forma anticuerpos que afectan a las v lvulas cardiacas origen de la fiebre reum tica
3971097 en espa a cualquier mam que ve que su hijo tiene una infecci n como pueden ser unas anginas o cualquier inflamaci n del sistema linf tico va al m dico para dar antibi ticos al ni o all no

3971101 a las necesidades de estacionamiento existentes en la ciudad as como a la pol tica de peatonalizaci n y rehabilitaci n del centro hist rico
3971102 a pesar de las demandas ciudadanas ahora lo pondremos en marcha para facilitar la movilidad y la accesibilidad al municipio adem s sin ning n coste para el ayuntamiento
3971103 interesadas en invertir en este proyecto lo que refleja la viabilidad de la propuesta
3971104 cuando apareci la ley se dudaba de su xito pero hemos demostrado que si se dan facilidades los padres quieren cuidar de sus hijos igual que la madre
3971105 las familias j venes aprenden a valoran m s un buen ambiente en la empresa y tiempo libre por encima del salario

3971110 est al nivel de la mejor m sica que se hace hoy en espa a
3971111 muchos granadinos han llamado en estos d as al ayuntamiento para preguntar por qu hab a desaparecido de su ubicaci n y el lunes pude comprobar in situ que no s lo la bandera sino el m stil completo se hab a esfumado de la torre de la vela
3971112 sino por el valor sentimental que para miles de granadinos ha tenido siempre ese s mbolo en ese lugar y cuya retirada nos duele mucho
3971113 me tengo que creer lo que me ha dicho pero debo entender que se trata de una decisi n tomada directamente desde sevilla sin su consentimiento
3971114 una nueva prueba de humillaci n de la junta de andaluc a hacia los granadinos
3971115 pretenden que la alhambra como instituci n viva de espaldas a la ciudad en la que se encuentra algo que hemos visto desde siempre
3971116 es buena como demuestra el consenso que ha existido en torno al plan director y muchas otras actividades

3971127 theyve been pretty excited since the start of the practice
3971128 that will be interesting to see how they respond to varsity competition
3971129 theyre pretty talented sophomores of course thats the reason theyre up on varsity
3971130 she can pass the ball she can set the ball and she can hit the cover off the ball tocarra and chaquita are girls that can put the ball away in the past weve had some girls that were able to do that but these girls are a little more consistent
3971131 its really not that much about the wins and losses in the jamboree
3971132 its really making sure that the stuff that weve worked on this summer is translating on the court
3971133 we were real inexperienced last year we have a strong returning crew back we picked up a couple strong players from jv
3971134 i was captain last year but this year is different because we have a lot more younger people on the team
3971135 you want to lead them in the right direction it is a little nerve wracking being a leader
3971136 we just try to get everyone pumped up in practice so that it carries over into the games because you practice how you play
3971137 i think we are going to be very good as long as we work together
3971138 i think we are very good individually we just need to bring it together as a team
3971139 when you start playing with people that are at a higher level than you you start playing at that level and we are already starting to see that
3971140 i think last year our biggest problem was our excitement level i think that if we can get pumped up we can be a really good team
3971141 we are all excited and ready to go we are ready for the season and are working really hard
3971142 we all hang out we all talk and i think that carries over into playing
3971143 libres de desechos residuos y vectores y en las debidas condiciones de higiene salubridad seguridad y ornato p blico
3971144 queremos que los vecinos que viven aqu sientan que el consistorio los respeta y que se mantengan los mismos servicios de limpieza y mantenimiento que en el resto de lugares de la capital
3971145 la escoba de plata se deje ver tambi n por aqu y pasen con frecuencia los servicios municipales de limpieza
3971146 our main focus is going to be our running game
3971147 we just have got to run the ball better because we were so one dimensional last year our offensive line has worked hard this summer getting stronger and quicker
3971148 i wonder how this fits in with their solemn promise of free and unrestricted reporting
3971149 in a comic sans like font spell out one by one and after that the word
3971150 its acceptable for enterprise use if the security it provides is the same as other handsets in play
3971151 theres much more granularity with these apps as the e mail is richer and it now permits background processing
3971152 neither wants to go there as its too much work and not enough pay off
3971153 apple will make its millions in the consumer space while rim will make its money in the enterprise
3971154 we take information security seriously and were always on the alert for this kind of thing
3971155 were looking into how someone got hold of that access code
3971156 make sure that any unauthorized entries wont affect their credit ratings
3971157 were taking responsibility to protect these people because thats our number one priority even if theyre not our customers
3971158 they looked around saw what everybody else was using and used the same thing
3971159 its not unusual that they dont have banking grade security applications in place
3971160 wells fargo seems to be taking the big pr hit because it was their code that was compromised but the broader solution is something microbilt has to face
3971161 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3971162 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3971163 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
3971164 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
3971165 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
3971166 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
3971167 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
3971168 if they are too big to fail make them smaller
3971169 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
3971170 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
3971171 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
3971172 i think the worst of this may well be over
3971173 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
3971174 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and leads to bad things for our society and to domestic violence
3971175 christ matthews helped to destroy delicate hillary clintons fragile shot at the presidency
3971176 hillary clinton bugs a lot of guys i mean really bugs people like maybe me on occasion
3971177 shes looking down on me what do you think howie shes looking down on me that woman she thinks shes better than me
3971178 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
3971179 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
3971180 one should also consider that we currently know of about 483 species of shark the vast majority of which grow to less than 2m 6ft and are consequently not considered to be a threat to humans a good example are the bullhead sharks such as the crested bullhead heterodontus galeatus pictured left there is no getting around the fact that sharks and many other animals attack humans but it is an understanding of the reasons behind these attacks and education that provide the greatest promise for being able to move forward ultimately without education we cannot hope to arrive at a situation where people understand the importance of sharks in the oceans and understand how to lower the risks of having a negative encounter with them there is seldom a better weapon than knowledge
3971181 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
3971182 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
3971183 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call
3971184 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected
3971185 shes got a lot of people who worked incredibly hard for her who dedicated their lives to her mission her candidacy and who are very passionate about this
3971186 this is for hillary to get the respect her campaign merits
3971187 all i can do is be me whoever that is

3971217 for visa our olympic marketing has always been about aligning with the athletes that represent the olympic spirit
3971218 the visa friendship lanes tour provides these athletes with the ability to connect with another culture while at the same time promote their sport in a way that has never been done before
3971219 between the special olympics world games and the beijing olympics its an exciting time for china and our athletes want to be a true part of the entire cultural experience
3971220 visas olympic marketing programs are designed to show the public the journey that our olympic athletes and hopefuls follow to reach their goals and dreams were very proud of our long partnership we have with michael and katie
3971221 with the visa friendship lanes tour we see an opportunity to help these great athletes inspire others and hopefully make a positive impact on the global olympic movement
3971222 when world renowned athletes like michael katie ryan and megan stand side by side with our special olympics athletes they bring recognition respect understanding and most important acceptance among the general public
3971223 their participation in the events this week in beijing and shanghai especially two special school visits and special olympics china swimming clinic encourage a call to action to society to support the more than 2 2 million special olympics athletes around the world
3971224 we are grateful to the u s olympic swimmers for their generous support of special olympics china and the global movement especially with the 2007 world summer games only six months away
3971225 we thank these champions for not only making a donation to our program but also for sharing their talents with special olympics china athletes in and out of the pool

3971233 from your comment about economic conditions and the outlook you obviously believe stock prices are high why dont you sell stocks with the idea of repurchasing at lower prices the businessman also should be aware of a problem confronting open end investment company managements
3971234 not only are people now paying 35 more when they see their nhs dentist but labours botched policies mean that millions of hard working families have completely lost access to affordable dental care
3971235 labour ministers need to own up to their mistakes stop dithering and take action now to rectify the mess theyve got the country into
3971236 labour is increasing investment in nhs dentistry so that patients now pay a lower proportion of the total cost of dental treatment than they did under the tories
3971237 we have more and more choices for an increasingly bewildered consumer and an increasingly bewildered user in terms of industries and universities

3971259 people are suddenly more interested in the political state of south africa and with elections coming up people want to know more about the past and about their leaders
3971260 there is a high interest in the book on jacob zuma the moving finger writes by moss mashamaite the biography of cyril ramaphosa anthony butler jacana 2007 has done well especially among people who are also interested in business
3971261 given the political divisions among the anc people are looking for answers people have a need to know whats going on
3971262 south africa is in a season of political doubt so a good political analysis book will sell

3971271 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3971272 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

3971313 whoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
3971314 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god has made this jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ
3971315 its so important because it shows how the holy spirit opens the doors for followers of christ to give an answer for the reason to believe
3971316 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god

3971320 sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine

3971349 we have seen the role of china changing to an inflation exporter from a global deflation exporter
3971350 the belief that china could partly help reduce the magnitude of the global economic slowdown does not seem to be valid any longer
3971351 until now economic distress in china stemmed from external fronts the fear is that many people now seem to believe that the economic problems lie in the chinese economy itself

3971368 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3971369 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3971370 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3971371 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3971372 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3971373 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

3971380 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy

3971382 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3971383 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3971384 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3971398 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3971399 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3971400 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3971401 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3971402 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3971403 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3971404 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3971405 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3971406 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3971407 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3971408 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3971409 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
3971410 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3971411 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3971412 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
3971413 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
3971414 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
3971415 yeah bomb the mess out of them take em over
3971416 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years

3971431 we expect industrial production growth to be under continued pressures from these impacts especially in the next two months
3971432 there is a little more caution both around the world and in china compared with a few months ago the japanese economy seems to be slipping into recession and europe is spluttering so in that environment you can see how china would feel the fallout
3971433 but i think theres enough home grown momentum so that china on balance will be a welcome source of demand for the world economy

3971441 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3971442 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire

3971450 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3971451 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence

3971454 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours

3971456 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3971457 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3971458 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3971459 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3971460 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3971461 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3971462 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3971463 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3971464 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3971465 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3971466 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3971467 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
3971468 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3971469 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how the two picks are clear for all the right reasons biden or clark
3971470 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done

3971483 with this senseless act of violence we have lost a good friend and honourable man
3971484 bill will be remembered for his hard work and dedication to the party and he will be sorely missed
3971485 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3971486 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3971487 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3971488 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3971489 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3971490 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
3971491 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
3971492 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3971493 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3971494 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3971495 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3971496 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3971497 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases

3971508 not a rant but more a public service announcement no politics inside
3971509 common wisdom holds that government school teachers are underpaid i couldnt disagree more
3971510 that kind of thing has any place in the campaign
3971511 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3971512 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3971513 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3971514 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3971515 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3971516 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3971517 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3971518 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3971519 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3971520 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3971521 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3971522 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3971523 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3971524 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3971525 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3971526 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms

3971536 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3971537 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3971538 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3971539 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3971540 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3971541 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3971542 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3971543 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3971544 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3971545 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
3971546 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3971547 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3971548 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3971549 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3971550 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3971551 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3971552 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3971553 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3971554 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3971555 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3971556 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3971557 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3971558 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3971559 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3971560 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3971561 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3971562 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3971563 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3971564 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3971565 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3971566 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3971567 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3971568 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3971569 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3971570 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3971571 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3971572 yes this person is a cross and his text is also a cross a real social political cross it is unfortunate that we have to deal crosses like these the truth is obama is black
3971573 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3971574 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3971575 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3971576 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3971577 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3971578 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3971579 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3971580 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3971581 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3971582 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3971583 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3971584 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3971585 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3971586 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3971587 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3971588 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3971589 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3971590 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3971591 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3971592 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3971593 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3971594 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3971595 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3971596 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3971597 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3971598 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3971599 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3971600 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3971601 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3971602 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3971603 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3971604 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3971605 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3971606 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3971607 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3971608 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3971609 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3971610 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3971611 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3971612 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3971613 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3971614 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3971615 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3971616 just so you all know we did set a record
3971617 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3971618 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3971619 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3971620 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3971621 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3971622 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3971623 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3971624 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3971625 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3971626 in every club that i played i know my qualities
3971627 at adelaide we have three strikers now for one position in the game we play
3971628 i try to give as much as i can and the coach aurelio vidmar will decide who will play
3971629 in the first half against melbourne it was our first game together and it wasnt very good
3971630 but in the second half we were much better we worked better
3971631 we played a 4 1 4 1 but i prefer to play with two strikers
3971632 i hope that all the players are fit for the game against perth and the coach must make good choices playing at home we have to win the games and then we have to play with two strikers for sure if we play at home ok we need a 4 4 2
3971633 im very excited at the versatility of our group and of the different combinations well be able to explore
3971634 its a bonus signing aaron bruce who gets in from the u s on tuesday
3971635 weve been working hard on our conditioning for an up tempo game and in aaron were bringing in a guy who flourishes in that
3971636 it means a lot for brett maher too because it takes away all his point guard responsibilities and he can just shoot the ball
3971637 his knees been great for a while but hes had some issues with his ankle which has hindered his day to day
3971638 a lot of the problems though are just wear and tear monday was far and away his best session very aggressive and he was really getting on the boards
3971639 the physio was ecstatic too about his ankles progress and how he looked
3971640 the challenge now is to get his fitness to a level of a couple of years ago
3971641 hes going head to head with jacob holmes on a daily basis and jacob is probably our fittest player
3971642 he threw down a dunk in renmark during last weeks training camp which stopped training
3971643 he brings physicality athleticism and enthusiasm you just cant help but be excited
3971644 sales are above what they were this time last season and its a pleasure to watch the boys training
3971645 i havent seen this level of intensity at the club in about five years
3971646 theres a very emotional attempt by the staff to save his life but dr pratt severely burned dies
3971647 we will collect all the information and if they are going to be long term prospects then we may be interested
3971648 it is hard to see us taking on a rookie international player in preference to someone from south australia
3971649 we have got to develop sa players to guarantee the sustainability of the team but netball is starting to become a legitimate career if you get to the top you can earn enough to just play netball for six months and then do whatever for the rest of the year
3971650 im not really surprised to get interest from england i was not expecting it but im not surprised either
3971651 to play in australia would be attractive to young england netballers
3971652 but we would only accept the cream of the crop and wont be replacing an australian youngster with an england rookie
3971653 what if you think theyre sweet you must be smokin some good stuff
3971654 ooh whats this oh hey im dead on the ground
3971655 a fascinating unique love triangle evolves between sams real in the moment friendship with annie his longing to get back to maya and the fantasy of what could be
3971656 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
3971657 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3971658 real results by the end of my first term in office
3971659 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3971660 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3971661 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3971662 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3971663 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3971664 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3971665 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3971666 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3971667 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3971668 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3971669 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3971670 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3971671 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3971672 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3971673 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3971674 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3971675 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3971676 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3971677 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3971678 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3971679 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3971680 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3971681 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3971682 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3971683 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3971684 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3971685 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3971686 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3971687 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3971688 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3971689 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3971690 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3971691 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3971692 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3971693 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3971694 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3971695 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3971696 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3971697 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3971698 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3971699 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
3971700 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
3971701 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
3971702 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
3971703 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
3971704 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3971705 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3971706 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3971707 now the discussion within the framework of the eu project
3971708 an important caveat is that the arctic sea ice in the arctic is highly variable
3971709 its quite possible we could have a very warm year that yields ice free conditions one summer but then some cooler conditions in following years that keep ice around through the summer
3971710 so once summer ice is gone in one year doesnt mean its gone for good
3971711 first there is no doubt that the central arctic will remain ice covered except during a few summer months so the specific difficulties imposed by the sea ice will remain over most months of the year
3971712 second the arctic sea ice is continuously drifting a station on the sea ice will be moving relatively to the sea floor as a consequence all activities which require instrumentation at a fixed position like drilling would have to be performed completely underwater with no direct contact to the atmosphere or as an alternative from a ship which actively melts away all the sea ice approaching its position this would require huge amounts of energy
3971713 sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources
3971714 indeed in the arctic as in the rest of the world the delimitation of the outer continental shelf is an orderly process subject to rules enshrined in unclos and to date it has been carried out in a fairly disciplined manner
3971715 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3971716 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3971717 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3971718 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3971719 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3971720 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3971721 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3971722 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3971723 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3971724 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3971725 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3971726 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3971727 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3971728 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3971729 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3971730 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
3971731 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3971732 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3971733 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3971734 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3971735 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3971736 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3971737 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3971738 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3971739 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3971740 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3971741 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3971742 como ver a paisagem pela janela de um trem em movimento
3971743 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3971744 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3971745 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3971746 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3971747 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3971748 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3971749 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3971750 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3971751 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3971752 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3971753 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3971754 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3971755 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3971756 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3971757 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3971758 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3971759 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3971760 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3971761 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3971762 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3971763 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3971764 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3971765 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3971766 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3971767 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3971768 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

3971774 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
3971775 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
3971776 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
3971777 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling

3971786 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3971787 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green

3971809 ironically while the seldom voters were the most likely to be mobilized by campaign communication they were the least likely to be contacted
3971810 those with the least active political pasts are the most likely to feel the positive effects of campaign communication
3971811 only in close contests then should we expect to see campaign contact targeted at seldom voters an unfortunate truth for those concerned with re broadening citizen engagement in the u s
3971812 if the association between leadership and health and well being described in this review represents a true relationship it would be extremely important that leadership function was considered measured and evaluated and good leadership practices were promoted in all work environments
3971813 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
3971814 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
3971815 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
3971816 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
3971817 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
3971818 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
3971819 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
3971820 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
3971821 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

3971892 the decision to have a tony bobblehead promotion was made back in february and march
3971893 when you think about the royals situation back then tony was coming off a very good year and was regarded around the league as one of the top defensive shortstops in baseball
3971894 there was really no way of anticipating that he wouldnt be the regular starter now and when we plan these promotions and carry them out its not really performance based thats not how you do them
3971895 the bobbleheads have to be produced and distributed well in advance several months in advance
3971896 well i heard that in detroit there are about 20 000 or 30 000 ivan rodriguez bobbleheads sitting around
3971897 i believe they had a promotion set up and then he got traded
3971898 you just cant account for trades or poor performance or players getting cut or whatever its the age old dilemma
3971899 fortunately in our situation this promotion is centered around a recognition of hispanic heritage and tony pe a jr is a great representative for that night

3971962 our reforms and total investment of over two billion pounds in nhs dentistry is allowing new nhs dental practices to expand and open with dental companies as well as individual dentists bidding to provide more nhs dental services around the country

3971981 it will go down as a cult classic as much as i would love to take all the credit my brother mark zane had a huge part in shooting it and without the editor hart fisher it would never have come out looking the way it did hart was essential in making it all come together the fact that it was even made makes the whole project a success to me there has never been anything like that and i dont think there will be anything similar for a while you thought it was sick you should see the euro version so it didnt sell as much as i would have hoped the press and interest was there but getting that movie placed in stores was next to impossible
3971982 i shifted gears because i didnt really have a choice
3971983 no one will shoot projects like extreme did when i was contacted by evolution erotica they asked for alt stuff and they were going to pay the bills doesnt mean i couldnt be creative it just meant i had to go more mainstream i think that i still pushed the norm and created some unique projects since i have been with them i have done some very interesting work porn stars getting real tattoos and having sex at the same time thats never been done guys performing real stunts to get laid jackass style thats new metal porn that has music vids and exclusive interviews with name music acts no one is doing that i may be in a different gear but its still creative and unique

3972012 we have a good offensive system and im not trying to come in and change a lot up
3972013 weve tweaked some things but its basically what weve been running we are going to pass about 60 percent of the time i think we can do some things and put points on the board
3972014 hopefully the change can give us a little better outside containment
3972015 with the linebackers inside that should shore up us against the inside power game i think its a style that we havent had to make a lot of adjustments in it just better fits our personnel and what were trying to do
3972016 we want to make the playoffs thats the no 1 goal
3972017 i think this is the time this is the year for us we have a good number of kids 33 on the roster with 17 seniors there have been times we havent had 17 players on the team we have depth and that could be a big key for us
3972018 in the past weve worried about what other teams are going to do and what we need to do to adjust to that this year we think its going to be the other teams adjusting to us
3972019 ive had some great orgasms and ive ascended some awesome peaks both are very different highs and both great each a little different though next up sex on the mountain now that would be a rush
3972020 det r l skigt n r det pl tsligt b rjar f rsvinna pengar
3972021 i just feel kinda guilty when my friends all seem to have all these problems with their significant others you know and i never have any complaints
3972022 well i could start verbally abusing you if you want
3972023 was that real they had better not have done that to those poor college kids
3972024 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
3972025 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
3972026 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
3972027 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
3972028 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
3972029 i know theyre working hard to get back i know the guys we have in there we have a lot of confidence in theyre guys who have played billy yates has played wes britt has played nick kaczurs played theyre going to be fine
3972030 i think any young player always has to get on the same page he works hard he comes out every day and has things he wants to work on the coaches are coaching him hard
3972031 some days it clicks some days it doesnt click then you go back in and try something new but weve all been through that
3972032 i think they know what theyre doing they know they work extremely hard you just go out there as a quarterback and do the best you can do and thats what they do and im proud of them for that
3972033 theyve got to have confidence things can happen and youve got to bounce back and do well on the next play its not like as a quarterback you have good play after good play sometimes things dont go right youve got to rebound and make the next play a good play but those guys work extremely hard and i think weve got a good quarterback group
3972034 the jets have made a lot of moves its a tough team
3972035 miamis made improvements buffalos made improvements any time you add a guy like brett favre to a team it never hurts were looking forward to playing tampa sunday night im sure when the jets come up theyll present plenty of their own challenges hes a great player
3972036 made some stuff up hey i recorded that album like four years ago
3972037 live with a steady superiority over life dont be afraid of misfortune and do not yearn after happiness it is after all all the same the bitter doesnt last forever and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing
3972038 set your mind on the things above not on the things that are on earth
3972039 he never let on one way or another whether it was up or down he was never one to complain he always had a good outlook
3972040 she never had a bad outlook on any of the problems
3972041 she always looked at the brighter side for everything that was really her attitude she could find something good in whatever was going on
3972042 thats not going to change and steven said the security people treated him with respect they even asked him if he had a ride home but im very disappointed they they would put a 16 year old out on lansdowne street
3972043 what if some drunk had said oh youre the kid who caught that ball and a fight had started if some fan had beat him up out there on the street wed be having a different conversation right now i dont know why they couldnt have had them wait in an office until i could pick them up
3972044 they called back and said if they did anything it would undermine the umpires
3972045 this is the first year weve let him go to red sox games with someone older being with him
3972046 one of the girls cousins was supposed to pick them up tickets are really hard to get and this was going to be a big night for them and he gets thrown out of one of the most exciting games of the year
3972047 i said oh my god thats my steven i finally got him on his cell phone and i told him to stay there until i drove in and got them
3972048 one witness reported the aircraft spinning two or 2 times before impact
3972049 the controller issued a low altitude alert when the aircraft was at 1 200 feet the plane should have been at 3 000 feet the pilot didnt respond
3972050 i can say that there was no distress call from the pilot
3972051 weve seen a precipitous decline in the volume of traffic and delays in the boston area
3972052 the normal run of the mill commute is much simpler in boston rush hours used to last significantly longer
3972053 it certainly seems like people are much more focused on the price of gas and alternate modes of transportation
3972054 more people are choosing to work at home and redefining where they work and how they get to work
3972055 i know that the gas prices are a significant piece of the equation
3972056 but i am equally certain that our investments into a safer and more reliable service will keep riders coming back to the t as their transportation mode of choice
3972057 i have confidence in the safety of the mbta system
3972058 we can all do better in this area no accident is acceptable but the general public should feel safe riding the mbta
3972059 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me
3972060 his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3972061 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3972062 they wont necessarily give up a bikini wax but instead of getting one every four weeks its now six
3972063 people are giving up facials and when it comes to their hair you see people stretching the bill over a few weeks instead of a cut color and highlight in one shot they come in three times over the course of a few months
3972064 to be honest i dont get facials anymore and i dont whiten my teeth i just brush them like a madwoman
3972065 theyd come in every four months for botox and now its five
3972066 the better you look the least likely youre going to be the first to go
3972067 mortons is celebrating their 30th anniversary and partnered with make a wish to grant 30 wishes for 30 years
3972068 im sorry i took all your blankets do you want one
3972069 i slept without them fine its really hot out how the hell did you sleep in all that
3972070 she asked me if i wanted to go back out with her
3972071 well you just dont understand the pain im going through
3972072 kami belum pernah mendapat informasi dari pemegang saham mayoritas carrefour red tentang rencana akuisisi ini
3972073 remember back before we got our licenses and jobs and we got a ride to the mall from my dad only to spend the money in 5 minutes and call for him to pick us up before he even got home again
3972074 yes im not going to hang my head in shame i smoke a little pot
3972075 mr orde is an outstanding citizen and were going to defend this vigorously
3972076 at this point im not sure weve picked one option over another
3972077 im always reviewing our internal procedures of custody and control
3972078 i think it made him very happy to know that it was being preserved
3972079 ive been in the art business for 25 years and i dont remember ever hearing about anything like this kind of loss of inventory
3972080 such things as water main and booster station replacement projects
3972081 we are not buying leak detection equipment we arent renewing some service plans and we are canceling vehicle replacements
3972082 we may find that we are unable to or elect not to issue or remarket certain debt securities pending the definitive ruling on the citys petition or we may find that the cost that we incur in connection with the issuance or remarketing of such debt increases materially
3972083 not many people are going to buy a 20 year bond in pennichuck
3972084 if they think we may be around for only one to five years
3972085 the public may be signaling that pursuing small time marijuana users is a waste of taxpayer resources
3972086 this issue suggests there is a libertarian streak in the thinking of the massachusetts voter
3972087 she was more than an employee and a co worker she was a really beautiful person i havent met too many people like her
3972088 she had a way of creating kindness among rivals when a situation was tense she had a way of diffusing it
3972089 she had kindness empathy and compassion and she was able to cope with everything that came to her she was everything a good noble person should be
3972090 she was like an angel to many people if you needed cheering up she was there the type of person everyone needs in life an absolutely honest and caring person you didnt have to try to get along with her
3972091 she liked working and enjoyed the people she worked with she was a very positive person with a lot of potential
3972092 kira had the knack of making everyone feel like they were her favorite person even me i know my daughter loved me she showed me that in countless ways
3972093 words cannot describe how special kira was to me she was my friend sister and a wonderful aunt to my daughter
3972094 my favorite memory of kira was that on my birthday kira took me out for ice cream by myself after church
3972095 kira held me and snuggled me in the night when i had bad nightmares
3972096 make a place for me skipping down the streets of gold one day you and me
3972097 generous and caring i think of all that you did for those around you especially me
3972098 i could talk to her about anything that was going on in my life and she always had some type of advice
3972099 its kira it just goes to show you where her heart is and how beautiful she was
3972100 dont set up any more meetings with governors it makes absolutely no sense to do this if we dont have stability in the incentive programs
3972101 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
3972102 is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale
3972103 your music helped me through a difficult period of my life
3972104 really guys i know music and you guys are fucking great
3972105 what makes these guys so cool is their ability to include everyone in this thing they have
3972106 you see you see i told you these guys rocked
3972107 got a drunk for a mother got a saint for a brother
3972108 my pleasure that was the best band ive seen on that stage in three days
3972109 i took a train down from seattle to see you guys
3972110 that doesnt mean they dont like the music they just dont dance
3972111 that was the most rock and roll thing i ever saw here
3972112 you ride her until she bucks you or you dont ride her at all
3972113 they call us that because the sesame street character oscar is always a grouch
3972114 chief gross saw the correlation there and realized that there was no communication between the departments
3972115 everyone kind of operated on their own independently without any real communication there was a lot of duplication of effort
3972116 we band together and try and handle it as a city instead of an individual entity
3972117 one of the first things we did was to identify addresses throughout the city
3972118 we actually had identified specific well slumlords i guess would be the best term
3972119 there would be things like loud music drugs often accompanied that problem in those low rent districts parking issues everything you could imagine that that would relate to density when you put too many people in too small an area and you dont do it legally issues arise
3972120 so what the police department brought to the table was immediate results that way
3972121 for the first time landlords were getting summonses to appear in court and they were just shocked
3972122 i dont care if it is an aldermans residence or if he is the landlord for the mayor or anyone else
3972123 i work for the police commission i dont answer to the city employees that is not the same for code enforcement they are city hall employees they are not insulated from interference like i am so there is a lot to be said for that when you are taking enforcement action against people in the city
3972124 we try not to displace people which is really kind of a balance
3972125 is this fit for human habitation that is the question we ask is it safe for them to stay and get their belongings out is it safe for them to stay a couple of days you make those decisions based on what is going on
3972126 there were seven kids it was a horrible weekend for me i took it home i will never forget their little faces looking out of the window
3972127 they come and collect the rent checks and kind of deliver blind permission to do what you want
3972128 you will have landlords who are horrified at potential drug or alcohol type things going on in their property
3972129 we brought accountability to some of these places and some of the drug houses were forced out of business because of that
3972130 all the officer has to do now is green tag the car
3972131 i would say after six months the difference was remarkable
3972132 i told you to address the letter to your landlord
3972133 i thought i could get some help here isnt that your job
3972134 and that is what i explained to you the last time you were being evicted
3972135 that is just one of the things we deal with here
3972136 it is not that it is wrong for them to call
3972137 it is that they are calling for the wrong reasons
3972138 they are usually surprised or act surprised when i say no
3972139 and these tenants had the nerve when asked to tell me that they were not being evicted
3972140 during the summer it is trash furniture left out unregistered vehicles
3972141 i told them were going through a bad stretch and that weve got to pull together as a team pull for each other
3972142 and that were not out of it yet obviously we need some help but most of all i dont want this season to be where everybody just quits its going to make it a long rest of the season
3972143 its a game of streaks we havent had a real bad streak until now but this is absolutely the worst time weve just got to stay positive
3972144 bringing guys in bringing guys out sitting guys down that have been here all year putting guys in youve got to get a chemistry like we had last year and youve got to roll with it
3972145 i thought jason pitched well he just gave up the big hit
3972146 i told the pitchers i dont want them to think they have to be perfect and hitters have to be perfect just go up there relax have fun enjoy the game and maybe we can turn this around
3972147 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3972148 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3972149 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3972150 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3972151 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3972152 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3972153 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3972154 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3972155 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3972156 i lost about 20 pounds but beyond that im feeling fine
3972157 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3972158 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3972159 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3972160 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3972161 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3972162 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3972163 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3972164 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in their mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong
3972165 you know that there is something that he instilled in you that allowed you to be who you are today
3972166 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3972167 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3972168 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3972169 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3972170 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3972171 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3972172 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3972173 when i was his age i was carrying three sets of pads
3972174 im glad ive been here going on my ninth year
3972175 theres only four of us who have been here that long
3972176 i was one of those rookies one of those days a new kid on the block now im the fourth oldest
3972177 any time you add a brett favre to your team it never hurts
3972178 hes going into this ninth year too hes been a starting quarterback for a long time hes going to help the team
3972179 we know what we can do its not about lining up in formation and running a play now its about getting into a better play than the one we called in the huddle and running the one we like the best
3972180 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3972181 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore
3972182 all those things were kind of on the hit parade and we will continue to work on those things about 20 percent of the time and the other 80 percent will be geared towards things that tampa bay does
3972183 kita tidak boleh menyebutkan seseorangpun dari sahabat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam kecuali dengan sebutan baik
3972184 kita juga tidak boleh berlepas diri dari salah satu sahabat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam dan tidak boleh mencintai yang satu dan mengesampingkan yang lain
3972185 keberadaan salah seorang sahabat bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam sesaat saja hal itu lebih bagus daripada amal jkita sepanjang umur meskipun umur itu panjang
3972186 kita menetapkan bahwa diantara umat islam ini orang yang paling mulia sesudah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam adalah abu bakar ash shiddiq kemudian umar kemudian utsman dan kemudian ali radhiyallahu anhum
3972187 manusia yang paling meulia setelah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa salam adalah abu bakar kemudian umar kemudian utsman dan kemudian ali selanjutnya kita tidak boleh membicarakan tentang para sahabat kecuali yang baik baik saja
3972188 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3972189 hes just a dumb christian and is just like everyone else trying to convert the non believers
3972190 i feel like the old me is dying and being reborn in a new world all alone
3972191 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3972192 were proud of you we know you can do it we know you can pull through and be the best you can be
3972193 hello are you a nice doggy can i pet you
3972194 we feel the same way about michael mcdowell as we did when we signed him
3972195 but this is the toughest most competitive form of racing in the world and i know michael and mwr can benefit from skinners input
3972196 i support doing whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3972197 no driver wants to get out of the car but i understand that every part of our program needs to be evaluated and that certainly includes me
3972198 i plan to support mike skinner and our team any way i can and hopefully learn some things that will help when i get back in the car
3972199 would michael be in the top 25 if peter had come on board earlier in the year who knows
3972200 he was not all that positive initially and im sure he probably dropped me from his christmas card list but i think im back on it now it just took him a day to digest it
3972201 well put him back in the car at richmond and run him for the rest of the year thats the plan hes not fired
3972202 gross why would anyone turn the main ingredient in guacamole into a dessert

3972210 what consumers want is to be able to find information faster and they want clues to help them find their way to that information faster
3972211 what were doing is quite unique and nobody can do what were doing
3972212 we believe were one of the top three or four alternative search engines in the marketplace
3972213 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
3972214 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
3972215 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
3972216 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words
3972217 can that behaviour be untrained if they could express things more completely in a full sentence or in a question thats to be determined google just has so much market share right now
3972218 wrap text in a box word by word as it scrolls in
3972219 its really important for jana to be with me so i dont have low blood sugar
3972220 shes able to detect high and low blood sugars by a smell thats released through the body she picks it up before a meter can
3972221 this student attended school all last year and did well without a dog the district provides this student with a one to one aide at all times
3972222 she had to carry him a couple of times to the nurse because he was going to pass out from low blood sugar so she has helped him but just as shes a tool so is the dog a tool
3972223 its easy to forget naked now particularly as within four years of its 1993 release the grim broken remnants of thatchers britain had been washed away in the triumphal swell of cool britannia when folks on those talking heads shows reminisce about the greatest british films of the 1990s they usually direct their praise to the feelgood films that reflected the euphoria of tony blairs rise to power brassed off four weddings and a funeral the fully monty even the nihilism heroin and dead babies of trainspotting was deemed acceptable in the mad fer it anything goes mid 90s

3972226 mama its so cute it looks like an ocean of octopus
3972227 we got some of our old strength back people started to respect us again
3972228 if that guy does not understand the situation well have to go farther
3972229 oh shit i never knew this was going to happen
3972230 girl we dont need those condoms we got love i trust you and you trust me so lets trust one another and let nature be what it was supposed to be after were done making possibly the dumbest decision of our lives communism
3972231 having relations with no condom is like saying i love you without actually saying it
3972232 would provide the kingdom with oil for the coming 700 years
3972233 so how are you going to get the locals to vote for a 72 year old charisma challenged geezer after all they have the opportunity of voting for mr wonderful a glib matinee idol who has graciously signaled his willingness to delay his fast track to sainthood in order to spend eight years in the white house and who has his supporters as excited as leprechauns on st patricks day
3972234 to elect john mccain the next president of the united states
3972235 john mccains message will be better received in hillsborough than obamas
3972236 hes mccain experienced and ready on day one on national security issues he understands the need to hold the line on both government spending and taxes obamas liberal voting record will not play well in hillsborough
3972237 it may satisfy for an hour or so but it doesnt sustain because its empty calories
3972238 seriously the arguments of bush administration critics from the brennan center or the nation magazine they have pulled the very rug out from under themselves their sudden interest in obedience to the constitution rings hollow
3972239 the owners of the nations steel mills had refused to negotiate any wage increase until they received assurances from the federal governments office of price stabilization yes there really was such a thing in 1951 that they would be permitted to increase steel prices adequately at the same time
3972240 the civil rights act of 1964 had specifically forbidden court ordered busing schemes to achieve racial balance
3972241 in 1942 the supreme court outdid itself in its commerce clause jurisprudence with wickard v filburn
3972242 found that a farmer growing wheat for his own use on his own land was subject to federal regulation
3972243 b ecause he affected interstate commerce had he not grown his own wheat he might have purchased it from another state thus his abstention from purchasing wheat from other states affects interstate commerce and thereby makes his activity subject to federal control
3972244 to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes
3972245 instead of vetoing legislation bush found he could sign it into law and simply refuse to carry out those provisions that under his expansive view of executive power he considered unconstitutional
3972246 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time
3972247 obamas dont ask dont drill policy spurns modern technology and embraces outdated information gathered with obsolete instruments this is the audacity of ignorance
3972248 there is no future for expanded nuclear power without first addressing four key issues public right to know security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
3972249 its in the chemistry labs that are laying the building blocks for cheaper more efficient solar panels and its in the re born factories that are churning out more wind turbines every day all across this country
3972250 encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power solar power and geothermal energy
3972251 experts have said that michigan has the second best potential for wind generation and production in the entire country and as the worlds largest producer of the material that makes solar panels work the production tax credit would also help states like michigan grow solar industries that are already creating hundreds of millions of jobs
3972252 working with farm owners to develop this states wind potential and developing nanotechnology that will make solar cells cheaper
3972253 we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and businesses
3972254 will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3972255 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
3972256 well invest more in the research and development of these plug in hybrids specifically focusing on the battery technology
3972257 by 2022 i will make it a goal to have 6 billion gallons of our fuel come from sustainable affordable biofuels
3972258 directing billions in loans and capital to entrepreneurs who are willing to create clean energy businesses and clean energy jobs right here in america
3972259 invest federal resources including tax incentives and government contracts into developing next generation biofuels

3972263 the message is that carl anderson and the knights of columbus dont believe that politicians can any longer claim other reasons or policy matters as excuses for inaction following the loss of over 40 million lives since roe v wade
3972264 it is time for us to say if you want my vote as a catholic youre not going to get it if you vote for abortion period and that is not just aimed at the democrats as some people might suggest it includes anyone who votes for abortion

3972268 everyone would agree pawlenty has been vetted in some way
3972269 and even pawlenty has changed his previous position when he said he hasnt been asked to hand over any documents to refusing to speak about the vice presidential position at all if youre reading between the lines like some people are this adds to the speculation

3972299 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3972300 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3972301 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3972302 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3972303 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3972304 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3972310 we have this many because our program has grown steadily over the past 17 years and boasts a 90 percent retention and graduation rate we owe that success to the involvement of truly caring and committed individuals who not only generously give of their financial support but also their time

3972355 the womens battle in the 21 st century therefore is not one against the government rather against a way of thinking for example in the case of democrat hillary clinton a woman that has gotten involved in what has formerly been a male dominated race though the fact that a women running for president is a wonderful idea as it shows the remarkable progress america has made the ridiculous criticisms she receives regarding her actions as a woman are what truly show americas inability to rise to the occasion of having a woman as president an ice queen or an emotional wreck clinton is continually ridiculed if americans could only think of women in a brighter light as an integral part of our society that adds depth strength intelligence and so much more to our american character then maybe the womens fight for equality would no longer be a fight but instead a reality
3972356 as to whether news is manufactured or made up for the titillation of the consumer lets look at some of the stories dominating our headlines this august the hamiltons british troops in macedonia the missing 15 year old danielle jones four hospital deaths caused by blocked oxygen tubes a possible cure for cjd of all these stories only the hamiltons could possibly be manufactured with the help of a pr agent its true that pr agents and government spin doctors are becoming more and more sophisticated at manipulating the media but equally journalists and the public are becoming more cynical about what is put in front of them

3972365 kirsty lang from the bbc in recent weeks weve seen increasing evidence of anti american feeling growing in the world and i was wondering how you felt the best way was to combat this and with what messages do you hope to combat that mr holliday it is true that weve seen evidence of increasing anti americanism i think that there are two broad reasons for this one is that of course since the end of the cold war we have obviously developed more independent views of essentially the world order that existed between world war ii and the fall of the berlin wall that had many associated exchange and interactions between whether its nato various non nato allies development programs around the world i think that we have seen that we as the media space begins to fill and it has over the last decade there has been explosion throughout the world that the united states in the humble way that the president has talked about must be there and must engage whether its education and cultural programs like the fulbright and the international visitor program or informational programs like these publications or speakers that we send around the world

3972372 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3972373 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3972374 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3972375 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3972376 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3972377 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3972378 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3972379 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted

3972381 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
3972382 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market mr shum said
3972383 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing he said
3972384 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted

3972388 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3972389 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
3972390 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
3972391 this case has taken 10 years in trial court it cannot be treated as an ordinary case this was a clear case of criminal negligence priority ought to have been given to its hearing so that people can have confidence in judiciary
3972392 the system should not be allowed to suffer and nobody should be allowed to manipulate it

3972394 i knew it was going to be a tough match

3972404 commissioner toumpas has been making some very positive steps to resolve the differences weve been experiencing
3972405 it would be fair for us to characterize it by saying the situation is improving
3972406 it is inherent upon him to disclose the fact that he is a registered sex offender
3972407 its a great organization that does a lot of good in the seacoast and he did not disclose
3972408 no one was aware of it at the time that he took the position
3972409 i dont have an answer for that right now i will at some point
3972410 we want to know all of the facts too before we say anything further
3972411 we are working with police were helping them and im sure well have more to say once they complete their investigation

3972415 while the subject matter may be tangentially related to the charge of capital murder and the statutory aggravating factors the conversations or statements do not tend in any way to make more probable that he addison knowingly caused the death of officer briggs nor are they indicative of any consciousness of guilt
3972416 we respectfully disagree with her decisions and we continue to prepare for trial
3972417 i dont anticipate appealing the decisions on the motions challenging the death penalty prior to trial
3972418 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3972419 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3972420 do i dance around like a dumb fuck to this song a lot
3972421 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3972422 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3972423 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3972424 we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
3972425 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3972426 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3972427 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3972428 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3972429 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3972430 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3972431 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3972432 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3972433 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3972434 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3972435 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3972436 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3972437 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3972438 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3972439 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3972440 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3972441 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3972442 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3972443 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3972444 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3972445 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3972446 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3972447 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3972448 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3972449 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3972450 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3972451 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3972452 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3972455 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3972456 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3972457 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3972458 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3972459 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3972460 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3972461 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3972462 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3972463 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3972464 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3972465 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3972466 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3972467 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3972468 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3972469 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3972470 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3972471 i feel good the guys have been really kind and just getting adjusted has been the first step here
3972472 he showed us early that he has plenty of stuff to pitch here hes got good deception and kind of herky jerky motion which makes his curveball and changeup effective
3972473 what i like most about him is his mound presence for a kid just making his first trip up here to double a hes aggressive and he doesnt get affected by anything around him
3972474 this was sort of a soft opening practice day for us to work out the kinks but by 7 a m on the nose there was somebody here and by 7 05 a m he had a giant eclair and a coffee sitting in front of him
3972475 i think there has been a lot of hoopla about us opening here and about the project itself and people are just dying to see what we have done
3972476 its been in the works for five or six months now but now its finally come to fruition and to have so many people be a part of it is just awesome
3972477 thats been my favorite comment but people seem to love them and have been buying them
3972478 were really excited to launch all the new things and i hope it works out at this store
3972479 the thing i thought that was really nice about the spot is the owner michael was charming and extremely helpful
3972480 i also thought they offered the most interesting little chocolate truffle covered with chili pepper it was a really interesting combination of flavors and its nice to be able to get something different like that here in merrimack
3972481 those are the same type of cooler doors that were part of an original meat locker from the 1920s and 1930s era
3972482 if there was one element we were going to keep it was that and i think it looks nice and people have said how much they like that aspect of the store
3972483 i think it adds to the modernization and it kind of foreshadows where the town of merrimack is going
3972484 the atmosphere of the building itself is very relaxed and i like the fact that its a coffeehouse kind of feel
3972485 offered mccain a job in gift shop at the obama presidential library
3972486 certified delegates and alternates and non certified delegates and alternates
3972487 i expect that this e mail will not be forwarded or leaked to the media aside from that being a gross violation of trust i hope you will understand that at this time it is not in new hampshires interest for there to be a broad public discussion of how exactly our full delegation will be handled
3972488 received some clarification on how our full delegation will be handled at the convention both from a formal letter from the rnc and some informal conversations with both rnc and mccain officials
3972489 non certified delegates and alternates will be called honored guests you will receive credentials that will get you access to the convention hall and all other venues we will have enough guest passes so that the honored guests may bring guests so keep your flight and hotel plans for both you and your guest if applicable
3972490 honored guests will not have votes and will not be able to participate in floor debate
3972491 where everyone will sit exactly is still to be determined however there are generally speaking separate sections for delegates for alternates and for guests our certified delegates will be in the delegate section on the floor and our certified alternates will be in the alternate section where exactly our honored guests and their guests will sit remains unclear at this time
3972492 i am disappointed in you fergus for not standing up for the nh delegation
3972493 i had very high hopes for you as our gop chair and as you know supported you throughout the process but you kow towed to the rnc on this issue
3972494 nh is a proud state and we hold our status as the first primary state in the nation also and just as important the delegates selected by the candidates based on the voters preference in the presidential primary should be supported at the very least by our state chair
3972495 taken the position that if our entire delegate was not seated then no one should be seated that action in my opinion would have reached the highest levels in the rnc as well as the nation that nh is still an independent state when it comes to gop politics
3972496 what you did in essence is to allow without even a whimper one half of the nh delegation to become guests rather than delegates
3972497 sit idly by and allow this travesty to go by unnoticed
3972498 furthermore your lack of support for one half the nh delegation to this years convention will not go unnoticed the next time the state gop selects a chair you can bet your last dollar that i wont be in your corner
3972499 its a real shame that your lack of support and that of our national committeeman
3972500 and previous committee members including tom rath and that of the mccain organization has allowed this to occur
3972501 i think the chairman of the republican state committee let us down i think the mccain organization at the highest levels let us down we were assured by senator mccain that he would do everything possible to seat all the delegates
3972502 but to de certify 12 people who had been prepared to be on hand and to relegate them to guest status is in my opinion a disgrace
3972503 new hampshire is the number one primary state and we should have stood firm and said that if you dont seat half of us then all of us are going to refuse to participate
3972504 obviously doesnt control the republican national committee at least not at this point
3972505 im not going to spend the money and fly out there just to be relegated to non delegate status
3972506 senator mccain said all along that he would pledge his utmost efforts to preserving the new hampshire primary and that has always been the key objective of new hampshire
3972507 what some people in new hampshire fail to appreciate but i appreciate more and more
3972508 is that while we think its important for democracy to have the first in the nation primary most states do not share that view and in fact most states do not think that new hampshire should be first
3972509 have made good progress but the plan is under attack in some quarters delegations in michigan california and texas may be trying to overturn it
3972510 is not in control of the republican national committee fully
3972511 has been extraordinarily cooperative and we have found a way to allow the seating of the delegates from the states that broke the rules this was a compromise and its a wonderful compromise in my view
3972512 id be happy to be a guest instead of a delegate we thought this was a great way for all of our delegates and guests to get great seats and passes to every event and at the same time not stick a thumb in the eye of the written rule adopted by the convention four years ago its unwise to argue about seating the delegates at the expense of aggravating the situation and making it harder to pass a plan to keep new hampshire first
3972513 and unlike the republican party we have a full delegation going and being seated we are fully participating
3972514 i heard from somebody else that theres something thats pretty damaging that could be used late but that person wont be able to inaudible
3972515 rumor has it that there is some dirt on betsi devries
3972516 i dont even know what the thing is but there is supposedly some information out there that is not good for betsi devries if it does come out
3972517 its my hope that bob will agree to run an issues based campaign rather than resorting to scare tactics distortion and cheap campaign trickery
3972518 misleading remarks that are disparaging in nature untrue or harmful to my opponents personal reputation and that of their family
3972519 a gimmick to allow ted gatsas to once again buy a senate seat i dont have teddys millions and i have to rely on friends and supporters who think his votes are not what we deserve i have never run a negative campaign and will once again run a campaign based on the issues
3972520 contact their elected officials to advocate for small more streamlined government and great government transparency
3972521 when it comes to reducing the price of oil jeanne shaheen simply has no idea what she is taking about
3972522 more and more people are finding work and getting off of welfare
3972523 lets show the liberal elites what we already know they are no match for team sununu
3972524 when im not in the lineup im trying to figure out what i can do to get back in there i take pride in doing whatever it takes
3972525 ive had my windows of opportunity now im just trying to prove everyone wrong that told me i wasnt going to make it not only individuals but organizations
3972526 if the phone doesnt ring at the end of the year i can walk away from baseball knowing that i gave it everything i had on and off the field and i was model citizen and things like that
3972527 i would hope so but baseballs a funny game my older brother jason spent six years in the major leagues and the phone didnt ring for him last off season
3972528 he prepares every day as well as anybody he gives you quality at bats every time hes in there and he thinks the game on defense
3972529 imagine taking something youve done your entire life something youve loved and its the only thing you really known how to do
3972530 i didnt know what i was going to do with the rest of my life ive played baseball since i was a kid i wasnt much of a school guy so getting released was a shocker for me
3972531 im glad the blue jays gave me a call maybe its a blessing in disguise
3972532 i was just having fun and playing the game it was my first year playing with those guys in dunedin and we established a good relationship right off the bat
3972533 they can call neighbor to neighbor they have partial service
3972534 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3972535 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3972536 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3972537 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3972538 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3972539 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3972540 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3972541 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3972542 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3972543 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3972544 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3972545 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3972546 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3972547 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3972548 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3972549 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3972550 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3972551 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3972552 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3972553 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3972554 in a way the move is revolutionary it is really heartening that now the daughters will get equal rights in landed properties of their father
3972555 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3972556 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3972557 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3972558 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3972559 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3972560 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3972561 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3972562 who are open to doing something on the production side
3972563 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3972564 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3972565 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3972566 we have drafted a proposal the report of the mentor group will be finalized by the time ea summit will be held in bangkok in december
3972567 it will be followed by an act of the indian parliament that will formalize the establishment of the university
3972568 the foundation stone for the university will be laid sometime in february next year
3972569 the prime minister was very supportive kalam has agreed to be a visitor to the university and play the role of advisor
3972570 its a global university and its also an asian university its a reflection of the rise of asia in the world and goes back to days when asia was dominant
3972571 the destruction of the nalanda university in the 12th century coincided with the establishment of oxford university
3972572 nalanda is the only educational establishment where the chinese went for higher education
3972573 you can do more evil when you do it legal

3972576 it is a well known fact that europe is the heart of expertise in the world of hospitality training avalons tie up with sci will provide an opportunity to indian students to get an exposure to training in hospitality management at par with international standards and get a head start in this arena
3972577 at present the hospitality industry is experiencing a boom time in fact this has emerged as the worlds fastest growing job creating profession

3972586 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3972587 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3972588 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

3972590 it was observed that the issue of vacancies of seats in the iit system is a matter of concern and therefore a very comprehensive review is necessary while doing so the most important point to be kept in mind is that the iits brand equity should not be diluted
3972591 all the seven old iits have filled all their seats for the year 2008 09 in the regular as well as preparatory courses as for the new iits the issue of 66 vacancies in seats reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was reviewed
3972592 in the six new iits will be made available for the admission exercise for 2009 10 as a one time measure
3972593 there is no vacancy in obc other backward classes seats though we lowered the cut off slightly yet it was a little difficult to find suitable scheduled tribes candidates hence this vacancies
3972594 though the old iits have come forward to mentor the six new ones there are several difficulties in conducting the regular classes of these institutions at locations away from the main campuses
3972595 nowhere in india or the world has anyone heard of a six hour shift with a fat pay
3972596 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3972597 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3972598 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3972599 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3972600 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
3972601 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
3972602 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
3972603 you have no value people insult you you barren woman you are useless its horrible and if you are not strong you will not survive
3972604 the number of clients is going up by the day
3972605 some ask to come at night so theyll not be seen some call whispering sometimes they dont want to give you their name they come saying my husband is going to leave me if i dont have children and the men once they find out they come every day if they have an appointment at 9 a m they show up at 8
3972606 we lost a very important symbol of our nationalism and our cultural heritage
3972607 o mahmoud o darwish in our hearts you will live
3972608 liberated the old arabic poetry from its constraints and made it accessible to a big audience
3972609 there were numerous reports that the russian regular army let the irregulars into the city this morning and immediately after that we started getting desperate calls from the people saying help us they are looting they are humiliating us they are crushing our houses
3972610 to get them out of the city and to let the police in
3972611 everything is calm in gori the only thing that is frightening the people is your president saakashvili son of bush
3972612 at this point were going to give those kids every opportunity we can until we gain a better idea where we are
3972613 i really got stronger in my faith and i think putting all my trust in him made the difference between this year and years past
3972614 the more games you play the more comfortable youre going to get
3972615 i think it was more that i was getting myself out swinging at pitches i shouldnt be missing
3972616 im not going to change anything with my swing its more my approach im going to go back to keeping things simple
3972617 he should feel good about where hes at this year
3972618 there may be some interest from a contending club in him thats what were hoping
3972619 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3972620 i can tell you that recent developments between russia and georgia give us no proof that dmitry medvedev is an independent leader
3972621 one scene was very clear when putin began to tell the president what to do it was not a private conversation putin wanted to show that he was in charge
3972622 no one thought about a session of duma no one even bothered
3972623 they should allow chaplains perhaps one from each country to be in the village this is important because for many of us athletics is not only physical and mental but spiritual
3972624 this is yet another example of iocs failure to enforce and to stand up to chinas efforts to roll back basic freedoms that have been taken granted at previous olympics
3972625 one officer asked me in english what were my views of tibet
3972626 i told him i was a journalist and didnt have any views
3972627 one of our chinese staff asked why they arrested me and an officer said didnt you see
3972628 pointing to the yellow cloth they had thrown into the van
3972629 i was there merely to report not to take part in anything i didnt have a banner i didnt have a t shirt i was wearing pretty standard foreign correspondent garb
3972630 you cant help but run into members everywhere you turn theres a potential voter all 115 are just waiting and anxious to talk to you
3972631 you get a real sense of the scale and size and complexity of it all
3972632 we knew that but when you see it in person it becomes even more realistic to you
3972633 theyre accessible theres a lot of interest in 2016 developing i dont think that theyre ready yet to get into the detail of the bid but they want to know about the cities they dont give any sense of preference theyre really happy to have four world class cities
3972634 the attention is starting to turn were having much more substantive and serious conversations than ever before i have members coming up to me and wanting to know the inside scoop on our bid fortunately ive got a strong story to tell
3972635 there is a very very strong interest in the election
3972636 its amazing how great is the knowledge about the candidates
3972637 barack obama hails from chicago and lives four blocks from the site of the opening and closing ceremony
3972638 there is no denying that barack living a few blocks from the olympic village will be more closely associated with the bid
3972639 i think it will a very important opportunity for the new president to say the u s wants the olympic movement to come back we want to welcome the whole world to chicago and the u s
3972640 the decisions are made at the last minute the advice were getting from ioc members has been stay humble and work work work until the very end thats what we will do
3972641 remains committed to participating in any meaningful and genuine dialogue that urgently moves this process forward
3972642 mugabes eagerness to hold on to executive powers to appoint ministers and chair the cabinet prompted tsvangirai to make the eleventh hour u turn
3972643 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3972644 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters

3972661 its one of those things where you dont really realize how much it means to you until youre not doing it anymore
3972662 we thoroughly enjoyed our week on the american star sailing from one small town to another allowed us to feel the differences in personality and prosperity we learned what made the towns historically grow from fishing farming mining paper mills ship building and when their fortunes changed how the locals were able to cope and find other sources to sustain their economy tourism and the summer population bring maine alive with its history and beautiful coastline we truly loved this trip
3972663 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond home depot and the solution is certainly more complicated than placing mandates on businesses
3972664 all of this is flying in the face of what the city is supposed to be doing in terms of upholding the law

3972672 this use of language made it possible for the moravians to conceal dangerous false doctrines and create a state within a state
3972673 ozone depletion is not the cause of the increase in skin cancers
3972674 every year we go through this five month stress test
3972675 we cant assume there is a therapeutic benefit from taking the vitamin
3972676 the levels we see today in developed countries are relatively unusual especially from an evolutionary standpoint
3972677 increased sun exposure may lead to improved cancer prognosis and possibly give more positive than adverse health effects
3972678 the main arguments against the concept that sun exposure causes cutaneous malignant melanoma cmm are that 1 cmm is more common among persons with indoor work than among those people with outdoor work 2 in younger generations more cmms arise per unit skin area on partly shielded areas trunk and legs than on face and neck and 3 cmms sometimes arise on totally shielded areas soles of feet palms inside the eyeball
3972679 most chemical sunscreens contain from 2 to 5 of benzophenone or its derivatives oxybenzone benzophenone 3 as their active ingredient
3972680 benzophenone is one of the most powerful free radical generators known to man
3972681 researchers at the harvard medical school have recently discovered that psoralen another ultraviolet light activated free radical generator is an extremely efficient carcinogen they found that the rate of squamous cell carcinoma among patients with psoriasis who had been repeatedly treated with uva light after a topical application of psoralen was 83 times higher than among the general population
3972682 prostate breast colon and lung cancers as well as lymphomas and even melanomas
3972683 other investigators have found comparable results these data argue for a positive role of sun induced vitamin d in cancer prognosis or that a good vitamin d status is advantageous when in combination with standard cancer therapies
3972684 our recent investigations show that a high sun bed induced vitamin d level cannot be maintained by daily intakes of the recommended amount of vitamin d 200 units in the form of cod liver oil pills
3972685 thus we conclude that the sun is an important source of vitamin d so far epidemiological data for cancer argue for an overall positive role of sun induced vitamin d there may be more beneficial than adverse effects of moderately increased sun exposure even for total cancer mortality
3972686 the questions are how much do we take and do we expose ourselves to sunlight
3972687 we hypothesize that good vitamin d levels might prevent or mitigate the disease
3972688 vitamin d may be the most potent antibiotic that exists
3972689 maybe the shot people need to get in the fall is not a flu shot but a vitamin d shot our ancestors got it every day in africa
3972690 there is no definite answer about how much sun you can tolerate
3972691 if you are trying to generate vitamin d just take it by mouth
3972692 were finding more and more kids are presenting with evidence of vitamin d malnutrition
3972693 we thought that vitamin d was a very narrow acting substance
3972694 the big surprise is that its got a lot of important biological effects that probably contribute to our health and were just now beginning to uncover them
3972695 are we getting enough vitamin d no were not especially in the winter
3972696 a lot of people with aches and pains and marginal weakness could be helped by vitamin d supplements
3972697 one patient with chest pain had multiple balloon angioplasties and his pain never went away
3972698 he also had surgery for his low back pain but he didnt get any better
3972699 i measured his vitamin d level and it was basically zero
3972700 his chest and low back pain were not due to cardiac or spinal disease but to low vitamin d we put him on prescription strength vitamin d and he got much better we had spent over 200 000 on him in the hospital for these other procedures without doing a 20 blood test
3972701 our study supports a possible role for vitamin d in the prevention of ms
3972702 further studies are needed to confirm the findings but taking a multiple vitamin as part of a healthy diet cant hurt
3972703 the amount of vitamin d in our diet is totally inadequate
3972704 we are in an era of sunphobia that is not being exposed to any direct sunlight thats being promoted widely by the dermatology community and its probably hurting peoples health more than its helping them
3972705 that message needs to be modified and moderated to a more sensible approach so that people can get a little bit of safe sun
3972706 if you go to the literature where people are talking about sunlight and cancer risk nobody mentions that you need sun for vitamin d
3972707 by the same token if you go to the vitamin d literature where people are talking about skin irradiation to get vitamin d nobody talks about cancer
3972708 one of the first things that might be necessary is to get the skin cancer people together with vitamin d requirement people
3972709 there are questions that need to be addressed before meaningful public health policy can go forward
3972710 our melanoma incidence and mortality rates which are among the highest in the world
3972711 the cancer society of new zealand has supported sun protection and skin cancer control research and activities since the 1980s
3972712 in july 2007 the society again brought together a multi disciplinary expert advisory group with the key objectives of 1 reviewing new evidence on vitamin d sun exposure amp health and 2 revising the current position statement
3972713 a key conclusion of this commissioned review was that there was
3972714 however other epidemiologists have queried the strength of this protective effect given the quantity and quality of evidence currently available
3972715 recognising the contested nature of these findings the cancer society believes that the key conclusion of the commissioned review is
3972716 other potentially avoidable causes of cancer include dietary factors alcohol and sunlight
3972717 the latest studies show that vitamin d can aid the immune system and help prevent auto immune conditions such as diabetes and thyroid problems
3972718 vitamin d deficiency during childhood and adolescence might impair the acquisition of peak bone mass at the end of skeletal growth and maturation thereby increasing the risk of osteoporosis fracture in later life
3972719 wayne hoffman the man behind todays launch if you havent read the bill sali s office and his spokesman wayne hoffman to task on several issues its created a bit of a firestorm bloggers seem surprised that this rightwing newspaper would speak up on this
3972720 they took the entire matter out of context in my mind and i worked for the press tribune for four years it borders on libel
3972721 i know im hot but if you look at me again i will fucking kill you
3972722 certainly at the birthplace trust we have people coming in especially women who say we are here to see hamlet and so we thought we would come and find out more about what its all about
3972723 i think the rsc is riding the crest of a wave with david tennant
3972724 the production is drawing in people from further afield than normal so people are spending more time in the town and going on the stratford trail
3972725 they are coming in for an evening show and spending the day and possibly overnight in town
3972726 the credit crunch has affected overseas tourists more so than in the uk
3972727 its not that us visitors are staying away completely its that they are not arriving in coachloads as they once did
3972728 but we are seeing a lot more local visitors exploring whats on their own doorsteps
3972729 it is difficult to measure the tennant effect because the rsc have had a number of record seasons in a row
3972730 but i would argue that as hamlet has been sold out since may this year that there is definitely a positive impact
3972731 a lot of people are not shakespeare fans but they are stratford fans
3972732 they come to see the river and the town of course we would like more visitors and we would like them to stay longer

3972750 most industrial countries are showing symptoms of over heating in the housing market
3972751 one simply cannot ignore the number of indicators that are now simultaneously exhibiting marked deviations
3972752 weve had a 30 year leveraging up of america ending in an unchecked orgy
3972753 the final straw was the feds hopelessly slow tightening from 2004 onwards there was no excuse for the interest rates of 1pc and then they went through this ludicrous metronome dance of quarter point hikes
3972754 by making banks raise capital against their balance sheets it gave them a strong incentive to move off balance sheets
3972755 policymakers interpreted the quiescence in inflation to mean that there was no good reason to raise rates when growth accelerated and no impediment to lowering them when growth faltered
3972756 my sympathies go to the unfortunate citizens of those countries that implement inflation targeting
3972757 the troubles in the sub prime sector seem unlikely to spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
3972758 the fed was in this mental state that it was just a short term problem
3972759 their biggest mistake was that they failed to realise how far the real estate market would fall
3972760 if his lordship is a total religious nutter why did ilargi post it

3972762 linux is only free if your time is worth nothing
3972763 xp and vista are like air conditioning only works properly if you dont open any windows
3972764 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling
3972765 home prices will drop for quite a while maybe several years
3972766 price declines lead to more defaults which leads to more price declines
3972767 time will break the cycle pricing will drop enough to attract more buyers and inventories will decline
3972768 this is consistent with our view that consumer spending will slow markedly over the next several quarters
3972769 this in turn would be another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3972770 goldman is not immune to capital market pressures especially given perhaps weaker european growth
3972771 customer volumes overall weak equity markets and weak advisory and underwriting revenues
3972772 though times are different and a lot of the government spending is necessary were going to see rates rise in a saw tooth pattern over the next few years
3972773 i used to think that if there was reincarnation i wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a 400 baseball hitter but now i would like to come back as the bond market you can intimidate everybody
3972774 the demand from the treasury is just going to be huge
3972775 china and other governments have not been demanding higher interest rates as the deficit increased because their main motive has been to prevent their currencies from appreciating
3972776 the one thing we had going for us at that time was inflation credibility
3972777 that credibility is starting to erode for the first time in two decades so it becomes far less certain that foreign investors will continue to bail us out
3972778 there could be a renewed flight from the dollar and from our bonds
3972779 if we continue to run these large deficits not only bond traders but the securities markets are suddenly going to awaken with concern about whether or not the administration is doing anything to discipline the budget
3972780 its just a matter of time before they start to put pressure on a new administration
3972781 you mean to tell me that the success of the economic program and my re election hinges on the federal reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders
3972782 to the extent that either one of them believe or pretend the budget deficit is going to be balanced in their term they are talking fiction
3972783 intermediate and long term yields on government bonds have already bottomed and will gradually rise throughout your first and perhaps second administration
3972784 markets are much bigger and much more closely linked to different options and derivatives
3972785 not even mr soros would have a chance of having an effect on the big capital markets any longer
3972786 has receivership powers that would place the non senior creditors at a greater risk of nonpayment
3972787 performance of the company over the past year has shown that the risk controls havent worked
3972788 the firm has said its making changes to the risk management systems
3972789 today were expanding our investigation into the auction rate securities scandal to insure investors across new york state and the nation get their money back
3972790 we believe that when you protect the investor you also increase investor confidence which helps the entire market
3972791 cooperating with all regulatory inquiries we have received regarding auction rate securities
3972792 our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3972793 any resolution would need to address the same concerns addressed in the
3972794 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3972795 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3972796 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3972797 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3972798 at this point bob steel wasnt part of the problem so he has nothing to hide
3972799 he has everything to gain by putting it all out on the table and saying this is how bad it is and it might get worse
3972800 nobody is insulated from this it seems like every time you turn around somebody else is taking a billion dollar write down
3972801 it has been volatile even after this went into effect
3972802 im not sure it will get back to where it was a month ago
3972803 short sellers didnt make the stock go down they didnt lever up the company
3972804 and they didnt lower the fed funds rate or tell people to take out arms adjustable rate mortgages when they shouldnt have
3972805 its going to be a bloody expensive mess for the banking industry
3972806 healthy banks are paying for the mistakes made by failed banks
3972807 raising rates is our first and best option if we need to get more revenue to increase the fund and the reserve ratio
3972808 certainly the industry is ready to step up to the plate and make sure the fdic is financially secure
3972809 that has to be balanced against the fact that money coming back to washington is money that banks cant use
3972810 its still very small historically and unlikely to cause significant problems to the fdic fund
3972811 so if armageddon scenarios did play out the peoples deposits would be backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government
3972812 even if we did have to call upon our taxpayers backstop our statute requires us to pay back those funds over time through industry assessment
3972813 lack of demand due to market funds non availability for the bottom end of the market has caused the market to slow almost to a stop
3972814 sales are still very scarce buyers are confused but some are having to move forward to take account of life changes
3972815 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
3972816 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
3972817 this is why most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
3972818 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the last 12 months
3972819 a sharp economic slowdown is a new experience for many people in government and in business
3972820 i would not chase the dollars strength versus the euro as the pair has moved beyond interest rate support
3972821 the dollar is not out of the woods it will take the market a while to come around to our point of view
3972822 the market is dropping heavily these days because of deeper worries about an economic slowdown
3972823 corporate performance is lagging and even with oil prices stabilizing increasing material costs are likely to weigh on companies
3972824 theres a lack of direction right now it really depends on the performance of a shares
3972825 if the chinese authority takes measures that will help if they dont we could see more selling
3972826 theres a slowing in the economy there will be less and less appreciation in the currency
3972827 for the next three to six months we could see a weaker yuan
3972828 it would be the wrong decision to close long yuan exposure at these levels
3972829 theres no opportunity to make money on the yuan revaluation
3972830 the u s has no reason or justification to push for further appreciation
3972831 the u s needs money to clean up the collapse of its housing market and that will require a stronger dollar to lure back investors
3972832 even though oil prices have been coming down in recent weeks companies will keep trying to raise prices because theyve made up for only a fraction of the cost increases theyve suffered
3972833 rising so rapidly that its too difficult to recover profits with cost cutting efforts alone
3972834 will probably stay around 5 percent through the end of this year and then gradually head in the opposite direction next year
3972835 we expect core prices will rise 2 2 percent in july and 2 3 percent in september
3972836 even though crude oil prices are being adjusted now the ongoing cost push inflation wont weaken easily
3972837 theres a realization now that the canadian economy is weak even flirting with recession
3972838 the recent declines in commodity prices have had an impact but more fundamental is the weakness in the canadian economy
3972839 weve seen signs of weak data particularly on the housing side an area which had been a bastion of strength
3972840 the canadian economy is quite sluggish giving some weight to the view that the bank of canada might cut rates sooner than expected
3972841 even if i were the most bearish man on earth i cant imagine buying puts 50 percent below the price with just over a week to expiration
3972842 its not even on the page of rational behavior unless you know something
3972843 would you buy 1 7 million worth of lottery tickets just because you could no neither would a hedge fund manager
3972844 an incredible amount of bearish activity could have been generated by just 10 to 15 people
3972845 other people then pile in because they think somebody knows something
3972846 in just one tick the companys share price lost nearly all its value a steeper drop than enrons right before its de listing in 2001
3972847 ive never seen a stock perform like that in my life
3972848 nobody prepares for the stock going from 57 to 3 in just two days
3972849 lots of reasons why people could have a financial motivation to induce panic
3972850 somebody placed some big bets that day that paid off
3972851 nobody in their right mind would buy that put unless you knew what was going down
3972852 when you buy 5 strikes when the stock is trading over 50 you either have to be manipulating or you have to have insider information
3972853 it looks to me like bear stearns got riddled with bullets
3972854 the pool of players willing and able to acquire us risk assets is being depleted by the week to be sure the unfolding change of fortunes for the leveraged speculating community is one more key facet of tighter system credit and faltering marketplace liquidity extremely problematic financial conditions for the finance driven us bubble economy and this makes the current market dislocations in the face of rapidly deteriorating fundamentals such a dangerous development
3972855 the automatic earth covers it in one sentence markets are deleveraging absolutely leveraged positions are having their loans phased out they must sell out and make good the losses or take out the residual profits big commodity players leverage no different than yen trade players or asset backed mortgage hedge funds the collapse of sem fuel is no different than the five day collapse of carlyle capital corporation who leveraged aaa government implied guarantee mortgages speculation is reversing what speculation drove up trading is speculation or manipulation in my book if you are not a producer or consumer in the case of goods
3972856 according to a russian friend russian news is reporting that the conflict in the caucasus was instigated by georgia with material support in the form of weapons from the u s the motive was to benefit mccain by highlighting the need for foreign policy experience the fact that the attack took place while obama was on vacation resulting in footage of him elegantly relaxing while bombs exploded in an allied country lends some credence to this theory the friend also commented on the fact that the american educated president sakashvili conducts his press conferences in english
3972857 eine gewisse kommunikation wie etwa das online erledigen von beh rdenwegen die vereinbarung eines arzttermins oder das organisieren der kinderbetreuung muss immer gestattet sein
3972858 ich w rde es nicht empfehlen da es auf jeden fall als belastung f r das system gesehen werden kann nat rlich kommt es auch hier auf die betriebliche bung an aber auch wenn es nicht explizit verboten ist rate ich davon ab
3972859 wir raten arbeitnehmern im zusammenhang mit solchen verhaltenskodizes dazu keinerlei unterschriften zu leisten denn oft stellen diese regelungen die mitarbeiter schlechter als die rechtslage durch seine unterschrift akzeptiert der arbeitnehmer aber diese benachteiligenden regeln
3972860 i do not think this is the time to be holding onto foreclosed homes and hoping for a better day
3972861 current severities are rising much faster and in probability will be higher than the mid 1990s peak
3972862 in the last five months there has been a dramatic increase in sales which correlates to the decline in prices
3972863 in the lower price range many homes are getting multiple offers
3972864 investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation
3972865 the problems are not confined to large institutions that are overexposed to u s subprime loans
3972866 the problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over
3972867 we are skeptical that trying to bottom fish will prove profitable
3972868 history shows that the u s tends to lead the world into slowdowns and recessions
3972869 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3972870 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3972871 more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home
3972872 substantially mitigate the companys risk related to these transferred loans
3972873 their tangible book value is below 10 a share if they took the right markdowns
3972874 we like the guy whos running it its not his fault hes going to do the right things but the stocks not cheap enough
3972875 this rally weve had this huge rally seems to me pretty premature
3972876 dividend cuts are inevitable youre going to have to see them how can they pay out dividends if they have to raise capital
3972877 in the next six months lots of banks are going to raise capital and were going to probably put money into 5 or 10 of probably 50 or 100 well look at
3972878 if there are small banks who need to raise money our office doors are open
3972879 it just keeps spreading from one asset to another so its hard to know when these writedowns will stop
3972880 the u s economy needs to stabilize first but even then europe could lag and recover later theres still a lot more downside
3972881 its going to be like a long slow car crash to work through the housing situation
3972882 to continue to be weak for capital markets to remain under stress and for a continued decline in u s housing prices
3972883 this rally weve had this huge rally seems to me pretty premature
3972884 dividend cuts are inevitable youre going to have to see them how can they pay out dividends if they have to raise capital
3972885 theres still a lot of hair and a lot of dirt on these financials
3972886 this is something the average investor at home should be very careful about
3972887 creates the potential for heightened legal and business risk exposures for the purchasers or assignees of these loans
3972888 it will be a number of years before wall street starts paying taxes again
3972889 if the world banks prediction that the large investment banks will book up to 1 trillion in writedowns because of the mortgage crisis is true then mayor bloomberg is absolutely right
3972890 theyll try to use that as quickly as they can
3972891 if you add up all of the wall street losses youre talking about not paying taxes for five or six years easily
3972892 a lot of what were facing now are the diminished revenues from wall street with capital gains down 24 percent and personal bonuses down 20 percent and wall street losing 40 billion in its last three quarters
3972893 we still havent come to grips with how deep will be the impact on new york citys and the states economy and budget resulting from this credit crisis
3972894 weve already collected it but we cant spend it because its not ours
3972895 when the state government says they are going to cut back they are fundamentally going to shift that expense downstream to us so it is the mayors or county leaders in all 60 counties that are going to have to deal with where the revenue goes
3972896 i am preaching that it is likely to be difficult and trying and we have to work together
3972897 anybody who thinks that the state and the city are not going to have to look at all these kinds of things to face the new economic reality is just making a mistake
3972898 i am worried about the states bond rating and it will start to fall if the governor doesnt do something about his budget problems now
3972899 the rating agencies are cognizant of whats happening to our economy
3972900 we knew the mortgage securities market was tough in july
3972901 and we knew it was primarily alt a mortgages but this is the first confirmation of the magnitude
3972902 the separation of the divisions provides a basis for exercising strategic options
3972903 has signalled his receptiveness to taking advantage of such opportunities
3972904 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3972905 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3972906 the mortgage finance system in the united states has been badly damaged
3972907 there is definitely some reinvention that will need to occur and that will include some explicit involvement by the government
3972908 the bond vigilantes took law and order in their own hands and pushed yields up which would slow down the economy and bring down inflation
3972909 this time the bond credit vigilantes are refusing to go into the saloon and start drinking what wall streets financial engineers are mixing
3972910 it appears that every time we peel away this onion there is another layer
3972911 to the extent that home prices keep spiraling down the need for capital keeps increasing
3972912 but i am not sure it will solve all the problems
3972913 unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits
3972914 arrange beforehand to borrow the securities and deliver them at settlement
3972915 the economy will keep flying at a low level this year as demand weakens even from europe and asia
3972916 demand for new homes has weakened and we believe residential investment is unlikely to recover much further in coming quarters
3972917 were not in the kind of situation we were in at the end of previous expansions
3972918 with global commodity prices now tumbling this bad news is largely old news
3972919 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
3972920 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity
3972921 the national australia banks decision to write off 90 percent of its u s conduit loans will have dramatic repercussions around the world
3972922 wall street will be deeply shocked when they understand the repercussions of what nab has done
3972923 merrill lynch will provide financing to the purchaser for approximately 75 percent of the purchase price
3972924 to put it another way if there wasnt a loan attached to the sale its almost certain that the purchaser would have only agreed to purchase the assets for much much less than 0 22 on the dollar
3972925 u s banks have written down 450 billion in bad housing loans
3972926 the revelation from nab means that they will now certainly need to take provisions to 1 000 billion but write downs of 1 300 billion and perhaps even more are on the cards
3972927 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat
3972928 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment
3972929 the tone is clearly doveish with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so
3972930 i think with broadly flat output its bound to be the case that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3972931 the combination of these two shocks which have originated primarily in the rest of the world economy have meant that life is extremely difficult and will be for the uk economy over the next year
3972932 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months
3972933 it is only a matter of time before the resulting weakness in firms revenues results in more widespread job cuts
3972934 it is absolutely critical that earnings growth remains muted if the eventual next move in interest rates is to be down any sign that higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations are feeding through to push up pay significantly would add to already significant pressure on the bank of england to lift interest rates
3972935 im not sure the u s settlements will motivate banks to put more on the table they might and they might not
3972936 this has been one of the most difficult years we have ever had
3972937 its hard for people to imagine the toll that the frustration and stress had on myself and my husband
3972938 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3972939 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3972940 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3972941 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery this trend could run much further than many think
3972942 this is a major reassessment in a very short period of time the sentiment turned 180 degrees
3972943 the market now believes that the us economy once again will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly thats why we see the dollar rising like a phoenix
3972944 just a little softer than expectations but we like to look at these on a four quarter basis it for that it was darnn good
3972945 productivity is calculated by dividing output by the aggregate of hours worked in a specific period as such if employers are quick to lay off workers when activity slows productivity can still look solid even though the economy is sputtering
3972946 while these numbers are good theyre also fairly typical for the early stages of a recession
3972947 growth prospects in the eurozone japan and the uk have deteriorated most now accept that recession has already begun in all three
3972948 we think the emu credit bubble is about to burst
3972949 people who focus strictly on gdp would have missed a very big story in japan
3972950 much like the us japan had a credit crisis and a residential real estate crash early on yet the first back to back negative quarters of gross gdp didnt happen until the second half of 1993
3972951 waiting for gdp to go down is sometimes like waiting for godot a lot of action happens on the way
3972952 these numbers are going to be revised six ways to sunday
3972953 when i take a look at these four they all peaked and rolled over at different times from last october to february of this year
3972954 so when i do my homework i can see that the recession started i think in january
3972955 an oil shock a housing shock and a credit shock
3972956 housing is the quintessential leading indicator housing peaked in 1988 and then we had a credit crunch in 1989 and then the onset of a consumer recession in 1990 were just replaying an old movie
3972957 reflate the housing stock as an antidote to deflation in the tech markets in the early 2000s
3972958 this was like mary shelleys frankenstein they built the monster and then they had to tear it down
3972959 the path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom and i dont think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms i think that is quite a dangerous game to play
3972960 i think what separates my call say from the consensus is that i dont necessarily think this is going to be a mild flash in the pan i think this is going to be a long recession
3972961 this is an epic event were talking about the end of a 20 year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 2007
3972962 whether or not im right on the recession call ending theres going to be an extended period of economic weakness once it does as post bubble deleveragings are a multi year adjustment process
3972963 this is going to be a painful but necessary surgery so that we can get out of the hospital and embark on the next bull market of economic expansion
3972964 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there
3972965 american households own more than 4 trillion of consumer durable goods
3972966 were talking about the silverware the old antique couch in the basement unwanted or expensive art
3972967 peoples expectations have changed and so their behaviour is going to change dry cleaning was down upholstering was down beauty salons were flat its about getting out the old tool kit and doing it yourself
3972968 im not going so far as to say were going to live in a cave but life is going to change there are going to be some very hard decisions made over the household budget as to what to allocate to consumer discretionary spending
3972969 move from reallocating items on its balance sheet to aggressively expanding its balance sheet
3972970 usually 95pc of its balance sheet is in treasuries now its down to 50pc i think the feds approach is going to have to change
3972971 the bottom line is youve seen a significant turn in commodity prices
3972972 i am with the fed right now i feel pretty good about my statement that we expect inflation to moderate over time
3972973 the fed is making a bet inflation is going to take care of itself over the next six months
3972974 people have gotten very worried about demand for commodities because of this global meltdown
3972975 if all these major economies are going to slow down people think thats really bad news
3972976 crude was a safe haven at a time of a declining dollar and now the dollar is going back up so people are less interested in a haven
3972977 people understand that we might face a difficult two or three quarters ahead of us
3972978 when the dollar rallies as much as it has it reduces the investment in commodities including grains
3972979 people that bought in the past two days looking for improved demand at lower prices are getting beat up today
3972980 all those people who were bearish the dollar and bullish gold are getting their heads handed to them
3972981 the overriding theme of a weaker demand side is still prevailing
3972982 the fact that the fed is there supporting the financial system that in itself is helping the dollar
3972983 mbia agrees that statements may have violated new york state insurance law
3972984 it is as if we were not selling an insurance policy but selling mbias obligation to pay on the policy
3972985 when our spreads return to normal the value of this contingent liability would increase
3972986 without fas 157 our change in fair value would be nearly nil
3972987 the 961 benefit would have been a negative 1 3 billion as of july 31 if we had used july 31 spreads and pushed that back to the june 30 state of affairs
3972988 given all of the problems faced by monoline insurers today the resolution we achieved with aca may well serve as a model for other companies
3972989 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
3972990 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back
3972991 the cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace
3972992 they cant reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages
3972993 any time theres an additional imposition of fees in obtaining a mortgage it knocks some potential buyers out of the market
3972994 these are people who often rely on their good credit to buy investment properties putting little or no money down
3972995 they were created to provide liquidity in times of crisis
3972996 if they dont do that whats the point of having fannie and freddie in the first place
3972997 the banks are still at the mercy of writedowns i dont think the worst is over for financials yet
3972998 the feds current policy is to bail out the weak hands in banking and punish the savers in this country
3972999 but this is a band aid policy that is not addressing the real problem of inflation the fed should be trying to save the whole system not save the overextended and irresponsible
3973000 people will get their money and get it back in the immediate future
3973001 our leading position in supporting the market and providing liquidity is clear and now were the first firm to give all clients private corporate and institutional the opportunity to be made whole
3973002 there is a view that institutional clients ought to be sophisticated investors who knew what they were buying
3973003 i cant see why ubs would want to settle with institutional investors now that citigroup and merrill lynch have set the precedent
3973004 it would certainly be a concern as we did not expect them to repurchase all of those auction rate securities however it will also mean that the problem will be sorted out and the uncertainty wont drag on
3973005 i think that naturally any state that sees what new york state is getting and will have to spend money to refinance will do the same thing they will press for the same treatment
3973006 its hard for banks not to do the same thing
3973007 the industry is beginning to take responsibility for correcting a problem they created and thats a good thing
3973008 the fundamental goal has been to return money into the hands of investors and thats what this deal has done
3973009 there is no way for the institutions to win this fight and they know that
3973010 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market
3973011 once investors are out of their positions theyre less likely to sue and even more unlikely to prevail
3973012 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is in a state of total military aggression
3973013 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
3973014 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
3973015 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
3973016 in the markets conditions which many of us had already described as the worst in a generation took a turn for worse
3973017 one of the worst fannie mae has experienced on the debt and equity markets
3973018 neither of these companies have properly provisioned for what were heading into this thing is going to get worse and last longer and deeper than they originally thought
3973019 we have already undertaken a series of initiatives including raising more than 7bn in additional capital in the second quarter to help us manage through the most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
3973020 many of these guys did stated income loans where they overstated their incomes so theyre going to find it hard to refinance
3973021 you cant have a bottom in this cycle until you have credit
3973022 generally refers to a loan that can be underwritten with reduced or alternative documentation but that may also include other alternative product features
3973023 policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments and we have higher risk
3973024 by the end of 1972 there had been four straight sugar seasons with record crops yet consumption actually outpaced supplies in 1972 literally eating into sugar inventories over the next year
3973025 there was evidence that some big industry users were stockpiling sugar in anticipation of higher prices
3973026 everyone had a theory for the high prices sugar traders had no idea where prices might be when the uss long standing price supports expired at the end of 1974 some blamed the high prices on a scarcity of cheap labour to harvest sugarcane others pointed to the failure of the european sugar beet crop others even suspected that both the soviet union which had just suffered two bad production years in a row in its own sugar crop and arab oil money remember that oil crisis of the 1970s had moved into the sugar futures markets along with a rise in speculation by others looking to make money from rising prices
3973027 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy us government debt instruments so that they can earn interest on their money the debt instruments central banks acquire are held in custody for them at the federal reserve which reports this amount weekly on july 16 2008 the closest date of the weekly reports to the july 15th low in the dollar index the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth to put this phenomenally high growth rate into perspective for the twelve months ending this past july 16th assets in the federal reserves custody account grew by 17 3 which is less than one half the growth rate experienced over the past three weeks so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others so central banks pushed in one direction and funds and traders then stepped on board in other words central banks ignited the fuse of a bear market rally
3973028 i can once again ask the question i ask at tod why did those in a position to do something about it allow bush to remain in power
3973029 es una acci n pol tica y nada m s traer numerosos problemas a georgia pero no tendr efecto para los dem s miembros de la cei
3973030 hace tiempo que la cei se transform en una plaza de negociaciones para otras estructuras integracionistas como la comunidad econ mica eurasi tica o para desarrollar proyectos bilaterales
3973031 the fall in uk house prices has driven down the level of wealth tied up in uk housing by around 400bn representing a 9 per cent fall in the value of the uks housing stock
3973032 add to downward pressures on uk economic growth over the next year
3973033 the debt has increased our risk of being held hostage by foreign lenders
3973034 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time
3973035 the financial condition of the u s is worse than advertised
3973036 its inevitable there will be some tax increases on fat cats like myself
3973037 but any idea youre going to solve most of this problem with taxes is not realistic
3973038 arthur laffer said to me addison im not a debt guy
3973039 but that doesnt take into account everything thats coming down the pike
3973040 i live in a world where crisis management is the norm not the exception and you learn a few things
3973041 you learn never to underestimate the destructive power of negative feedback loops
3973042 policy change in washington d c has been too little too late
3973043 in a crisis like this leaders have to be much bolder
3973044 poor countries are recapitalizing the rich countries its a complete change
3973045 the downside risks swamp whatever the economys upside potential would be
3973046 whats it going to look like once that stimulus runs out
3973047 the profile that we think consumers are going to follow over the remainder of the year is one of lower spending
3973048 the rapid increases in the oil price that we saw earlier in the year are not likely to continue
3973049 the unemployment rate will probably drift upwards but if it doesnt accelerate the fed will probably feel like it can begin safely raising rates
3973050 it would be surprising if the fed did not raise short term interest rates
3973051 central bankers have to maintain their hawkish tone because they need to anchor inflation expectations but the reality is we are seeing a spell of weak data
3973052 we are probably getting close to the peak in inflation in the short term
3973053 the slowing economic environment which we are seeing in europe and in the u s will help moderate inflation
3973054 the biggest story in the bond market in the next six to 12 months is going to be a slowdown in global growth
3973055 therell be realization that the housing crisis led slowdown in the u s has led to a credit problem worldwide
3973056 i believe that the u s economy will go into deflation eventually its better to prefer conventional bonds rather than tips
3973057 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
3973058 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
3973059 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
3973060 we have got some serious issues that were dealing with in our economy
3973061 i believe its going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all the housing problems
3973062 the period of turmoil that were going through in our capital markets today is different from some of the periods weve had in the past in that the root cause took place right in the united states of america
3973063 long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favorably
3973064 lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3973065 the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances
3973066 look through the volatility in quarter on quarter growth rates and monthly indicators
3973067 never have we witnessed defendants who created a product that isnt inherently illegal being required to buy back such a large market
3973068 if the banks themselves are taking them back onto their balance sheets theyre not going to be slow to offload that liability
3973069 are going to be encouraged by the banks to find a way to close the books on these products
3973070 settle very soon perhaps in the next couple of weeks
3973071 the government has spent all the money on the games instead of putting money into the market
3973072 there has been no increase in capital coming into the market and large ipos have sucked up a lot of money
3973073 in the market for established homes more transactions are falling through
3973074 with some estate agents reporting a cancellation rate of up to 40
3973075 that was partly due to the unwillingness of many sellers to accept a lower offer
3973076 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame
3973077 1973 and 1989 were the peaks of two handsome fairly symmetrical housing bubbles in the uk
3973078 the uk is not iceland but a major player in the global banking business so the scale of the write downs will produce yet another wave of destabilization
3973079 in the end you have to be able to say do i really want to make this loan because i may have to eat it
3973080 they would say and fannie mae and freddie mac were part of it this is a complex global market if you start interfering with the free flow of money then georgia will become an island that has no credit i kept telling them youre in for a crash here
3973081 in the face of this horrible mess we still dont have firm clear regulations to protect consumers like prohibiting loans the borrower cant repay or gouging on price
3973082 freddie mac was up in albany working hard to gut the bills language this past spring
3973083 the new law empowers our regulator to crack down on us in many ways
3973084 we have one of the highest rates of foreclosure in the country
3973085 its not just the usual view on the health of the economy everyone expects to be told whether the credit crunch is over or not the politicians desperately want it to be positive but opinions are incredibly divided at the bank and elsewhere
3973086 this is not just about banks overstretching themselves with exotic products or even about people losing money it has a wider effect on society which in some ways could not have been predicted
3973087 was like a seizure we have had stock market black mondays but we have not really seen anything like the suddenness of this before
3973088 one thing you should probably know is that holland peaked in 1617 and life over there is still pretty good also
3973089 it is thus not impossible for the entire us banking system to implode
3973090 there can be no economic justification for the government guaranteeing the great majority of the nations home mortgages and the spurious government sponsored enterprise structure of fannie and freddie merely hides the likely consequences of their default
3973091 fannie and freddie do not represent the entire us finance sector far from it nevertheless their insolvency would further erode confidence in the rest of the sector very likely leading to a cascade of death spirals among other institutions after all the best run large non global us bank wachovia has itself got in trouble by its insanely foolish acquisition of the california mortgage lender golden west financial at the peak of the market in 2006 while bank of america the largest retail oriented us bank voluntarily took on more of the mess by its purchase of the diseased and probably criminal countrywide financial as recently as last january
3973092 thus a total collapse of the us financial system while not inevitable is a contingency which should now be planned for
3973093 the only way to find out is for investors to push every institution toward failure and see which ones keep operating
3973094 some of them werent on the fdic watch list i believe there are billions of dollars of assets on balance sheets that havent been written down yet
3973095 sometimes people who work at the bank dont know this level of detail
3973096 i always say get it in writing dont take their word for it
3973097 there really isnt as much distance between sir freds valuation and the price coming from the bidder
3973098 after their knight vinkes showing at the recent agm i doubt theyd have the gall to pop up again
3973099 theres a lot more to come the problems in the corporate economy are only just beginning to appear
3973100 profitability even in manufacturing was high in the service sector it was remarkable an all time high cash flows were very strong
3973101 companies had been rebuilding their balance sheets rather than spending on investment much to the prime ministers chagrin i thought that was quite a strong platform having said that when you look at some of the latest bank of england data there are some real weak spots companies are now in exactly the same kind of jam that consumers are in
3973102 in corporate we are not currently seeing material signs of tenant default but the deteriorating economic climate is likely to put some further pressure on impairments
3973103 lloyds has been the bank that has been telling everyone that nothing is as bad as it seems
3973104 when they came out with their results it became a little more difficult for them to argue that as the reporting season goes on we are going to see more bad debts more problems
3973105 we believe that corporate lending credit loss charges will once again prove the biggest variable in bank profits in an economic downturn
3973106 when we repeated the exercise a month ago the figures were completely reversed
3973107 there are now 70 of businesses telling us they expect their order books to decrease this year
3973108 people are not going to pubs but buying beer and staying at home they are denying themselves luxuries and spending more on necessities
3973109 we have had a primarily consumer led economy in britain for the past 10 years
3973110 every indicator tells you that consumers are feeling the pinch things are very bad out there
3973111 treasury secretary henry paulson delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround
3973112 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained
3973113 we will follow developments in the subprime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
3973114 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
3973115 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong
3973116 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
3973117 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3973118 we think the economy will contract outright in the second quarter
3973119 were in a recession it is going to widen its going to deepen
3973120 the cost of funds for private companies has ballooned even as short term rates and long bond yields have dropped
3973121 people really sat up and took notice it is the first time for months the ecb has begun to sound less hawkish
3973122 the risk of a sharp economic downturn or even a technical recession in the eurozone has become a worrying reality by now growth should be an alarming concern for the ecb
3973123 theres no way of knowing when its going to end
3973124 if they werent there wed be in a worse position theyve decided to come and help and ultimately they will reap the rewards of their investment
3973125 after the size of hboss failure the price of underwriting an issue will be impossible for others
3973126 there will now be pressure from central banks to take the big red pencil to dividends
3973127 i think were on the way into recession and well see mortgage losses greater than in the early 1990s
3973128 we see growth falling from 2 per cent this year to flat next year and companies will see their profits fall sharply and wont be able to borrow
3973129 unemployment is a lagging indicator and will take some time
3973130 we need to see asset prices stabilise and the reopening of the securitisation markets for banks but even then its going to take time to feed through to the consumer
3973131 how quickly we get out depends on whether the government puts in place a package to stimulate the economy and cut interest rates
3973132 if you look to the right you can see new york city
3973133 only 328 out of 79 929 loans are nonperforming at the end of the second quarter
3973134 we dont have wall street bundle up the mortgages and sell them to someone in norway
3973135 out of the 44 banks i work with hudson city is the one i really and truly love
3973136 they dont want to get involved in the condominium marketplace
3973137 the analyst from bear stearns who followed us got a new job the week after bear went down
3973138 if everybody thought the same way they would have married your grandmother
3973139 in particular it is illogical to raise taxes on capital when the basic problem we face is a lack of capital if anything taxes on capital should be further reduced to encourage accumulation of the capital needed to fund our growth as for income taxes it is time for americans to assess the wisdom of taxing the very thing we wish to generate if it is logical to tax cigarettes to discourage smoking what is the logic for taxing income a consumption tax coupled with repeal of the income tax would realign incentives toward a more rational economy based on thrift and savings rather than conspicuous consumption because we keep re electing the same politicians we have no one to blame but ourselves it is time to get angry
3973140 tax cigarettes to discourage smoking what is the logic for taxing income
3973141 because we keep re electing the same politicians we have no one to blame but ourselves
3973142 its evidence that they dont think the economy is going to recover quickly
3973143 as weve said before we have no plans to utilize the temporary authorities that has not changed this action should be interpreted as a prudent preparedness measure and nothing more
3973144 if you want that expertise youve got to deal with someone in the business i dont know how you get around it
3973145 morgan stanley periodically reassesses client property values and risk profiles
3973146 a segment of clients was recently notified of a change in the status of their home equity line of credit or heloc due to a change in the value of their property and or their credit profile
3973147 its evidence that they dont think the economy is going to recover quickly
3973148 the fact that theyre trying to get ahead of the problem is very good
3973149 all consumer lenders and home equity lenders are reassessing the environment given the pressure on housing and the economy
3973150 morgan stanley customers are typically coming out of their wealth management side so typically a high net worth customer
3973151 this shows you they are under the same pressures as everybody else
3973152 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices
3973153 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
3973154 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
3973155 the committee still expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year
3973156 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
3973157 this was hardly the first time since the bear market began in october that stocks have staged a strong rebound
3973158 i dont think this changes the situation in washington at all
3973159 regulators clearly knew freddie macs performance and how its been doing
3973160 home prices have declined and have hurt them as has the decrease in home sales
3973161 what you need for this stuff to work its way through is for homes to get through the foreclosure process and be sold
3973162 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
3973163 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
3973164 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
3973165 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a bit
3973166 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job
3973167 deal flows have slowed considerably and deals are taking longer to market
3973168 credit cards are the last resort for the consumer who can no longer use the value of his home to sustain spending
3973169 a very good loan for the borrower and the bank
3973170 the fear was that at the rate loans were paying off we were going to have to close the company down
3973171 but we were shocked by the magnitude of the lies
3973172 all you need is one case where the uninusured depositors the big deposits dont get covered and you have the potential that they start to run
3973173 to run an economy to have a function that works youve got to have a place where people can keep their money safely unfortunately the way the congress has structured it now thats not the case
3973174 youll notice that since the plan passed mortgage rates have actually risen in the country
3973175 we wont know for sometime whether ambac is going to be one of the long term survivors
3973176 the tumultuous credit markets continue to negatively impact the estimated impairment value of a few of our cdos
3973177 the benefit to ambac will come from reduced risk and improved rating agency capital cushions
3973178 fannie mae and freddie mac may have to do so as well
3973179 fannie maes and freddie macs combined share of mbs mortgage backed securities issuance rose substantially to 61 6 from 46 7 in 2006
3973180 increased their mbs issuance by nearly one third in 2007 as competition
3973181 have been scrambling to plug all the holes in their huge mortgage portfolios
3973182 started guaranteeing payments on loans that back mortgage securities held by others to delay recognizing losses on some delinquent loans
3973183 earlier this year in their most shocking desperate tactic to reduce losses fan and fred started making loans of up to 15 000 to people who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments
3973184 uk pension schemes of ftse 100 companies enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008
3973185 some companies chose to spend their surpluses on various forms of de risking activity including buy out purchasing financial swaps and reducing their exposure to equities
3973186 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
3973187 it is inevitable that employers will keep on closing schemes to both new and existing members especially in the face of so much uncertainty around funding and costs
3973188 public employees will become the pension elite for a while but cost pressures will burden future taxpayers too much and in years to come we as a nation will face greater problems with funding public sector pensions than the private sector is struggling with to fund its historic pension promises now
3973189 merrill sold 95 million in ars to 165 massachusetts investors in january and february even as executives knew the market could fail
3973190 he believes merrill is well positioned for the coming years because several of its businesses like wealth management do not depend on borrowing or leverage as the industry calls it
3973191 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
3973192 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
3973193 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto
3973194 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
3973195 what was the state supposed to do stop people building houses that wouldnt be reasonable tell the banks who they can lend money too we couldnt do that either we warned that building 800 000 homes a year was not sustainable and that granting mortgages for 40 years was folly but there are certain things the government cannot prohibit
3973196 it feels like im at the epicenter of the biggest financial crisis in history
3973197 where meredith cant opine or write anymore without moving stocks
3973198 youre going to have this stealth pressure on bank balance sheets until you start to see the ratio of downgrades to upgrades change
3973199 what do you do when your biggest tormentor keeps being right
3973200 you got to give it to her she figured it out
3973201 she was early she was right and she wasnt shy about saying it
3973202 whats ahead is much more severe than what weve seen so far
3973203 while my loss estimates are much more severe than those of my peers my biggest concern is that theyre way too low
3973204 federal home loan bank debt is not guaranteed by nor is it the obligation of the u s government
3973205 in light of the extraordinary events affecting the credit markets during the third quarter
3973206 what do you do when your biggest tormentor keeps being right
3973207 you got to give it to her she figured it out
3973208 but an actual question wouldnt there be people in the us treasury capable of
3973209 put simply if any given job cant be outsourced it cant be done this philosophy so central to the bush years explains statistics like this one in 2003 the u s government handed out 3 512 contracts to companies to perform domestic security functions from bomb detection to data mining in the 22 month period ending in august 2006 the homeland security department had issued more than 115 000 security related contracts it still looks like a government with impressive buildings presidential news briefings policy battles but pull back the curtain and there is nobody home
3973210 also if privatization is so good why is there no ongoing analysis of the costs and quality of service being delivered this is an administration that demands a cost benefit analysis of even the smallest government regulation of business yet it is throwing trillions of our tax dollars into the coffers of corporate contractors without monitoring whether the outsourcing is costing us more and producing less than if the work were done by government employees meanwhile as the number of contracts has skyrocketed the number of contract supervisors in federal agencies has remained the same which means that the supposed overseers cant keep an eye on the performance of the profiteers whenever agencies or members of congress do try to probe the corporations simply claim that their financial and performance records are proprietary while agencies are accountable to the public and subject to the freedom of information act corporate contractors are not even when its known in advance that a privatization project will be a rip off ideology has trumped integrity last fall for example congress rubberstamped a bush initiative requiring the irs to outsource the collection of certain taxes to three private debt collectors the collection agencies will pocket about 24 cents of every dollar they recover but if the irs were simply allowed to hire more revenue agents it could collect these same debts for only 3 cents of every dollar brought in over 10 years the three companies expect to reap 330 million from this deal
3973211 lawrence lessig a respected law professor from stanford university told an audience at this years fortunes brainstorm tech conference in half moon bay california that
3973212 if you send this forward to people and press your crushes name will apear on the screen
3973213 blast furnaces and ore at the carnegie illinois steel mills etna pennsylvania
3973214 it could be structured by cows and we would rate it
3973215 has consistently invested in resources and increased its professional staff across its business lines
3973216 we are meeting with your group this week to discuss adjusting criteria for rating cdos of real estate assets because of the ongoing threat of losing deals
3973217 our staffing issues of course make it difficult to deliver the value that justifies our fees
3973218 just too much work not enough people pressure from the company quite a bit of turnover and no coordination of the non deal stuff they want us and our staff to do
3973219 the only thing sure other than death and taxes is that deposit insurance premiums will be going up as more banks fail
3973220 business conditions remain weak and commercial loan demand is anemic
3973221 we now have three balance sheets all coming under pressure at the same time housing consumers and the financial sector
3973222 overall the pace of employment growth indicates the economy is settling into a troubling malaise
3973223 ford and general motors have announced further production cutbacks automakers are having difficulties securing credit to finance auto leases builders have a 10 month supply of unsold new homes and prices for existing homes fall month after month
3973224 what concerns me about the report is the number of different industries that are reporting job losses now
3973225 labor market weakness is starting to spread from one industry to the next and is going to accelerating in the coming months combined with the weak housing market the economy will continue limping through the rest of this year and into the next year
3973226 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
3973227 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
3973228 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
3973229 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
3973230 the panic of last year is over its more orderly now but the financial stresses remain and there will be more difficulties to come
3973231 the asset backed outstanding continues to creep a little lower
3973232 no one is willing to touch the asset backed commercial paper because people are concerned about the intrinsic value of the underlying issues mortgage related securities
3973233 the problems ubs was facing because of the writedowns caused by sub prime losses had damaged ubs reputation to the extent that a number of my clients were concerned about the safety of their funds
3973234 with the sub prime crisis exposure and the uncertainty of our exact losses we were given very little to defend our position in a very nervous environment clients and introducers were becoming very concerned about ubs
3973235 this legal action is to ensure that certain senior departing employees abide by contractual obligations
3973236 our strategy remains unchanged and ubs continues to be fully committed to offering all clients a personalised discretionary investment service
3973237 ubs categorically rejects any claim that the firm engaged in a widespread campaign to move inventory from the firms own books and into private client accounts
3973238 ubs told us theyd put the money in conservative investments to preserve our principal
3973239 we believe at the time the church made the investments the purchases were suitable
3973240 however as a result of unprecedented instability in the markets there recently have been numerous auction failures
3973241 we have encouraged our wealth management partners to mobilize troops internally so we can move more product through the system
3973242 this is our best and most effective way of hedging our exposure
3973243 i have to do a conference call with another client chief financial officer who wants to sell all his auction rate securities because his auditor pricewaterhousecoopers is telling him there are problems and to get out now
3973244 the entire book of securities needs to be restructured out of auctions
3973245 press your relationships within wealth management and cash management group harder now more than ever to do what we need to move this paper as well as current inventory
3973246 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
3973247 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
3973248 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
3973249 given recent events weve stepped up our public education efforts
3973250 kind of makes you wonder whats going on doesnt it
3973251 if this all goes bad i think its going to all go bad for everybody
3973252 it would have to be a moment in time a perfect storm coming together
3973253 the concern was i didnt know what was going on and it comes down to the hassle factor
3973254 if something were to happen thats going to be legal expenses to me because i dont know what to do
3973255 some municipal depositors discovered that oakwoods collateral securing their deposits was valued at significantly less than agreed while other depositors found that the bank had pledged the same collateral multiple times
3973256 if the bank would fail you have to track down the collateral
3973257 its all broken up to 100 000 or less so its all fdic insured
3973258 in the next several months or even the next year i would say the unfolding credit situation that customers are facing in dealerships will take center stage
3973259 a lot more creativity has to take place in the finance and insurance office to sell a car now
3973260 all the risk all the liability and all the expense is being put onto the consumer with this move away from leasing
3973261 there may be unintended consequences to this move and they may be unpleasantly surprised that consumers walk away and go someplace else
3973262 its a move that we have to make to reduce our risk in the marketplace
3973263 if the industry can see its way through this its going to give us much higher quality of sale and a much higher profit per vehicle
3973264 things are pretty bad and the river is getting deeper faster and wider
3973265 the question is can they get to other side before the cash runs out
3973266 this is almost like evolution and the survival of the fittest
3973267 they are on the right path to make fuel efficient cars but its going to take time
3973268 the reduction in commercial balances primarily reflects the credit policies of customers whose policies require them to deposit funds at aa rated institutions
3973269 risk that further shocks to the financial system could generate further adverse sentiment towards financial groups like a amp l
3973270 the board believes we are potentially vulnerable to risks of external events further eroding shareholder value
3973271 alliance amp leicesters underlying business is in good shape but our financial results have been significantly affected by treasury losses in the first four months of the year and by high funding costs
3973272 intensifying fears that moscow wants to use food exports as a diplomatic weapon
3973273 essentially it will be the latest in a series of industry renationalisations and a reversal of what till now has been one of russias privatisation success stories
3973274 i believe the shares of the state company will be managed jointly with private owners or they will be bought on market based conditions
3973275 would be bad for the entire development of the market
3973276 the power to bargain for higher wages a power that we assume was dismantled may not be so feeble
3973277 real wages adjusted for inflation are falling and there is no sign at all of any change in direction
3973278 that at some point they will have to be accommodated because they cant afford the rising costs of gasoline food utilities
3973279 and they cant resort to automatic cost of living adjustments or union power theyll find some other way through their demands on the political process and through their expectations
3973280 theres definitely a mindset change people are anticipating getting out of this doldrum and theres a lot of money on the sidelines people have gotten killed and they cant afford to miss the move
3973281 i agree that august is usually slow but i dont think its going to be slow this year
3973282 people have lost too much money they cant miss too many opportunities i think its going to be active
3973283 the political rhetoric that well hear out of the convention from the democratic side will harp a lot about whats gone wrong from higher oil to the weak us economy so thats not going to help us
3973284 from the republican side theyll try to talk about the successes in iraq and afghanistan from a defense standpoint im not sure thats positive theyll try to stay clear of the weak economy
3973285 youve got geopolitical action going on youve got oil issues going on youve got election things going on with all that activity youre going to get major swings
3973286 certainly the fact that volumes tend to be lower in august means volatility will be key
3973287 we invest for the long term so volatility gives us the opportunity to reduce risk and buy assets a little bit more cheaply
3973288 whats happening to people is theyre really starting to look at how all this stuff in the external world is affecting their internal world
3973289 this is the time for people to buy when so many people are running i still say that you should buy in a diversified portfolio the intention of more so looking at large cap focus
3973290 my feeling is as long as we continue to get some decent moves on earnings the market might surprise people when everyone thinks its going to go one way it usually goes the opposite
3973291 youre going to see us continue to bounce in these wild ranges
3973292 the banking system aims to make sure that the only losers are the customers it is supposed to serve debtors homeowners and employees of companies being
3973293 u s stock markets have been divorced from the realities of manufacturing and main street for years not going to change now so wall street will go back up starting in early october even as the economy gets worse for ordinary citizens that is a guess
3973294 this sh t didnt happen on its own accidentally they knew what they were doing still know what theyre doing
3973295 with the net and other sources of news and information i have notice that the truth gets out there in the publics gut eventually how they react will be the key
3973296 corporations have more rights than you in many ways taxing on net income just being one example theyve hijacked the radio spectrum and owning that channel they are now moving to take the hill that is the internet
3973297 with a space at the end and without the quotes at the start of every urdu paragraph if you want to write an urdu word s in an english paragraph do it like this
3973298 the global economy is going to grow at a sustained rate once this downturn is over
3973299 there will be transitional costs and the displacement of workers both blue collar and white in the advanced economies but im quite bullish about the state of the global economy and im positive about the medium and long term
3973300 youre going to have this stealth pressure on bank balance sheets until you start to see the ratio of downgrades to upgrades change
3973301 the consumers ability to refinance his way out of trouble has diminished greatly
3973302 citibank has lost 50 of its book value since last year
3973303 i do not think we are near the end of write downs
3973304 so i continue to see capital levels going lower capital raises diluting existing shares further and stocks going lower
3973305 as history has shown perhaps if a little more was done in the 1970s or even a lot more we may have avoided many of the issues that we faced for almost 20 years once inflation gets significantly out of control its extremely difficult to bring it back
3973306 we have seen job cuts increase in the majority of industries that we track
3973307 things are going to get much worse yet the situation in europe will follow the us
3973308 we are pleased with the completion of our credit facilities renewal and the continuing confidence in our company demonstrated by the banking community
3973309 pleased that the capital markets have responded so positively to the opportunity to renew the conduit credit facility although this annual renewal is an ordinary course event the unprecedented challenges currently in the capital markets make any such event more difficult
3973310 progress on this is probably one of if not the single most important economic process right now
3973311 with prices decreasing its better to get rid of houses quickly
3973312 where there are pockets of distressed real estate it does have an adverse effect on the surrounding properties
3973313 we want to treat that home as if it was your own or as if you were living next door to it
3973314 you wouldnt want that home to bring down your property value
3973315 two years ago i didnt have any fannie mae properties and now its probably pushing 50 percent of what i have listed
3973316 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
3973317 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
3973318 move much closer to the industry average in the coming months
3973319 policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments and where we have higher risk
3973320 there can be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession
3973321 this reinforces our belief that the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008
3973322 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation following this thursdays policy meeting
3973323 manufacturing confidence has tumbled over the past quarter the climb in oil and other raw material prices over recent months has driven costs up significantly although firms are having some success in passing these costs on profit margins are under pressure
3973324 the combination of falling employment confidence and rising inflation expectations is a lethal cocktail for consumer spending
3973325 that was a period of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
3973326 it was not knowing what to do its not being able to make a definitive decision one way or the other because i just couldnt tell you what was going to happen
3973327 its just incredible to me that this could happen to the fifth largest securities firm in the united states
3973328 the firm always had a good reputation ace greenberg was all about that he always said he would rather make 2 a day than risk losing more then this turkey
3973329 chose not to do that and put all his eggs in one basket
3973330 as prepared for this downturn as we possibly could be
3973331 and i think where the confusion arises is the fact that you cannot view monetary policy as a sort of simple issue if the most probable outcome is coming out of this soft patch into moderate growth with low inflation which i think is the most probable outcome that is not the same statement as saying that you therefore in the process of implementing monetary policy or formulating it i should say completely disregard what the upsides and downsides of a potential outcome may be
3973332 i think the data at this stage in the united states are not suggesting recession
3973333 were right on the brink and i would be more surprised if we didnt have a recession than if we did given the financial state
3973334 at this stage i think they are the major reason why in the very short term were fending off inflationary pressures
3973335 we will lose about 1 2 million yuan about pounds 90 000
3973336 lots of my clients used to visit to source their products directly a letter of recommendation from me was enough
3973337 the trade fairs are empty yiwu the worlds biggest wholesale market has seen sales drop 70 per cent to 80 per cent
3973338 uncertainties and destabilising factors in the international environment are increasing
3973339 as for the shutdown people knew and saw it coming the effect of the olympics on the overall chinese economy is zero
3973340 citibank has lost 50 of its book value since last year
3973341 discussions have progressed to the point that larger banks and dealers should have a central clearing house for credit derivatives by later this fall the market for credit derivatives is currently near 62 trillion in notional value any failure would then be absorbed by the clearing house members reducing the need for the federal reserve or treasury to get involved and possibly preventing the type of failure that was experienced with bear stearns
3973342 failure would then be absorbed by the clearing house members
3973343 when i began sending my book plunder investigating this calamity around to publishers there was a similar response even though the market meltdown had begin
3973344 i soon found that the denial and distraction i encountered in trying to distribute in debt we trust was also in vogue in the book publishing world
3973345 good think i invested in us dollars theres nothing fake about them
3973346 the essentially unregulated engines of credit expansion have increasingly been outside of the banking system in recent years so that central bankers have far less control over the process than one might think
3973347 in recent years off balance sheet vehicles abs cp conduits sivs cdos and hedge funds collectively known as the
3973348 there are already two busloads of fighters leaving for tskhinvali every day
3973349 they give you a uniform on the way and then you get issued with weapons once you arrive if i didnt have three children id have gone myself
3973350 our ossetian brothers are dying if we get the call every man who can stand on two legs will go to fight
3973351 a whole nation is under bombardment in the land it has occupied for hundreds of years the world must not ignore this aggression
3973352 our men will stay and fight until the last drop of blood but our old people and children must be saved we are calling on the kremlin to intervene and create a humanitarian corridor for them to escape
3973353 they are not involved in any way in this conflict between the russian military and the georgian military
3973354 we have upwards of 100 military trainers who are in georgia now weve been able to account for all of them
3973355 we have forces in georgia so obviously the secretary is interested in the situation there
3973356 what they do in a situation like this is contact the embassy contact our troops there assess the situation and begin to receive any information or request for support from the embassy or any reports about us citizens being in danger
3973357 at this point we are early in the hostilities the situation is sort of dynamic at this point
3973358 we are looking at the situation and how it develops its still early
3973359 the company does not maintain a tax basis balance sheet to support deferred tax accounting under gaap which could result in balance sheet misclassifications and potential income statement adjustments
3973360 in our view ambac is a company with a broken business model saddled with substantial liabilities and negative tangible equity
3973361 no one here thinks that these results are in any shape or form satisfactory it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 691m is something i and my colleagues regret very much this loss is a consequence of previously signalled writedowns on credit market exposures amounting to 5 9bn
3973362 the question with rbs and all other uk banks is the outlook for the uk economy and thats not good i think we have a lot more writedowns to come as the uk economy slips towards recession
3973363 it takes a brave person to try to predict the market by the end of the year but i feel a lot more confident about our markdowns than i did back in april business is getting done it doesnt feel like were heading back to the good old days but there is more movement
3973364 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword simply because removing the ceo sir fred goodwin
3973365 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
3973366 i think rbs is unique in one area in that they are very dependent on the investment banking industry whereas the other high street banks dont have that much of a reliance on it
3973367 we are focused on very difficult market conditions we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
3973368 we have steered it through good times and we are going to steer it through these times
3973369 i believe that citigroup should not have agreed to this arrangement and new york state should not have pressured the company to do so
3973370 impact on earnings will not be meaningful the need for more capital due to this event non existent
3973371 we have consistently worked with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all ars investors
3973372 its a start i suppose im glad they did it but i think for most investors its not the solution they need
3973373 its not satisfactory from our point of view in terms of the timelines of redemption therefore clearly well pursue our complaint
3973374 theyre all very critical elements of the settlement and i think the framework of what regulators are looking for the future as well
3973375 that has been a glaring issue in front of everybody
3973376 bank of america wants this off their back and its a lot easier to assess mortgage risk than litigation risk
3973377 very receptive to conversations about providing some relief and remedies
3973378 indicate a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies
3973379 the latest data for non oecd member economies tentatively point to expansion in china and brazil and a downturn in india and russia
3973380 is designed to provide early signals of turning points peaks and troughs between upswings and downswings in the growth cycle of economic activity
3973381 growth figures for mid 2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year
3973382 challenges and difficulties are growing for maintaining fast and stable economic growth due to rising international uncertainties and problems in the domestic economy
3973383 accept changes to market practices that in the past have generated sizeable revenues but at the cost of weakening the underlying foundation of the markets
3973384 namely in a competitive marketplace it is very difficult for one or a few institutions to hold the line on best practices much less for one or a few institutions to stand on the sidelines in the face of booming markets
3973385 the broker dealers that work are those that are part of a bigger conglomerate where theres a commercial bank like jpmorgan or citigroup and so on but all the other ones are fundamentally and structurally unstable
3973386 with a smile on their faces as to acknowledge the improbability of such a scenario management stated that the company would be interested in purchasing a bank only if it was able to use the acquired deposits as a funding source for any other part of the business and without additional regulatory scrutiny obviously current regulation makes that scenario impossible
3973387 this is definitely showing some level of spending activity on the part of the consumer following the fiscal stimulus bounce
3973388 the impact of the stimulus has put our problems off for tomorrow
3973389 rising fuel prices rising unemployment record low consumer confidence and most critically housing declines have made this economic cycle unlike any other
3973390 the wide ranging effects of the housing downturn are highlighted by the worsening of u s cards credit quality in axps affluent cardmember base
3973391 typically the affluent segment holds up well during downturns but home price declines have resulted in significant losses in consumer net worth lower home values
3973392 the sharp split between nondiscretionary and discretionary spending growth highlights reduced spending among consumers
3973393 we maintain our view of axp as the least worst of the group as the company does not have mortgage exposure has not lost money has not raised capital and we dont believe it needs to raise capital
3973394 axp credit and spend metrics appear to have been disproportionately hurt by declining home values geographic concentration and overall consumer stress
3973395 particularly within geographic markets in the united states that have experienced sharp home price declines
3973396 once you start raising the standards there will be that group of people that were on the borderline as far as underwriting criteria that may fall out
3973397 they are finding they are still able to grow their balance sheet and gain market share even with higher pricing
3973398 but my sense is that they are tiptoeing into it since they so unfamiliar with the lack of price competition
3973399 there is no amount of interest you can charge on a bad loan that will make up for it
3973400 foreclosures will remain at record highs the financial system will be under severe stress and the broader economy will sputter
3973401 the more conservative lenders were scaling back in 2007 but the more aggressive lenders were expanding
3973402 in some markets it suggests that prices will be flat in some declines
3973403 im more worried about 2009 than i am about 2008
3973404 i dont see anything on the horizon that will create an increase in prices or demand
3973405 weve had significant price skew caused by the closing activity at a number of high end buildings
3973406 this is a two tiered market the luxury market and the rest of the market
3973407 thats one of the reasons the new york market has remained so strong
3973408 thats not what the new york market is about anymore
3973409 the foreigners have done a good job of keeping the prices up
3973410 i do think credit and the amount that people can borrow will affect the middle market in new york city
3973411 2007 was a crazy year it was a spike upward 2008 looks like its going to return to normal
3973412 if we start to see massive layoffs that will start to affect average prices
3973413 well be watching what happens on wall street very carefully
3973414 try as we might to find them there was no silver lining to this report as all the details were bad
3973415 though the bank of canada has recently put greater emphasis on the risk of inflation pressures taking hold in the economy todays report will re establish the downside risks to growth as of equal concern
3973416 these offsetting risks will likely result in the central bank holding interest rates steady near term
3973417 the only significant gains were in accommodation and food services
3973418 canadas economy is clearly downshifting in response to the downturn in the u s and to the run up in the canadian dollar of relief to policymakers the slackening labour market is taking steam out of wages
3973419 employment in canada has for most of this year surprised on the upside though this was quickly reversed with this mornings numbers
3973420 todays report provides strong evidence that labour markets are starting to succumb to weakening gdp growth
3973421 are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the u s probably not
3973422 but its pretty clear that things are weakening and theyre going to continue weakening for some time
3973423 we never had that kind of credit excess in canada
3973424 i am worried right across the country that things are tightening up and that a year from now we are going to see a drop off
3973425 its quiet on the buyers side listings are up sales are down
3973426 people can go home and think about their bids overnight
3973427 last year they could hardly get back to their car to think about it
3973428 canadas housing market is entering a sustained downturn in our view
3973429 it does look like canadian houses finally got too expensive and builders too aggressive for the underlying demand environment
3973430 the take off in commodity prices since 2002 has driven an enormous improvement in canadas terms of trade accounting for much of the strong growth in canadian national income that has in turn provided the fundamental underpinning for the housing market boom
3973431 if households are uncertain about the duration of an improvement in the terms of trade then house prices will abruptly drop when the terms of trade stop improving
3973432 we knew that there were downside risks and those risks are materialising
3973433 they have cut out all reference to moderate ongoing growth and no longer seem sure that the economy will recover even in the fourth quarter i detect meaningful concern
3973434 the july rate rise looks like a policy mistake in need of being urgently reversed
3973435 theres not much left once you take out germanys staggering export growth each time theres a global shock european policy makers say that they are relatively immune and each time that turns out not be the case
3973436 the data has been dreadful but the ecb has surprised us before they are monetarists after all
3973437 it makes it much harder for the ecb to steer monetary policy in the single currency it should be stopped altogether
3973438 last night i had a piece of toast for dinner
3973439 the impact of this discharge on the environment and the population has been judged very weak
3973440 the housing bill has put forward the most explicit description yet of the true corporate model prevailing in america congressionally legislated businesses with central bank determined stock prices it is a fascinating combination of friendly fascism and multiple personality disorder now that the fundamental nature of the tapeworm corporation is out of the closet and clear keeping it afloat will require a mind numbing combination of global force to maintain financial liquidity and global propaganda and payola to preserve its brand
3973441 that culture is tolerated by the parties that these financial institutions have placed their bets with i e japan china because they have faith that all losses will eventually be paid by the us taxpayer
3973442 this is the most crucial region on the planet when it comes to energy
3973443 following from that do you have trouble with the canadian dollar falling with the drop in commodity prices to me it just looks like the other end of the same stick
3973444 in summary we find that economic changes include steady trends and unsteady occasional disturbances which act as starters for cyclical oscillations of innumerable kinds among the many occasional disturbances are new opportunities to invest especially because of new inventions these with other causes sometimes conspire to lead to a great volume of over indebtedness this in turn leads to attempts to liquidate these in turn lead unless counteracted by reflation to falling prices or a swelling dollar the dollar may swell faster than the number of dollars owed shrinks in that case liquidation does not really liquidate but actually aggravates the debts and the depression grows worse instead of better as indicated by all nine factors the ways out are either laissez faire bankruptcy or scientific medication reflation and reflation might just as well have been applied in the first place
3973445 due to low current credit enhancement levels relative to current pool projected losses
3973446 if that becomes widespread globalisation could reverse at awesome cost
3973447 once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions
3973448 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
3973449 assumes that current levels of demand for housing hold up
3973450 are predicting higher net charge off rates across the credit card industry
3973451 higher funding costs and higher credit costs flowing through the securitization trusts
3973452 lehmans caught between a rock and a hard place theyre getting more and more pressure from regulators and investors to add reserves or mark these things down
3973453 in normal times they could wait it out but the market wants it done now
3973454 we had negotiated a trade waiting until january certainly ran the risk to us that these assets continued to deteriorate in value and that they caused further losses
3973455 this is the first big trade in the cdo market
3973456 there really has been no liquidity until now theres no question this price was a bulk sale price
3973457 it puts us in a much better position to manage our business going forward
3973458 we are much smaller in terms of risky assets but its not zero
3973459 if asset values continue to fall particularly mortgage assets we still have some exposure
3973460 the u s economy is going to continue to be weak
3973461 if you look at the combination of falling home prices rising unemployment high energy prices both gasoline and however you heat your home and rising food prices all of those are going to make difficult for the consumer all of which i think makes the u s economy slow at least until sometime next year
3973462 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
3973463 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
3973464 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit
3973465 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
3973466 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
3973467 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
3973468 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
3973469 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
3973470 there is little to nothing that freddie mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring
3973471 youve got the worst housing crisis in u s recorded history and were the largest housing finance company in the country so when one goes down the other goes with it
3973472 were trying to solve a crisis of confidence would this do it
3973473 if they stop buying the agency debt then yields would increase
3973474 knows the markets hes seen parts of this movie before
3973475 send a message to the markets that it wasnt just a someday aspiration but those confidence building measures are in place right now before tokyo opens on sunday night
3973476 theyve increased credit loss expectations for the past three quarters and this next one is probably going to be the fourth
3973477 turbulent market conditions lie ahead would probably be an understatement
3973478 we see them continuing to lose money for the next several quarters
3973479 their credit losses are still going to be stubbornly high and thats only partially offset by the better revenues
3973480 the price would have to make up for the absence of strategic upside for allianz in other deals
3973481 you would have much lower synergies if you are a foreign bank looking at dresdner particularly in the retail bank
3973482 if a foreign company is prepared to pay a higher price it may be hard to block
3973483 maybe the people who are very very wealthy wont bat an eyelash but for the regular people who are working from paycheck to paycheck and week to week and dont have anything in the bank account this is devastating
3973484 speculation had been driving these markets and they were due for a correction as so many prices had gotten overdone
3973485 there are moderating growth expectations that are going to hurt industrial commodities going forward you have to be very selective
3973486 before you could look at commodities and buy across the board now you have to be much more nimble
3973487 people have that fear of not wanting to be the last one on the boat its abandon ship for the short term
3973488 there has been much more optimism about china and india and the export market than facts support
3973489 ive been at this for 22 years its about as bad as i have seen it in the fixed income market during that period what we have been seeing over the last eight weeks has been pretty extreme
3973490 we have armageddon in the fixed income markets we have armageddon
3973491 this has been a very deep and unusual crisis that involves the unwinding of a decade of excess
3973492 it is pretty clear that retail deposit taking institutions are in a stronger position i think the business model will change significantly and there will be fewer independent investment banks
3973493 stand alone investment banks will struggle to operate in anything like the way they were before the crisis
3973494 they are not going to be able to operate with the same degree of flexibility and leverage
3973495 investment banks have shown an amazing ability to reinvent themselves
3973496 investment banks should have a deep interest in making the fed comfortable they will not want it to escalate late launch emergency action in response to a funding crisis
3973497 a government back stop would reduce the risks of the business but it could also take away some of the profit potential
3973498 we are not going back to the days when banks made loans and kept them all on their books we have seen that movie and we know what happens in the end
3973499 the taxpayer and the government are paying more no matter what happens
3973500 larger auctions simply mean that each primary dealer probably has to buy and distribute more
3973501 and that could be an opportunity or that could be a giant giant headache
3973502 the auction process is really going to be dependent upon what is going on in the market at the time
3973503 the fed and the treasury will be nervous if the dealer community fell to too low of a number because somebodys got to underwrite more of this debt
3973504 its pretty obvious it would be good for the dealers if theres less competitors its more of a share of the pie for less people
3973505 the way energy prices and certain commodities have boomed many thought we would weather the downturn better
3973506 youve got a pessimistic look at the economy by the market its forced a lot of people to rethink that view
3973507 oil prices have come down quite a lot from their peak but the canadian dollar still hasnt moved at all the currency should also weaken due to the weaker economic data
3973508 from a technical and fundamental perspective we are looking for the canadian dollar to weaken
3973509 commodities are still a positive story as the strategic direction is upward
3973510 the canadian dollar is underpinned from this point of view
3973511 canadas own sluggish domestic fundamentals suggest their interest rate cycle will lag
3973512 like many good stories as the canadian dollar had been it is over we are targeting a retracement back to more comfortable levels at c 1 14 per u s dollar if not higher into end 2008
3973513 will take a back seat to another catalyst the end of the oil rally
3973514 the exchange rate will push higher as the rally in oil prices reverses
3973515 there are some expenses in these times that need a closer look
3973516 everything that has any economic impact in the contract was received in lieu of pay
3973517 none of us were talking about a recession in the economy until three to four months ago
3973518 thats where theres quite a rout going through at the moment
3973519 if you give hives a thump you get a little roar coming back and i didnt get any roars
3973520 some had bees but the mysterious ones had virtually nothing everything had disappeared
3973521 we have all the components here of the american style disorder in terms of disease
3973522 probably these sorts of losses havent been seen since the early 1900s there is clearly something taking place over and above the normal vicissitudes of beekeeping
3973523 because bees pollinate a third of everything that we eat most fruits and nuts vegetables and seeds the plants we use for cattle feed wed end up with a food shortage and very high prices
3973524 in the sum of the whole of the agriculture business its a drop in the ocean
3973525 theres insufficient allocation for research and bees are so fundamental to our environment
3973526 what is most important is that we have a clear understanding of disease threats and how to tackle them
3973527 that is why we are developing a bee health strategy which will set out the objectives and priorities for the bee health program over the next 10 years
3973528 the bee health strategy is proving to be a delaying tactic
3973529 its a fig leaf for not spending the money thats really needed
3973530 this years probably the biggest business year that weve ever had
3973531 thats in terms of demand for bees and the amount of people who want to re queen their colonies
3973532 the bees are not behaving as they normally do something has upset them
3973533 lots of people have lost queens they havent mated properly or theyve gone off laying all weird things that are difficult to explain
3973534 energy availability is going to be an issue sooner than 5 years imo
3973535 eventually i will not be able to afford to purchase electricity with my cash or there will not be any electricity
3973536 if you have all the major industrial central banks in the world lowering interest rates while simultaneously the fed is hawkishly about to raise rates that in itself will perpetuate the flow of money funds will flow into the u s and out of the rest of the world that forces the central banks around the world to continue to lower interest rates chasing the flow down
3973537 the same basic reasoning applies to currency valuations raising interest rates makes the currency stronger which brings more investment which makes the economy stronger which engenders higher rates ad nauseum
3973538 they didnt raise rates because the it would kill the economy
3973539 he kurtz and his men were playing hit and run all the way into cambodia
3973540 fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3973541 open an investigation into the circumstances that precipitated the recent distress in the shares prices of freddie mac
3973542 relating to any actual or rumored disclosure or communication by a white house official to investors the media or board members of a plan to nationalize place in conservatorship or assume control of freddie mac
3973543 its been clear that what we have been focused on is shoring up fannie mae and freddie mac and instilling confidence in them and thats all
3973544 the administrations proposal says these deals should only be permitted when the acquiring entity has a higher credit rating than the seller
3973545 such a transaction creates greater security for retirees and the pension system
3973546 we have identified several clients who would be willing to be first to sell a plan
3973547 but the question is when is a good time for this
3973548 in the wake of the subprime crisis it would be crazy to allow financial institutions to manage these plans
3973549 while there are legitimate regulatory and policy considerations much of the criticism is misplaced
3973550 this is really in the public interest if its done correctly
3973551 as were all painfully aware the housing correction has had a significant impact on the us economy
3973552 in the midst of the single largest decline in real estate values since the great depression
3973553 todays challenging economic environment suggests the housing market is far from stabilising we now think were about halfway through the peak to trough decline
3973554 while we do not expect to draw on any of the new backstops going forward they provide important sources of reassurance and potential support in the event that the housing market declines even further than anticipated
3973555 what will be interesting to see are the terms investors will demand in return for buying into freddie macs proposed 5 5bn stock offering
3973556 people are coming into the system that probably would not have filed absent
3973557 you may have projects on the cusp that are going to be difficult to do
3973558 the unwinding of the credit bubble has had dramatic implications
3973559 we recognized that some unprecedented things had occurred in the market but of course it doesnt feel good to pay 15 percent
3973560 nothing has stabilized and rates have just been going up
3973561 this is the same cycle and profile and story the other guys went through before they lost their rating
3973562 when this started happening last august people thought the sky was falling and knock on wood we were able to get through it and repair all our debt maybe this time it may be more difficult because if you have no bond insurance whats the market going to do
3973563 the global default rate will climb sharply over the next 12 months
3973564 the pace of corporate defaults increased considerably in july as economic conditions weakened and more companies experienced financial distress
3973565 if they raised 100 billion maybe id take a look
3973566 the sharp decline in the housing market and volatility in financial markets continue to adversely affect our capital
3973567 including our ability to manage to our regulatory capital requirements and the 20 mandatory target capital surplus
3973568 this action should be interpreted as a prudent preparedness measure and nothing more
3973569 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
3973570 needs to raise capital today not wait and hope for a chance to raise cheaper capital in the future
3973571 we continue to estimate that freddie mac needs to raise 10 billion to 15 billion
3973572 either investors are going to be massively diluted given the amount of equity they are going to need or they are going to be nationalized
3973573 without a larger equity capital base they are going to be incapable of surviving we dont think 5 5 billion even scratches the surface
3973574 by the end of the third quarter the preferred stock in fannie and freddie will be issued the treasury will have bought it
3973575 well be on our way toward a joint treasury agency combination
3973576 i think hes an extraordinarily talented manager particularly on the fixed income side but based on the information i have now i do not believe that the treasury will end up having to inject money into freddie mac
3973577 if theyre unable to tap the markets to raise capital were talking a matter of quarters before the government has to step in
3973578 the company is defiant that all they are going to need is 5 5 billion in capital and the street is not going to accept that
3973579 are they waiting for better times its just going to get worse over the next six months
3973580 i dont see how they can raise capital by themselves without a capital infusion from treasury
3973581 we have every right to defend ourselves and advocate for our positions particularly since we play such a critical role in housing finance
3973582 to communicate our views and concerns in order to advance homeownership and affordable housing in america
3973583 all sen demint is asking is for fannie and freddie to play by the same rules as other federal entities
3973584 as long as they have shareholders and theyre publicly traded companies they should have a right to representation
3973585 what were seeing here is just the tip of the iceberg
3973586 from citigroups perspective its good to try to get this resolved instead of it being drawn out through litigation
3973587 we have consistently worked with and are engaged in active dialogue with all our regulators
3973588 the sec will take into consideration what is good for the country overall
3973589 the purpose is to stop the bleeding and stop the unraveling of our financial system
3973590 some liquidity returned to the market with a number of auctions being completed
3973591 could force the hand of other banks to do something similar
3973592 were obviously working as hard as we can and we hope it will reach a resolution real soon in order to get investors their money back
3973593 firms that dont settle are going to be frowned upon by investors
3973594 we are committed to continuing the many initiatives that we believe will provide liquidity to our auction rate clients
3973595 will depend on the market value at that time and the amount of securities purchased
3973596 our second quarter results were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment these results do not reflect the earnings power and potential of aigs businesses and it is clear that we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be
3973597 virtually everybody was frankly slow in recognizing that we were on the cusp of a really draconian crisis
3973598 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
3973599 since roughly march weve kind of been bumping along the bottom
3973600 thats likely to continue for at least some period in the future
3973601 most challenging financial crisis in the entire post war period
3973602 central banks are the only institutions of public policy that literally operate in financial markets every day of the week
3973603 if that doesnt give you some kind of advantage i dont know what does
3973604 countrywide conned customers into loans that were clearly unaffordable and unsustainable turning the american dream of homeownership into a nightmare
3973605 edf will have to make up the shortfall somehow they may have to look to customers in countries where the markets are less interventionist like britain
3973606 energy prices are not like the price of baked beans
3973607 it matters if people cannot afford to pay so leaving it all to the market is just not acceptable
3973608 although i take some comfort from our relative performance in managing our risks and in generating income a decline in profit of 33 is acutely disappointing and i add to that my disappointment at the decline in our share price our shareholders have had to endure a lot
3973609 companies that would have refinanced a year ago find now that they cant
3973610 were only now starting to see a serious impact from the crisis in the euro zone economy
3973611 its only a matter of time before larger companies feel the impact of squeezed credit conditions
3973612 theres a strong link between the feel good factor of a healthy housing market and consumer confidence
3973613 were hiring new people and the staff are all working longer hours
3973614 the combined effects of these shocks raised uncertainty increased inflation risks and compounded the ongoing correction in the domestic housing market
3973615 a run on northern rock raised the spectre of financial stability weakness feeding through to the real sector
3973616 so far in 2008 evidence points to a sharp slowing in activity alongside high inflation
3973617 second quarter growth was weak forward looking indicators are gloomy sterling money market spreads remain elevated unemployment has edged up and house prices are falling rapidly
3973618 gordon browns economic incompetence is now famous around the world his fiscal rules are in tatters inflation is forecast to remain above target and his system for bank regulation failed its first serious test the imf report is a damning judgment on almost every aspect of his legacy as chancellor
3973619 given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy imf directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present
3973620 underpinned this remarkable performance will be tested by lower growth higher inflation from food and fuel price increases ongoing strains in financial markets rapid house price reversals and medium term external imbalances the financial sector strains have also triggered a broad based effort to reform the financial stability framework
3973621 it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
3973622 it seems unlikely that the bank of england will cut interest rates in the near term at least indeed it is possible that the bank of englands next move could be to raise interest rates which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
3973623 very negative housing market sentiment also heightens the risk that house prices will fall sharply over the next couple of years
3973624 there can therefore be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession indeed the construction sector looks to be in for an extended very difficult time
3973625 this reinforces our belief that the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008 even allowing for the fact that the construction sectors share of national output is relatively limited at some 6 per cent
3973626 people will look back at the last decade as the halcyon days of cheap mortgages
3973627 the mortgage market is about to undergo a fundamental shift
3973628 i dont think the markets here will ever return to the way they were easy credit is not necessarily good for either consumers or the economy in the long term
3973629 by 2006 such funding equated to around two thirds of net new mortgage lending
3973630 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget
3973631 until the legislature passes a budget that i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
3973632 but we do not have the luxury of stretching out this process any longer
3973633 they shouldnt be paid and they should never get that money back
3973634 my fear is that simply creates another tension between the administration and the legislature that is really unnecessary
3973635 many of the bills the legislature passes do california more harm than good
3973636 in light of our cash flow improvements i respectfully urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
3973637 i am asking each of you to step up your efforts to increase savings i ask that you be creative and take action now
3973638 the high price of energy is hurting our businesses and our families anything we can do to reduce fuel consumption will ease the burden on our budget and on taxpayers
3973639 the governor is clear that we not do anything to impact public service or public safety
3973640 im glad that governor gregoire has started to recognize the budget crisis shes created she had to know that by increasing spending 33 percent in her first term she was heading the state toward a budget deficit
3973641 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year
3973642 judging by her frequent use of the rhetoric the governor apparently believes this is a winning message but something tells me its not going to gain much traction with voters who are worried about their economic future
3973643 todays decision was a prudent necessary step to ensure that inflationary expectations remain under control
3973644 it will be a one shot increase policy focus will start to move away from inflation towards growth concerns later this year
3973645 we need to place priority in stabilizing the ordinary peoples lives and creating more jobs
3973646 todays decision is likely to do more harm than good
3973647 economic growth already looks set to decelerate sharply over the second half of the year
3973648 the weakening won has been adding more import price pressure and todays rate increase should help ease that
3973649 the pace of intervention in itself was clearly unsustainable over the long term given the boks limited reserve pool
3973650 the hike in the base rate should therefore be interpreted as a complement to the authorities policy of supporting the exchange rate
3973651 this time last year the talk was of india decoupling from the troubles of the rest of the world economy now its clear that india has its own problems it has gone from hero to zero
3973652 just as many forecasters and markets were too optimistic in 2005 07 effectively running with the view that whatever china could do india could do better there are now some that are suggesting that it can do nothing right
3973653 many clients have often regarded this projection as a fact
3973654 given the inflation challenge the fiscal and current account position one might say oil prices are the most critical thing for india in the next six months or so
3973655 as ever in india there will be plenty of messiness along the way
3973656 andrew cuomo the youngest housing and urban development secretary in history made a series of decisions between 1997 and 2001 that gave birth to the countrys current crisis
3973657 the system is going through a last round of tests the players feel pretty secure that its leak proof but they want to be certain
3973658 after admitting their cluelessness they make the stunning declaration that they in effect should be self regulating and their self regulation will actually be more stringent than if they were regulated from without
3973659 it is said go not to the elves for advice for they will say both no and yes
3973660 even from the wise to the wise advice is a perilous thing
3973661 det r samma sak som om din son r med i ett fotbollslag och pl tsligt blir utbytt av tr naren
3973662 drought refugee from polk missouri awaiting the opening of orange picking season at porterville california
3973663 this is the most important piece of housing legislation in a generation
3973664 i am disappointed that we couldnt do better im even more disappointed that the white house will sign this
3973665 theres no other person in the administration with the experience and influence paulson has in these matters
3973666 there was a political necessity to be seen as doing something regardless of ideology
3973667 the legislation will give the new regulator the tools necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of the gses so they fulfill their mission of providing stability liquidity and affordability to the mortgage market
3973668 this is about not only our housing markets but its about our capital markets more broadly
3973669 we are at a time of considerable turmoil in the private financial markets and that is a traditional time when government support is needed and called upon
3973670 this is the most important piece of housing legislation in a generation
3973671 i hope they will be able to take advantage of it right away
3973672 the commission should be given a statutory mandate to perform this function at the holding company level along with the authority to require compliance
3973673 lending money to investment banks they can do a great deal
3973674 its up to cox to make sure that great deal doesnt run over the sec
3973675 we need to adopt an integrated approach to the design and enforcement of capital standards and other prudential regulations critical to systemic stability
3973676 strong supervisory authority is required over the consolidated financial entities that are critical to a well functioning financial system
3973677 the risk is that the culture of safety and soundness which is the bank culture will trump the culture of investor protection
3973678 would fundamentally alter the role that investment banks play in the capital formation that has fueled economic growth and innovation domestically and abroad
3973679 there are going to be builders who argue that the lender forced me into insolvency by not acting in good faith
3973680 in our view the bank took a healthy project and destroyed it
3973681 its our belief that they had no legal grounds and no legitimate practical concerns for refusing to continue funding it
3973682 aggressively reduce its exposure to the residential properties segment of its commercial real estate construction loan portfolio
3973683 when the project didnt work the developer would blame the bank when the bank moved to foreclose
3973684 the banks learned their lesson in the 1990s thats why lenders are cautious today
3973685 i told them your appraisal is flawed this bank is in trouble and it just wants out
3973686 the fdic is currently reviewing all defense of litigation that was pending against indymac when it was closed
3973687 if banks want to get out of residential lending thats fine lets sit down and figure it out
3973688 but that isnt being done the rug is literally being pulled from under us and games are being played
3973689 after seven months this country boy figured they werent going to allow us to use the credit line i said no functioning line no interest
3973690 a recent online survey of realtors shows nearly a quarter of potential homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines
3973691 about four in 10 homes are purchased by first time buyers which frees existing owners to trade up
3973692 not only is ubs guilty of committing a flagrant breach of trust between the bank and its customers its top executives jumped ship as soon the securities market started to collapse leaving thousands of customers holding the bag
3973693 categorically rejects any claim that the firm engaged in a widespread campaign
3973694 while ubs does not believe that there was illegal conduct by any employee we have found cases of poor judgment by certain individuals and are evaluating appropriate disciplinary measures for these individuals
3973695 the most changes have come about in prices being paid by consumers and by businesses
3973696 was reported as mixed weak or slowing in nearly all districts
3973697 were the only source of cash and now we have to worry about a weakening job market falling housing values
3973698 the underlying picture is one of a labor market that is weak
3973699 the economy is growing slowly so you tend to see job losses rising the weakness could increase further in coming months
3973700 every number was close but every number was on the wrong side on the negative side
3973701 the 8 billion charge was quite a bit of a surprise
3973702 both are in very serious shape and the markets reflect that
3973703 the thing that triggers a default in almost all cases is running out of cash and not being able to refinance
3973704 youre not going to go bankrupt as long as you can refinance short term liabilities you will go bankrupt if you cant
3973705 progress on this is probably one of if not the single most important economic process right now
3973706 with prices decreasing its better to get rid of houses quickly
3973707 where there are pockets of distressed real estate it does have an adverse effect on the surrounding properties
3973708 we want to treat that home as if it was your own or as if you were living next door to it
3973709 you wouldnt want that home to bring down your property value
3973710 what you need to know here is that the right the wsj editorial page heritage etc hates hates hates fannie and freddie why because they dont want quasi public entities competing with angelo mozilo
3973711 taxpayers are on the hook this is incorrect the agencies debt is not guaranteed by the u s treasury or any agency of the federal government
3973712 i think gray is far more accurate than your editorial writer your subscribers deserve better
3973713 because the legislature has failed to pass a budget and our state does not have a rainy day fund this is one of a number of options we are considering to make sure we have sufficient cash to cover our costs
3973714 the governor is turning a budget crisis into a catastrophe
3973715 how can you tell people we will just pay you this amount and you can catch up later
3973716 we are in the middle of a housing crisis and people are losing their mortgages
3973717 are they going to issue a notice to mortgage companies that employees will just catch up later
3973718 in the market for established homes more transactions were falling through with some estate agents reporting a cancellation rate of up to 40 per cent recently that was partly due to the unwillingness of many sellers to accept a lower offer
3973719 the credit crunch has buried any chances most first time buyers might have had of getting on the property ladder but for landlords this is a cloud with a gold plated lining
3973720 our banking system is a safe and a sound one

3973722 how the hell can countrywide add to bank of america earnings
3973723 cibc denies these allegations and plans to vigorously defend this action cibc is confident that at all times its conduct was appropriate and that its disclosure met applicable requirements
3973724 my sense is that cibc went very very deep into this market
3973725 the essence of our claim is that they failed to disclose the magnitude and troubling risk profile of these investments
3973726 were seeing an awful lot of large institutions suing banks
3973727 throughout the class period cibc continuously failed to disclose the true materially impaired value of its mark to market assessments of u s subprime residential mortgage investments with the result that it overvalued its assets in the financial statements and failed to issue earnings warnings when they were warranted
3973728 no current intention of making an offer for moneysupermarket com
3973729 now of course they are facing another kind of problem which is the cyclical slowdown at home it is possible that real estate prices could fall in absolute terms and that presents challenges for santander
3973730 it is possible that real estate prices could fall in absolute terms
3973731 they santander and bbva have some very good franchises in south america and they have a decent business in spain though spanish housebuilders are going through a terrible recession they seem to have not stepped on landmines both in terms of spanish real estate and us sub prime that is why they are confident
3973732 if you dont fully understand an instrument dont buy it if you would not buy a specific product for yourself dont try to sell it if you do not know your customers very well dont lend them any money if you do these three things you will be a better banker my son
3973733 santander take great pride in the way that they have come out of the credit crunch and they are right to feel proud the main reason for that is their legacy as a retail bank and the bank of spains rules were more prudent than for other countries
3973734 now of course they are facing another kind of problem which is the cyclical slowdown at home it is possible that real estate prices could fall in absolute terms and that presents challenges for santander
3973735 latin america has been one of the positives of these two banks but this is going to change this year because the macro economy is not as positive as it used to be
3973736 it may be premature to talk about recession in europe but the data does raise the risks
3973737 the abrupt falls recorded in the national business confidence indicators confirm that no country is immune to the slowdown
3973738 with just a bit of bad luck any further monetary tightening could possibly push the euro zone into a brief recession
3973739 if the us government would want to create domestic inflation it would need to pump in a minimum of 6 trillion by now the total that has gone they dont and so theres no inflation there are merely higher prices for a few items
3973740 when the shtf for real who is going to worry about paying a credit card
3973741 john stewart and michael chaneys decision to go straight to 90 per cent provisioning on national australia banks portfolio of us residential mortgage backed securities rmbs is a shocking event that will reverberate around the world
3973742 popular culture is the breaker of customs prejudice tradition and relevant historical knowledge
3973743 if you are planning to vote in the 2008 presidential election what is your need to engage with that system how is it that you believe you have a valid authentic choice between two divergent political and philosophical positions what keeps you tethered to the charade its not important that i know your answer but very important that you do
3973744 the national australia banks decision to write off 90 per cent of its us conduit loans will have dramatic repercussions around the world
3973745 the nab chief and his team seemed surprised that what they thought was an ultra cautious stance effectively valuing their cdo exposures at almost nil had provoked such criticism it was it seemed the right idea badly handled
3973746 last night ratings agency standard amp poors put the nab on negative credit watch warning the banks aa rating was at risk if nabs credit costs blew out or investors deserted the bank
3973747 the worst case scenario might not be too far away from the most likely scenario
3973748 if you wouldnt invest in aaa assets then you wouldnt invest in any company in australia
3973749 we have a very low appetite for acquisitions at the moment
3973750 right now we believe we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3973751 selling off the portfolio at levels below marks creates initial losses but relieves future uncertainty
3973752 the capital raise if ultimately successful could indicate private capital raising ability more broadly for financials proving access to raising equity capital would be a clear positive for financial credit spreads though not necessarily for stock prices
3973753 suggests that the true value of the assets is quite a bit less
3973754 until the true value and the mark to model converge its going to be difficult for investors to have confidence in anything wall street management says
3973755 if others were to follow such a playbook writedowns on cdo positions could be larger than taken to date with the offset of reduced uncertainty going forward for broker and bank spreads and tightening spread implications for monolines considering their current distressed levels
3973756 since august 2006 there has not been one month where we have seen overall price increases as measured by the two composites
3973757 what i look at is the census bureaus inventory of vacant homes on the market that hasnt budged much although it dropped to 2 8 of total homes for sale in the second quarter from 2 9
3973758 whats worrying me is that foreclosures are adding to inventory and the inventory numbers tell you what to expect for the next couple of years
3973759 it does mark an attempt at curing the problem but at a tremendous cost to existing shareholders
3973760 how can you be pleased by that its a necessity
3973761 while third quarter results and the future capital raise would be yet another burden we do believe there is light at the end of the tunnel
3973762 our consistent focus has been to opportunistically reduce risk and in order to take advantage of this sizeable sale on an accelerated basis we have decided to further enhance our capital position
3973763 why these assets are written down when youre selling them and werent written down in your earnings is a question
3973764 this kind of announcement is surprising and a little disheartening
3973765 the sale of the substantial majority of our cdo positions represents a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
3973766 we could have raised substantially more money we turned people away
3973767 we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3973768 we think they have taken care of much of their troublesome exposure in structured finance and real estate
3973769 one of my first priorities at merrill lynch was to strengthen the firms balance sheet and today we have made great progress towards that by bolstering our capital position through these investments and our announced sale of merrill lynch capital
3973770 were very confident that we have the capital base now that we need to go forward in 2008
3973771 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
3973772 we have more capital than we need so we can say to the market that we dont need more injections we can confirm that we have tackled the problem
3973773 in 2007 we lost 8 6 billion dollars after tax but we raised 12 8 billion dollars in new capital we raised significantly more capital than we lost and we did that on purpose so that we could say to the marketplace that we raised more than enough capital we replaced all the capital we lost we have plenty of capital going forward and we dont need to come back into the equity market the goal is to maintain our current ratings no more capital raising im sure we have enough capital
3973774 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
3973775 john thain has been very clear that we have sufficient capital and dont have a need to raise additional common equity for the foreseeable future when we raised this capital in january we had a lot of demand so we went beyond what we needed
3973776 today on a pro forma basis we have about 44 billion of equity capital which actually isnt very much below the all time high that merrill ever had and our philosophy about this is that we are well capitalized were comfortable with our capital position we like everyone else are deleveraging our balance sheet
3973777 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3973778 right now we believe we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3973779 that is not being written down even as the shareholders are having their positions massively corrupted
3973780 if there is a crime on wall street it is this
3973781 in a six day short covering rally that was interrupted by a 6 7 drop last thursday the biggest decline since a 7 7 decline on april 14 2000
3973782 the financials tend to rally following massive government programs to avert a financial meltdown
3973783 that does not sound very good for the about to be diluted shareholders now does it
3973784 we learned a lot of good lessons from the investment in merrill lynch
3973785 temaseks point of view is that this opportunity is not going to be repeated
3973786 from a long term investors point of view getting access to the u s financials market is best done through strategic stakes
3973787 temasek confirms its commitment of 3 4 billion in the public offering by merrill lynch a portion of which is subject to regulatory approval
3973788 the commitment includes a sum of 2 5 billion arising from a re set payment
3973789 merrill needs big strong investors and it will be good for sentiment these are the guys who are unlikely to bail out at the first sign of trouble
3973790 at the end of the day we are unlikely to see the merrills of this world collapse that will cause the depression of the 21st century
3973791 what has become increasingly clear over the past year is the longer you wait the less the soured assets are worth
3973792 the good news is that that the actual sales can give confidence that merrill is finally selling assets rather than merely marking them to market
3973793 while we dont think merrills announcement necessarily implies a 40 percent writedown 7 2 billion for citi directionally we think investors should expect further incremental writedowns in coming quarters
3973794 we anticipate that it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets
3973795 if future events differ from current forecasts a valuation allowance may need to be established which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital position
3973796 we look forward to being leading issuers as the u s covered bond market develops
3973797 mortgage backed securities investors are not in the mood right now to buy bonds with anything less than government backing
3973798 the concept is certainly more interesting now than it has been in a very long time
3973799 covered bonds have the potential to increase mortgage financing improve underwriting standards and strengthen u s financial institutions
3973800 highly rated high quality covered bonds would generally fall within that broad range as eligible collateral
3973801 covered bonds can be a useful tool to help restore confidence and stability to the housing industry as well as to the mortgage finance system
3973802 certainly a law is better than a regulation but regulation seems to be plenty of comfort in a lot of areas
3973803 the real issue is if its substantive enough for the market not the form in which it comes
3973804 it needs a very strict and very clear legislation otherwise i dont think the investors will buy it
3973805 it became clear that if we took the lead we had a real chance to kick start this market
3973806 as we are all aware the availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing correction
3973807 we are at the early stages of what should be a promising path where the nascent u s covered bond market can grow and provide a new source of mortgage financing
3973808 as we are all aware the availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing correction covered bonds have the potential to increase mortgage financing
3973809 there are no magic bullets to solve the housing crisis
3973810 at times like this youre getting hit twice as hard
3973811 we really feel like we know bank stocks since were in the business
3973812 world markets are poised for a major relief rally today
3973813 this bill is going to make a difference almost immediately
3973814 this bill has moral hazard written all over it we are letting a monster loose
3973815 we are in the midst of the most serious economic crisis to face our nation in many years this bill is going to make a difference almost immediately
3973816 the economy is likely to slide into a more severe recession during the rest of the year as the credit crunch gradually begins to have a more pronounced impact on the economy
3973817 the epicentre of the financial market sell off will switch from the us into europe and oceania most of euroland has entered a recession a synchronised global downturn is on the agenda
3973818 the study predicts that house prices in england will rise by 25 per cent over the next five years
3973819 our report shows that despite concerns about the current housing market downturn house prices will increase substantially over the mid to long term
3973820 this is yet more very disturbing mortgage data that heighten concerns over the potential depth and length of the housing market correction
3973821 very low mortgage activity suggests that house prices will continue to head south at a pretty rapid rate
3973822 the latest numbers from the bank of england demonstrate in the clearest possible way the consequences of the credit crunch for the residential property market
3973823 given that more of their lenders existing mortgage backed borrowings will need to be repaid over the next three years their capacity to make new mortgage advances therefore looks severely constrained
3973824 in my opinion such a shortage of mortgage finance will persist through 2008 2009 and 2010
3973825 pension plans may have given up some of the hard earned gains from the past five years
3973826 if the plans get weaker the companies that sponsor them could get hit from a number of angles
3973827 i would say that starting from the premise that we are vulnerable is not a bad thing in a whole sphere of policies
3973828 the fact is that we are vulnerable psychologically it is both a liability and an asset
3973829 it is not every man for himself and every idea for itself and we all live happily ever after
3973830 we have to preserve this compact but never be trapped by our past
3973831 in those cities you have the weight of a middle country out there where established norms are sustained and persevered with and values evolve only gradually
3973832 our middle country is two or three subway stops from the centre of the financial district
3973833 that is why you need a certain degree of consensus building a degree of constraint in your social norms
3973834 we have not had the luxury of even contemplating insulating ourselves from global prices we are a small highly open economy a textbook case of a country that cannot insulate itself from global prices and trends how we behave and how we respond to the crisis is in a sense something that all countries will have elements of ultimately as you are finding across asia sustaining subsidies is an expensive proposition
3973835 its really not an economy that can be characterised in any sense as having command features
3973836 if we are interventionist it is in the social sphere in the way we shape our housing policies in the effort to achieve social cohesion and ethnic cohesion in our neighbourhoods
3973837 singapore is one of the freest economies in the world we make no bones about the fact that we do intervene in the social sphere to ensure a degree of mobility and cohesion that would not naturally come about through the free workings of the market
3973838 wall street gets confidence boost 3 08pm dow adds 190 points on surprise consumer confidence report better than expected financial results sinking crude futures and merrills writedown
3973839 i found this over at the implode o meter site and thought it explained the fannie freddie bailout to me better than anything else ive read
3973840 with the us housing market already in tatters such an increase in mortgage rates would steer the us economy into the whirlpool of credit contraction economic contraction currency depreciation and inflation the bane of all nations in history that have developed external debts beyond their means to repay
3973841 if the us did not act quickly to make the implicit guarantee of gse credit explicit for 984 billion in foreign central bank liabilities agency debt would have sold off and mortgage rates would have spiked
3973842 market needed to know what was going on in there
3973843 the rules of victory how to transform chaos and conflict strategies from
3973844 tobacco field in early morning where white sharecropper and wage laborer are priming tobacco
3973845 at the moment a bottom for the housing market is not visible
3973846 stemming the decline in the u s housing market is necessary for market stabilization as this would help both households and financial institutions to recover
3973847 the growing concern is that with delinquencies and foreclosures in the u s housing market rising sharply and house prices continuing to fall loan deterioration is becoming more widespread
3973848 as economic growth slows banks will face continued headwinds in maintaining earnings due to falling credit quality declining fee income high funding costs and exposures to monoline and mortgage insurers
3973849 there would have been systemic consequences had confidence in the debt come into question
3973850 part of the problem stems from the current regulatory framework which has allowed their balance sheets to expand to their current systemic significance
3973851 policy trade offs between inflation growth and financial stability are becoming increasingly difficult
3973852 with inflation risks on the rise the scope for monetary policy to be supportive of financial stability has become more constrained
3973853 there are now clear signs that investors are becoming more cautious about adding to positions
3973854 outflows from emerging market equity funds have been concentrated on asian markets where inflation and downside growth risks are most elevated
3973855 weve already seen a pretty sharp cooling in tax receipts and its just going to continue into next fiscal year
3973856 if these reports prove accurate they confirm the dismal legacy of the bush administration under its policies the largest surpluses in history have been converted into the largest deficits in history
3973857 we were losing ground to these incredible increases in construction costs but then to see the erosion in driving its a double whammy
3973858 were going to spend a lot of time money and effort on this
3973859 people need to understand that this infrastructure thing is not optional
3973860 all financials will make new lows not because of this weeks inflated rally but because we have not factored in the interplay of lower home prices a slower economy and we dont have proper marks on assets in our investment banks
3973861 investors should seek out safe yield as much as possible whether in the treasury market the muni market or among other high quality fixed income vehicles
3973862 all one has to do is pick up the newspaper to see that autos housing or practically anything you want to buy in a department store is experiencing fire sale conditions
3973863 back then collapsing earnings and price earnings multiples triggered a 40 percent peak to trough decline in the s amp p 500
3973864 if there is another bubble around the corner it is likely to be in bonds and this will be particularly apparent once the commodity explosion reverses course
3973865 would imply the potential for 1 75 trillion of incremental demand
3973866 that potential home grown demand for bonds can easily absorb the new government bond supply that is likely to come on stream to fight the economic downturn not to mention serve as a huge offset to any prospective selling of treasuries by global entities even if foreign investors do own half of the treasury market
3973867 the forces of deflation will outlast the cyclical inflation story
3973868 using the japan post bubble experience of the 1990s as a benchmark for comparison purposes may not be such a stretch as many people think it is because this is increasingly looking like a very similar secular bear market in equities
3973869 is going to grow longer given the stresses we have in the marketplace given the housing correction
3973870 most banks on the problem list are very unlikely to fail
3973871 on the one hand the fdic is promoting consumer education and empowering people
3973872 but on the other hand the fdic is withholding the most critical piece of information
3973873 the breadth and depth of the problems at indymac were apparent for years and they accelerated in the last six months
3973874 but the ots was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint
3973875 relied upon asserted and implied demonstrably and obviously false facts about the financial condition of bankatlantic and bancorp
3973876 because he was the only one to step up when the fdic wouldnt list the banks that are in trouble this story was repeated over and over
3973877 although the nations financial news lately has been a bit troubling and wachovia certainly isnt immune i want you to know that our company is on exceptionally sound footing
3973878 my point in telling you all this isnt to brag or illuminate issues in the overall economy
3973879 i want you to know that wachovia is ready to do business
3973880 we encourage all of our folks to engage in conversations
3973881 often it starts with wow its a tough time in the industry thats when our folks go into a nice job of launching
3973882 i do have a sense but i cant tell you
3973883 with inflation eroding households purchasing power a substantial recovery in consumer spending has now become very unlikely
3973884 we believe goldman would not look entirely askance at the prospect of buying a depository a significant change we still would not ascribe very high probability but if a bank with excess deposits were available at the right price with no need for goldman to exit existing businesses wed no longer rule it out
3973885 im deeply disappointed the white house will sign this bill in its current form
3973886 we must take responsible steps to ensure our financial and housing markets are sound but the democrats bill represents a multibillion dollar bailout for scam artists and speculative lenders at the expense of american taxpayers
3973887 i would hope that no one would be foreclosed upon between now and october 1st who would have qualified for this program had the effective date been immediate
3973888 i think it would be a shame an embarrassment to all of us if people were to lose their homes and the neighborhood deterioration were to be advanced and the economy would suffer because to satisfy cbo and other rules we delayed this a couple of months
3973889 the notion that this takes a normal bureaucratic response when you have this social and economic crisis is unacceptable that would be incompetence bordering on malfeasance
3973890 servicers are being asked to put a voluntary moratorium on some unknown number of foreclosures but nobody has addressed the servicer advances that must continue to be paid during this period
3973891 and worse yet nobody knows just how long servicers would need to keep advancing their money to a trust since apparently there is a good chance the program wouldnt be in place by october
3973892 nobody wants to take the pain for excesses each time the problem gets bigger
3973893 we would expect to see an increase in the number of homebuyers who are seeking fha financing to purchase a home and that will be a benefit to us
3973894 it should help reassure investors and people who are involved in the market that the government knows the importance of these institutions
3973895 the enhanced role of the fha should bring stability to many communities that have been particularly hard hit by the subprime crisis
3973896 there may be some reluctance on the part of servicers to write down loans
3973897 before you could cut the balance but the investor is still holding this loan
3973898 this moves the asset locks in a price for the investor and allows them to move on
3973899 this bill with the fha guarantee around it is going to encourage banks to use the program more
3973900 it gives the borrower and lender another tool to avoid foreclosure
3973901 if you remove the properties that would have been the biggest losses for the banks you raise the overall pricing
3973902 its going to help lenders minimize their losses and stabilize their mortgage businesses
3973903 we wrote this legislation specifically to bypass the normal rulemaking process
3973904 to tell me why they cant begin immediately to get this bill working
3973905 despite that congress provided no immediate funding for us to implement the entire bill even though we specifically requested they do so we will be working diligently to stand up the new refinance program
3973906 our goal is to make this a seamless transition and implementation
3973907 it is of the utmost importance to our market and economic stability that the gse portions of this bill become law
3973908 these components are orders of magnitude more important to turning the corner on the housing correction
3973909 oversight of the housing government sponsored enterprises and the new temporary authorities requested by secretary pauslon are urgently needed now and theyll contribute to confidence and stability in housing and financial markets
3973910 bank of america remains committed to helping our customers avoid foreclosure whenever they have a desire to remain in the property and a reasonable source of income
3973911 we have heard wildly different things about how much modification is going on
3973912 we have heard from industry that they are modifying like crazy and weve heard from consumer advocates that they are hardly modifying at all
3973913 yes im glad youre doing what youre doing but please dont take any comfort from it because weve got problems
3973914 if it is the case that the servicers cannot respond appropriately then that institution of a servicer acting on behalf of ultimate investors
3973915 reducing the interest rate will generally result in a lower loss to the investor than reducing the general balance
3973916 it is the preferred option that is the option that we are contractually bound to offer
3973917 then next year well have to change the law to reduce the role of servicers
3973918 i just didnt realize how quickly how fast the market was dropping
3973919 especially at the end when we really dropped our pants down and i felt we were giving it away and we still couldnt sell it
3973920 they have for more than 100 years 5 years 10 years itll be different then it is now
3973921 can you afford the payments can you have the insurance the property taxes the monthly payments with a normal 20 down sale does it work for the average person and when that happens when we hit that thats when we hit the bottom
3973922 you just have to have the staying power to weather the storm
3973923 wall st is bitch slapping main st til it bleeds from its ears and still no sign of a back bone from the u s public
3973924 as someone who tries to be informed and take reality as it comes i simply cant seem to maintain the cognitive dissonance required to resolve the extreme disparity between those two poles
3973925 im just tired of the endless stream of empty prattle about how good and great and perfect this country is im also very tired of how most people unquestioningly buy into it i guess im some kind of elitist
3973926 merril lynch in cowardly fashion just announced after hours that they have sold over 4 billion dollars worth of preferred stock to an investment company essentially deluding their stock by about 20 this after weeks of denials that they are having liquidity problems i am putting this in breaking news because this is serious shit and i dont want it to get missed i have to question whether we should be putting all financial news only in the financial section some breaking news is of serious consequence to everyone not just those that watch the markets this is a very big deal and will have repercussions for everyone this is the first big american financial institution to start marking down some of these types of assets they essentially have marked down by about 40 these types of assets they priced to market something they said was about 11 1 billion for about 8 billion i wonder how much of this was affected by the australian central banks move this past week is merril being smart and being the first one to rush the emergency doors while they still can well see this week if others follow suit
3973927 in a major fire sale of toxic assets by a struggling investment bank merrill lynch amp co mer said monday it has agreed to unload 30 6 billion in securities to private equity firm lone star at 22 cents on the dollar
3973928 and merrill sold them for 6 7 billion to an affiliate of lone star funds the dallas private equity firm merrill provided 75 percent financing to lone star funds which means merrill lent the private equity fund about 5 billion to complete the sale the discounted sales will cause the majority of merrills write down in the third quarter
3973929 they discovered that the american people were not very excited by the rather sterile concepts of capitalism or free enterprise but that they did exhibit a rather positive emotional response to the notion of
3973930 we are pushing forward the line on what the government will backstop and what the federal reserve will backstop
3973931 once the fed starts lending to a bridge bank or indirectly to the fdic where is the incentive to ever stop
3973932 like any open depository institution there will be short term borrowing needs by the bridge bank
3973933 longer term borrowing needs would typically be met by a loan from the fdic
3973934 to make it costly and difficult to support an insolvent institution
3973935 it was a weak quarter before and it remains a weak quarter
3973936 while everyone focuses on gdp keep in mind that it is not the only barometer of economic activity
3973937 as the stimulus spending wears off with the backdrop of a weak labor market consumer spending will take a leg down
3973938 were definitely looking for more contraction in the labor market
3973939 the risk for dramatic cutbacks in employment will be focused in the financial services industry
3973940 this company was aggressively selling ars to investors and its auction desk was censoring the research analysts to make sure they downplayed ars market risks in research reports up to the day merrill pulled the plug on its auctions
3973941 they knew the auction markets were in trouble but the investors were the last to know
3973942 represents the final step in the resolution of this matter with the massachusetts attorney general
3973943 the market is collapsing no more 2k dinners at cru
3973944 giving our servicers more time and greater compensation to help troubled borrowers is fundamental to preserving homeownership and maximizing our efforts to minimize foreclosures
3973945 the fed acknowledges that circumstances in financial markets remain fragile
3973946 theres very little good news with general motors then you consider all the mortgage related problems
3973947 its a huge advantage to have that aaa status and we are committed to that
3973948 in the short run the deficit and debt as a percentage of the economy are within the range needed to maintain our aaa rating
3973949 ten years from now if debt is still rising and nothing has been done
3973950 if no policy changes are made in 10 years from now we would have to look very seriously at whether the u s is still a aaa credit
3973951 compared to the u s banks and ubs theres a world of difference
3973952 in the current market it isnt a given that a bank remains profitable
3973953 we will continue to strictly manage cost risk and capital and to reduce our exposures in key areas
3973954 this latest i v keeps the patient in stable but not critical condition but not ready for discharge
3973955 these actions should help to somewhat alleviate market stresses but are incremental rather than transformational
3973956 it should be a plus for depository institutions and financial institutions in general
3973957 the fed was clear that these facilities pdcf and tslf are temporary and will end when it judges the emergency has passed
3973958 some reduction of uncertainty in the banking sector is a prerequisite but right now it seems another shoe is falling every other day
3973959 conditions in financial markets remain very fragile with key gauges of the health of the financial sector only looking moderately better than the most recent peak in the spring
3973960 theres still a lot of serious issues out there that need to be resolved and more bonds that need to be marked down across the financial spectrum
3973961 we estimate that this deleveraging will depress credit supply to the non bank sector by roughly 15 percent in the united states and 12 percent in euroland by 2010
3973962 the current credit tightening has the potential to be a significant drag on growth for some time to come
3973963 creditors in the united states are wary of making mortgage loans consumer loans and student loans all of which are rising in price and have become less available
3973964 there is no forcing banks to take on increased risk at a time when their losses are mounting
3973965 todays decision by the fed is the right one for the american economy
3973966 continued access to the window will help calm the waters at a tumultuous time the availability of this potential liquidity reassures the market and provides a backstop that because of its mere presence makes it less likely to be utilized
3973967 cautious about recovery in the credit markets for the remainder of 2008
3973968 we are holding the credit rating agencies accountable for a secret wall street tax on main street
3973969 this rating charade created a wall street shell game constructed by the ratings agencies for the benefit of the bond insurers
3973970 thats like saying its wrong to measure distance in centimeters and right to measure it in inches
3973971 its like the umpires having a small strike zone for the good pitchers and a regular strike zone for all of the rest
3973972 fitch rates connecticut and all states based on our forward looking opinion as to their financial capacity to pay their debts as they come due not based solely on historical rates of default
3973973 i believe in branding and i dont see a reason to kill it after 85 years of building it
3973974 as a result you want to keep the name that signifies brokerage and that of course is bear stearns
3973975 the strategy is to keep the culture intact but tap into the products at jpmorgan
3973976 my philosophy is seek to be the best and dont confuse being the best with being the biggest
3973977 what we want to do is improve on the quality of our brokers maintain their business model but give them access to the products of jpmorgan
3973978 these are essential areas were looking at cutting thats how bad our economic situation is
3973979 weve been running a deficit but weve been bailed out by wall street many times
3973980 but we need to look and think creatively about how to create long term revenue streams and provide opportunities for the state to grow
3973981 when the governor talks about families who cant afford to heat their homes cant afford to put gas in their cars and cant afford groceries he is describing his own workers and their families who will only be hurting more after he takes away their jobs
3973982 something that provided more consistency and stability to aigs earnings growth
3973983 this year with hedge funds we saw some meaningful reductions in income
3973984 we had a very good year last year and we had a not so pretty year this year
3973985 every company thinks theyre special that somehow theyre more able than others to invest and deliver these returns without the volatility and losses
3973986 there were a number of years where alternatives were booking 20 percent type returns
3973987 if oil prices are going up 20 and 30 a barrel a quarter like they have been it hides a lot of flaws
3973988 the question on everyones mind is how do these guys expect to grow production given the restrictions on access to reserves
3973989 these data reinforce our view that the u k economy is going into recession
3973990 with monetary and fiscal policy both hamstrung most of the economic pain still lies ahead
3973991 the weakening economy and poor housing market sentiment do not suggest that the market will recover quickly
3973992 the risk of an economic recession in the u k is now clearly rising
3973993 you can take me back to the days of the bombings
3973994 business was better then five of my six lorries havent left the yard for months
3973995 first time buyers are now frozen out the investors have packed up
3973996 properties would go on the market and the same day there was maybe 10 or 20 bids in
3973997 it was frenzied now its different the level of interest just isnt there
3973998 during the boom nothing surprised me and 40 percent of property deals in the city were made by southern investors
3973999 im living in my mums house and renting the flat out just to pay the mortgage
3974000 i can hardly afford to go out through the door because of it
3974001 there is a risk that the property prices will slip a bit more
3974002 the associated business service side has caught the chill as well
3974003 even during the troubles it wasnt as hard as it is now
3974004 consensus forecasts for the decline in house prices is now in the range of 15pc 20pc over 2008 and 2009 combined
3974005 we expect uk gdp growth to remain positive in 2008 but with a risk to the downside in 2009
3974006 in light of the deteriorating economic environment we expect to see upward pressure on impairment losses
3974007 post the rights issue and with stable and potentially improving margins underpinning pre provisioning profitability we are well placed to compete in tougher markets
3974008 valuation companies issue reports for whatever amount the bank managers are prepared to lend
3974009 the spanish market is not the u s property market
3974010 we dont have the famous subprime generally speaking the collateral for each loan is always quite high
3974011 subprime lending meaning poorly documented very long term increasing interest mortgage loans where repayment by the debtor depends sometimes critically on the ability to refinance simply does not exist in spain
3974012 both banks have been performing well against their peer group
3974013 diversifying into other markets should help protect them against the economic slowdown in spain
3974014 theres no doubt both banks will suffer somewhat from the indigestion caused by the spanish housing market
3974015 the difference between securitisers and banks is they can raise short term funding through the rba non banks need to be in a position to access the same liquidity
3974016 we hear the treasurer talk about competition but were it
3974017 weve been doing this for 20 years and have data that goes as far back as 1865 and its really abnormal
3974018 australia is headed for a once in 100 year real estate slump
3974019 i have never seen the convergence of so many negatives
3974020 by every metric i can think of australian houses are too expensive
3974021 with u s cotton subsidies there does not appear to be any way out retaliation is the only option for the government now
3974022 there was some kind of agreement that brazil would not retaliate because doha was supposed to solve the cotton problem but now there is no hope of such a solution
3974023 the government wont like it but the rule is if you win the appeal trade sanctions are the only option
3974024 going to the wto and asking the dispute settlement body to analyze the legal basis of the u s tariff is now possible
3974025 of course we would prefer a negotiated solution litigation could be complicated look what happened with cotton
3974026 bilateral talks are always a possibility but there is little mood now
3974027 i doubt well see any results in the short term
3974028 l g let me ask you a cheap question your book in hardcover has sold more than a million copies by now hasnt it n k i dont actually know the numbers laughs l g the checks are coming in regular or your agent will know the reason why and im sure the paperback will do equally well but if youre not a disaster capitalist yourself to what extent are you the beneficiary of this phenomenon
3974029 purely hypothetically every single step the lords have taken in the last 25 years has made matters worse for the citizens that is either an amazing string of failures or an unparalled success rate
3974030 as for financial issues ive said before that i fully expect government to choose inflation over deflation if they can
3974031 any other way of organizing transactions among humans and the rest of the natural world other than the criminal system we are now under
3974032 the great depression v 2 is unavoidable what should we do to avoid v 3
3974033 any other way of organizing transactions among humans and the rest of the natural world other than the criminal system we are now under
3974034 we need to work on creating a stable and responsible species the present one wouldnt know what to do with a stable financial system well except screw it up
3974035 the dynamics of boom and bust will always be with us as they are an integral part of us but without the lifetime energy subsidy provided by fossil fuels we will return to the limited potential for wealth concentration typical of the past after some of us live through an undershoot lasting decades at least
3974036 i know i am wired such and such but i can rise above it
3974037 ilargi amp stoneleigh think about collecting your wit and wisdom for a book
3974038 and third john and john do the logic of the washington diplomatic world
3974039 nonsense this is all the greed of the lords you peasants
3974040 the primary benefit of this agreement is that it eliminates uncertainty with respect to future losses related to this transaction
3974041 we view the final outcome as favorable in light of the numerous widely circulated models that assumed a 100 percent write off for this transaction
3974042 nonsense this is all the greed of the lords you peasants
3974043 if people perceive a disaster many of them will do lots of things that are not of direct benefit to themselves for the larger group i
3974044 they wont be able to give you a rationalization other than an after the fact one that is because reason doesnt guide their actions
3974045 what goes up must come down house price dynamics in the united states
3974046 around 14 percent above equilibrium in the first quarter of 2008 with a plausible range of 8 to 20 percent
3974047 starts in foreclosures which obviously add to inventory seem to also exert additional downward pressure on prices
3974048 while the national price level is falling on every measure there is an opinion that this decline might reflect oversized drops in a few isolated markets rather than a countrywide phenomenon
3974049 the affirmation of the senior unsecured debt ratings reflects the strong explicit and implicit support these government sponsored enterprise gse securities hold in the marketplace
3974050 thats nice you now have 200 but the value of each of those dollars has been cut in half
3974051 this is even worse than the nightmare of corruption you described
3974052 im not one to paint a rosy picture at all
3974053 i would be opening my cheque book to the banks and building societies to try to stop the housing market slide
3974054 if there are people out there prepared to borrow money from the government through banks and building societies then thats what we need at the moment the sooner the government spends the money the less it will have to spend eventually once these markets collapse and confidence disappears there are all sorts of consequences in terms of job losses which will be even more costly for the wider economy
3974055 were not sure this is a clever time to make acquisitions
3974056 earnings will be far less closely watched than movements on writedowns as well as managements willingness to engage in self help
3974057 the hbos model has been extremely severely challenged significantly higher funding costs have rendered some types of asset growth unprofitable mortgages in particular
3974058 hbos faces a perfect storm we think profits will fall for the next three years
3974059 these are all below the lows seen during the last recession in the uk in the early 1990s
3974060 its a possibility that some operators will go bust everybodys suffering at the moment
3974061 if we dont get some remedial action we will be in a crisis were having severe difficulties now and britain is going to need a lot more residential care in future
3974062 its not very magical in the long term demographics mean this is a good sector to be in but guess what if you borrow too much you are totally f
3974063 there was tons of m amp a over the last couple of years it was all pass the parcel stuff putting ever higher levels of debt onto these businesses and now frankly the music has stopped
3974064 the deflating u s global asset markets are much like churchills russia
3974065 money laundering red flags large amounts of cash maintained in a safe deposit box a customer may access the safe deposit box after completing a transaction involving a large withdrawal of cash or may access the safe deposit box prior to making cash deposits which are just under 10 000
3974066 how to get the information yourself visit your bank ask a few well worded questions being careful not to arouse suspicion if that doesnt work talk to friends and other family members maybe theyve heard something or as a last resort just point blank call the bank manager in private and demand to know whats all this business with the homeland security deciding what i can have from my safe deposit box tell me now or ill close my account today ill bet if you put forth the effort youll get the answers you want
3974067 miss louise lester in charge of mutilation of old money at treasury dept
3974068 this sends a loud and clear signal that the issue with cdos is not liquidity in the market but problems with the value of their underlying assets
3974069 the accountants will have to put significant pressure on their clients to write down these assets fannie mae and freddie mac in particular as this high profile transaction has underscored the losses that are inherent in these kind of asset backed securities
3974070 the upside of the underlying subprime assets in the cdo pools
3974071 purchased a call option on the value of the subprime assets backing the cdo
3974072 may set a benchmark that will be followed by other financials
3974073 the facilities would be withdrawn should the board determine that conditions in financial markets are no longer unusual and exigent
3974074 for exercise in advance of periods that are typically characterized by elevated stress in financial markets such as quarter ends
3974075 the financial system has no more capital left and the taf is the only way the federal reserve can get capital back in the system so the federal reserve has taken bad debts in exchange for capital onto their balance sheet this makes them very nervous
3974076 it is amazing that in the midst of the biggest commodity boom ever seen they have still been unable to get a current account surplus they have been living beyond their means for 10 years what worries me is that productivity growth has been very low they have coasting after their reforms in the 1990s
3974077 australia will now have to generate 4pc of gdp to meet payments to foreign holders of its assets
3974078 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac
3974079 the federal housing administration will begin to implement new policies intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
3974080 its not all a matter of tighter financial conditions scaring borrowers
3974081 borrowers dont want to borrow as much because the expected returns arent as great
3974082 must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder owned companies
3974083 any legislation exposing taxpayers to this risk should include a serious debate on long term reforms and a ban on lobbying must be included
3974084 using its cost of funds advantage to lever its balance sheet
3974085 buying manufactured housing aircraft lease equipment alt a mortgages the taxpayers should not fund the non corporate businesses
3974086 freddie announced its intentions to raise 10 billion of equity on july 18 filed a shelf offering on the 22nd and the clock is still ticking
3974087 it took merrill lynch 12 hours to pull off an 8 55 billion stock sale
3974088 while much speculation has been made about goldmans interest in acquiring a retail bank we believe the chances are less than slim
3974089 management stated that the company would only be interested in purchasing a bank if it was able to use the acquired deposits as a funding source for any other part of the business and without additional regulatory scrutiny
3974090 cfo viniar did caveat that clearly if the regulatory pendulum swung to an extreme so as to force broker dealers to convert into a bank holding structure then gs would be interested in acquiring bank deposits
3974091 management believes these headwinds will continue to persist if not accentuate
3974092 this is a watershed transaction that provides price transparency this is the first large scale cdo transaction that is not a distressed sale
3974093 the question is is that now the clearing price for anyone who has cdos
3974094 the current environment is not one where people are prepared to give the benefit of the doubt
3974095 other buyers out there are going to use this as a reference point
3974096 the question is to what extent does 22 cents constitute fair value or the price at which a bank could offload a huge volume of very distressed assets
3974097 there has not been a single american dollar cash flow loss against the asset backed commercial paper i rush to add that that is not a forecast for the future
3974098 the values take into account everything including underlying asset flows and external market events we would certainly take the merrill sale into account but it wouldnt be a single driver of valuation
3974099 if you are a homeowner it is harder to refinance if you are a company you cant borrow money as before
3974100 even if the trustee elects to initiate a servicing transfer the fdic may ignore the request in order to maximize the value of the assets it plans to sell
3974101 so the event of default directly resulting from receivership will not trigger an immediate transfer of indymac servicing
3974102 w e believe that once the fdic decides to assume the servicing contract it would be required to advance and comply with the servicing agreement the bottom line is that we dont believe the fdic can selectively comply with the terms of the servicing agreement
3974103 nobody really knows which way the fdic will go on this or if they can sell the entire portfolio to one buyer
3974104 there arent but four or five firms that could take on this big of a portfolio in one piece and so far its anyones guess if theres interest there enough to make it the least costly scenario the fdic will look for
3974105 ideal test case with which to trigger a paradigm shift
3974106 an ugly combination of weak gdp growth poor international competitiveness and rising government borrowing costs could lead to renewed calls for italy to leave the euro
3974107 as things stand not only will italy lose ground to the rest of the eurozone it could soon start to do so at an even more rapid rate
3974108 we have learned a lot from investing in merrill lynch and will take a more cautious approach in the future
3974109 while these are merrill specific deals they do have the potential to create marks and put pressure on some other companies to de risk their balance sheets and take their lumps in an effort to move forward
3974110 this is the first large scale cdo transaction that is not a distressed sale
3974111 industry participants will likely mark super senior cdo assets with 2006 and 2007 vintage collateral down to the 22 cent range
3974112 although ubs has said it expects to break even in the second quarter there is a risk that their results announcement will also include plans to accelerate the rate at which they sell off their subprime exposures and this could result in yet another large write off and a capital raising exercise to compensate
3974113 its a tale of two sectors that are really driving things
3974114 because of high oil prices a weak housing market and a weak job market the consumer is under unprecedented stress
3974115 a lot of it does come down to the auto companies
3974116 in 2000 we had a technology bubble but this is massive a massive credit crisis and a bubble in global housing global equity and global land
3974117 put money into something incredibly safe like a high quality hedge fund
3974118 i bought my first gold last week and i hate gold it doesnt pay a dividend i would only do it if i was desperate
3974119 just imagine we have chosen to borrow money from china so we can buy oil from the middle east and use it to pollute the planet
3974120 the fed has created a bubble in everything stocks in emerging market real estate everywhere in the world commodities art
3974121 the only asset class that is down is the u s dollar
3974122 it is quite likely that the current synchronized global economic boom and the universal all encompassing asset bubble will lead to a colossal bust
3974123 he sees that we are in a muddy risk environment
3974124 he wants to makes sure the price is absolutely reflective of any downside scenarios
3974125 there are a lot of regional banks that the management team is in it to eventually be acquired but they are not talking about it because valuations are so depressed
3974126 its certainly a buyers market it would be to their advantage to do something relatively soon
3974127 this will be the worst quarter in the cycle in terms of earnings performances
3974128 the reason im not recommending moodys is its a pure play rating agency
3974129 they are getting the full negative of the near term trend the positive is a five year story not a one year story
3974130 the revenue from securitization ratings was a substantial component of their profitability
3974131 the level of securitization and their financial performance is highly correlated
3974132 is that to say were not going to see growth from these levels because securitization is forever impaired and gone
3974133 the damage on wall street is infecting all of our communities and its effects on new york state finances are devastating
3974134 it is time for us and other governments to cut up our credit cards
3974135 new york state has spent money it didnt have and borrowed to make up the difference
3974136 the commission will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
3974137 it seems like a pretty restrictive rule to put in place for the entire market
3974138 i hope they dont go market wide because that would take six months to a year to implement
3974139 capital has to be extended systems have to be rebuilt and were talking about months of infrastructure building
3974140 it is turning out to be a very grim summer for many retailers pressure from higher fuel and food prices is prompting many people to rein in their spending proving that value retailing has never been more important
3974141 the faltering housing market has really depressed sales of home furnishings and white goods this month and the high street is still struggling but supermarkets are faring better
3974142 the retail sector will have to focus more than ever on providing good value to customers if they want to keep the sun shining this summer
3974143 the cbis july distributive trades survey is a real shocker pointing to consumer spending starting off the third quarter very much on the back foot indeed evidence is mounting that consumers are now reining in their spending appreciably in the face of seriously squeezed purchasing power and other significant pressures
3974144 it was only the latest number in a string of very weak data that confirm that the economy is experiencing a severe downturn
3974145 it will be very hard to see the return to relatively healthy growth numbers the ecb currently envisages from q4 onwards
3974146 business and consumer confidence is being pummeled by a myriad of factors
3974147 these notably include elevated energy and food prices the ongoing credit crunch and financial market turmoil the very strong euro the ecbs raising of interest rates in july and fears that it could tighten monetary policy further and serious concerns about the global economic outlook
3974148 hiring intentions in industry and services fell away sharply continuing the recent trend and offering further evidence to suggest that a vicious circle of weaker spending output and employment is now in train just the kind of vicious circle which leads to a recession
3974149 the low level of the indicator suggests that economic activity in industry remains subdued
3974150 if theres anyone whos to have the risk appetite in this kind of environment its going to be the alternative investment community
3974151 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
3974152 its very disappointing that its gone this way in the student loan industry
3974153 lenders have been having a hard time raising enough capital to continue making loans
3974154 the whole problem in the capital markets started with mortgages and has drifted down
3974155 difficulty in the capital markets in the last few months has made it extremely difficult for us to secure funding for the fall season
3974156 the financial aid office sent me all the information that i needed to know and they assured me that if i followed the steps id be all set
3974157 i would have much rather taken out a loan there than somewhere where i didnt know anyone
3974158 everyones on the same page no one wants to see a student denied any access to a federal student loan
3974159 we have missed the chance to seal the first global pact of a reshaped world order we would all have been winners from a doha deal without one we all lose
3974160 years of negotiation which were and are important for globalisation have been sacrificed by this failure and there would appear to be no short term fix
3974161 this is undoubtedly the biggest blow to globalisation since it gathered pace after the fall of the berlin wall it is a deliberate and serious blow to multilateralism and has raised further the spectre of protectionism which is always evident at a time of weak economic growth and recession
3974162 so once the rules go into effect they are insolvent
3974163 attention attention we have hit an iceberg we are now looking for a volunteer to be captain of the ship
3974164 in the 1930s hoovervilles shantytowns formed coast to coast in cities of the united states some families were fortunate enough to stay with friends and family members that hadnt been evicted yet but homeless men women and children were forced to take up residence in shacks as a result of the great depression angry cold and hungry americans who had no other place to reside dubbed groups of those shacks in honor of president herbert hoover
3974165 if someone asked me now who id most like to meet and invite to dinner id say ilargi and stoneleigh stoneleighs wisdom patience and kindness also amazes me
3974166 its not who votes that counts its who counts the votes
3974167 if someone asked me now who id most like to meet and invite to dinner id say ilargi and stoneleigh stoneleighs wisdom patience and kindness also amazes me
3974168 the great depression v2 0 implies that humanity hasnt learned its lesson or to put it a different way that we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results so have you two done any work on creating a stable and responsible financial system
3974169 why on earth is the collapse of the doha round
3974170 that means the united states and europe will continue to waste billions of dollars and euros every year in agricultural subsidies
3974171 do you own stock in archer daniels midland or something
3974172 if there was any country in the world that had the capacity to withstand the full force of these developments particularly on international financial markets it is this country
3974173 im satisfied that our regulators are satisfied that the disclosures are satisfactory
3974174 wilmington delaware july 30 reuters the financial accounting standards board which sets u s accounting rules voted on wednesday to delay accounting changes that would affect trillions in off balance sheet assets at banks and financial companies
3974175 det r samma sak som om din son r med i ett fotbollslag och pl tsligt blir utbytt av tr naren
3974176 mrs sam cates wife of cow hollow farmer malheur county oregon
3974177 banks and brokers will destroy somewhere between 1 000bn to 1 400bn of their own risk free capital owing to losses on all forms of credit in this crunch
3974178 you are left with a reduction of 5 7 in global credit
3974179 so even a standstill in total credit outstanding is a credit crunch
3974180 we think that about 65bn in extra capital is needed in order to compensate for the credit crunch and to keep lending at recent levels
3974181 and banks are already showing signs of contracting just for their balance sheets just to stagnate uk banks may have to raise 35bn
3974182 the consequences of this squeeze on capital for the real economy could be devastating
3974183 most areas of the country are seeing at least some increase in foreclosure activity
3974184 forty eight of 50 states and 95 out of the nations 100 largest metro areas experienced year over year increases in foreclosure activity
3974185 weve been saying foreclosures will total 1 9 million to 2 million this year
3974186 but midway through the year were already at 1 4 million so were going to be raising our projections
3974187 i dont think thats a surprise if you look at the general conditions out there
3974188 there have been six straight moves of weaker employment this year the ongoing problems in the housing market are compounded by a generally weaker economy foreclosures wont go down until we start to see employment move up again
3974189 i am urging the mortgage servicers to hold off on foreclosures in applicable cases
3974190 rising foreclosures are putting downward pressure on prices increasing the possibility that homeowners will go upside down on their mortgages
3974191 that will cause more losses in mortgage portfolios and less willingness from investors to securitize mortgages and therefore fewer mortgages
3974192 the big variable here is what effect the housing bill now being considered by the senate is going to have on foreclosure activity in general
3974193 based on market conditions themselves we are nowhere near the end of this trip best case scenario were looking at another year of this
3974194 the current balance is probably untenable over the longer term
3974195 i believe there is going to have to be a fundamental rethinking of the future of these institutions
3974196 i think down the road we should review the hybrid nature of fannie mae and freddie mac
3974197 monetary policy cannot bear the sole responsibility of responding to those challenges
3974198 more robust to very bad outcomes and more resilient to shocks
3974199 replacing our ongoing role as consolidated supervisor with standby contingent authority to intervene would risk exacerbating moral hazard and adding to uncertainty about the rules of the game
3974200 overall the conditions in the labour market make a recession a very likely outcome for spain
3974201 the economic adjustment has been much more abrupt and faster than we expected
3974202 economic growth in the eurozone is coming almost to a halt the data strengthen those at the ecb who had gone along only grudgingly with the july rate hike and now want to prevent any extra rate increase with just a bit of bad luck any further monetary tightening could possibly push the eurozone into a brief recession in our view
3974203 the latest very weak survey data from the eurozone will surely prevent the european central bank from raising interest rates further
3974204 on the face of it the surveys suggest there is now even a risk of a technical recession in the region
3974205 this is likely to remain the central banks dominant worry and will probably push it to raise rates again despite signs that downside risks to the economy are materialising
3974206 the golden years of the real estate business are well and truly over
3974207 more than 98 of home loans in spain are priced off euribor the interbank interest rate
3974208 the recent abysmal news from spain reinforces our view that the economys us style imbalances are coming home to roost and that growth will be far weaker than generally expected
3974209 is capitulating in a way that will have surprised even the most ardent doomsayers
3974210 and we see little reason why that trend should reverse over the medium term there is even the possibility of five years of no economic growth
3974211 especially stringent capital restrictions laid down by the bank of spain
3974212 help them weather an economic downturn seen lasting until at least 2010
3974213 bad debt levels could more than double to 4 by late next year
3974214 fall could create a domino effect through the sector and then the economy
3974215 danger of a meltdown as both households and companies are extremely highly leveraged
3974216 the spanish economy may be about to fall off a cliff
3974217 the euros 25 to 30 overvaluation against the us dollar
3974218 signed a non binding letter of intent to sell a controlling interest in financial data services inc fds
3974219 the 0 2pc rise in uk gdp in q2 shows that the economy has weakened dramatically even before the full impact of the credit squeeze and housing downturn has been felt an outright recession is now our central scenario
3974220 well get negative growth for the next two quarters were now looking at quite deep interest rate cuts next year
3974221 not only is ubs guilty of committing a flagrant breach of trust between the bank and its customers its top executives jumped ship as soon the securities market started to collapse leaving thousands of customers holding the bag
3974222 it is frustrating that the new york attorney general has filed this complaint while we at ubs have been fully engaged in good faith negotiations with his office to bring liquidity to our clients holding auction rate securities
3974223 the prices of the bonds have dropped dramatically and as a result of that there is fear that
3974224 after the rally over the past couple of days in financials the market is back to picking at some of the problems again
3974225 right now we dont have any need to go to the capital markets for any issuance of debt and so the impact of this is quite low for us right now
3974226 the loss of investment grade ratings would likely result in further reductions in the sources of liquidity available to the company
3974227 these guys have not done a stellar job now theyre paying the price for it
3974228 i think their capital is adequate right now however if you cause a run on the bank and people panic you erode the confidence and its a dicier environment
3974229 the manufacturing sector is not showing typical recession like weakness so far
3974230 the weight of evidence still suggests the economy is weakening despite this positive number
3974231 manufacturers in several districts anticipated further factory weakness in the near future
3974232 while most districts expected stable capital spending heading forward a few noted manufacturers plans to reevaluate based on current economic conditions
3974233 indymac started going to hell in the second half of last year
3974234 we called in the fdic to join the exam with us early on in the process
3974235 were fully aware of everything to do with indymacs situation it was not a surprise
3974236 we thought indymac had the opportunity to work through its problems
3974237 the fdic has backup authority if the primary authority is asleep at the switch
3974238 everyone expects regulators to be ahead of the curve but they never are its hard for regulators to be proactive if the fdic was beating the hell out of indymac a year ago the congressmen that represent indymac would have been all over them
3974239 we have identified about 10 percent that are in significant distress and another 10 to 15 percent headed in that direction
3974240 will be a lot bigger but i have a feeling they dont want to put a real big one on there it starts a guessing game who went on who went off
3974241 every time the long only guys tip their toes in the water they get whacked its been absolutely tough
3974242 rising economic pressures on financially vulnerable households possibly related to the national crisis in subprime and adjustable rate mortgages
3974243 it certainly doesnt help matters that people are freaking out and taking their money
3974244 this will help to contribute to a longer drawn out down market
3974245 its money chasing returns it happens on the way up and it happens on the way down
3974246 the current dynamics in the housing markets will force further asset disposals which in turn will push prices lower causing yet another round of sales and foreclosures
3974247 it just shows that no one is insulated from the crisis
3974248 this shows that even the best of the best arent doing so hot
3974249 i dont see any particular conclusions drawn from this its going to take more to establish
3974250 if financial institutions of freddie mac and fannie maes calibre could get into such a bad situation then what does that mean for chinese financial institutions
3974251 the only reason we havent seen similar problems here is because property prices have continued to rise rapidly
3974252 anyone can get a mortgage loan in china no matter who they are
3974253 there is also a huge amount of speculation in the market and insider dealing when it comes to bank officers granting loans
3974254 whats shocking is that the profit warning is coming from munich re which is widely considered to be the insurer with the most defensive capital reserves
3974255 if markets dont calm down it will also be difficult for us to reach our forecast
3974256 if i owe you a pound i have a problem but if i owe you a million the problem is yours
3974257 the only man who sticks closer to you in adversity than a friend is a creditor
3974258 we interrupt regular programming to announce that the united states of america has defaulted on its debt
3974259 ten bear market phases 1 a huge buy the dip mentality sets in during the initial decline most party goes cannot fathom that party has ended 2 moderate concern sets in when buy the dip stops working 3 initial panic 4 numerous bottom calls are made all wrong 5 search for the guilty 6 punishment of the innocent 7 more panic 8 lawsuits fly 9 regulatory power is given to those most responsible for spiking the punch bowl 10 congress gets in the act and makes things worse
3974260 i appreciate that providing citizens with an insiders understanding of how money and resources work is always a sensitive issue so much political and economic control depends on the financial system remaining overly complex to busy people my first experience with being censored was in the first bush administration the situation at the new york times got so ugly that the reporter had to resign the times bureau chief was rewriting the article without her permission she caught it and stopped the story and then resigned from the times and retired from the industry
3974261 trading note yesterday lowrysselling pressure index rose to within one point of its july 15 all time high that tells me that big money has been selling into all rallies and thats just plain bearish selling pressure should be declining rapidly when the market rallies thats not what is happening
3974262 if i owe you ten dollars its my problem if i owe you a trillion its your problem
3974263 if you lose your pluck you lose the most there is in you all youve got to live with
3974264 unless we provide some type of footing for housing in the united states i do not think that the economy will begin to recover it is perhaps the most significant economic issue that we face
3974265 this legislation is going to be the linchpin that helps millions of families have decent safe and affordable housing
3974266 we had factored in some federal support for these securities but now i think the financial risks are now outweighing support and have to be reflected in the rating
3974267 we feel that given the changing market dynamics and the changing legislation landscape that that heightened risk should be more of a factor in our current
3974268 the fact that they lumped the sub debt in there seems questionable
3974269 if we are talking about equity capital being contributed by the government by any measure that we can come up with that should protect the subordinated debt
3974270 s amp p downgrading fannie and freddie is seeping in and the financial system is going under the waves people might have looked up at the calendar and saw it was friday too
3974271 although much of the fallout from foreclosures is being driven by rampant activity in a few states such as nevada california florida ohio arizona and michigan most areas of the country are seeing at least some increase in foreclosure activity
3974272 at least theyre aware that weve entered the early innings of what could easily become a very disruptive period of our history
3974273 most of them are responding constructively rather than just defensively theyre much more interested in gardening and animal husbandry than firearms
3974274 the gun nuts have been on the scene longer than the peak oil argument has been in play
3974275 they were initially preoccupied with big government and its accompanying narrative fantasy of fascist oppression which is why they adopted a fascist tone themselves but peak oil survivalists are different from the ruby ridge generation they dont think that a bolt hole in the woods is a very promising strategy we have no idea at this point what the level of social cohesion or disorder may be but if the rural areas especially the agricultural centers become too lawless for farming then well be in pretty severe trouble because there will be nothing for us to eat
3974276 there is greater interest in preparedness these days because the fragility of our economy lengthening chains of supply and the complexity of the technological infrastructure have become apparent to a broader cross section of the populace
3974277 all parties concerned may not realize it but the left of center greens calling for local economies and encouraging farmers markets have a tremendous amount in common with john birchers decrying globalist bankers and gun owners complaining about their constitutional rights at the core for all of them is the recognition that big entrenched centralized power structures are not the answer they are in fact the problem
3974278 id say that survivalism is indeed a celebration of community
3974279 it is the embodiment of americas traditional can do spirit of self reliance that settled the frontier
3974280 it seems a natural human impulse that we are hard wired to follow as circumstances require
3974281 although it is constrained by social and cultural conditioning to some degree in our consumer culture survivalism is related to the gear fetishism you see in popular magazines that purport to be about sporting adventures but are really about acquiring snazzy equipment america in 2008 has become a cartoon culture of hollywood violence that promotes grandiose power fantasies of hyper individualism and vigilante justice add guns and economic hardship and spice it up with ethnic grievances and the recipe is not very appetizing
3974282 we were outpacing the national economy for a while there certainly
3974283 weve kind of come back to earth in terms of converging with the national economy the fact is that we have converged to a slowing national economy
3974284 the greatest risk to the citys budget is the extent and the depth of the slowdown particularly as it affects wall street
3974285 nobody knows how long it will take to get through this mess
3974286 conditions in the auto finance market are not too good
3974287 other issuers have had pretty good success in the market
3974288 will place negative pressure on the subordinate bonds of certain auto asset backed securities transactions
3974289 we were always optimistic when we were young we thought that every year things would get better
3974290 the bubble has burst i think my generation will be the last to see a great america
3974291 weve all been so greedy for so long and it has caught up with us
3974292 we have become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline thank god the economy is not as bad as you read in the newspaper every day
3974293 people lost their homes even though they had borrowed only 10 of the purchase price
3974294 people dont want to buy round here because they see all these empty houses and wonder whats wrong with the area
3974295 if you do some research you can make a lot out of nothing
3974296 its the end of an empire sale and everything must go
3974297 were so hard up for cash were dismantling america and selling it for scrap
3974298 if we were going to make a move in the next 10 years this would be as good a time as any
3974299 seem to have a little better access to financing than we do in the u s
3974300 you can get more products through the same distribution channels
3974301 the u s is still the biggest and richest market in the world
3974302 if you have global aspirations you need to be in the u s
3974303 we see a lot of action in high quality growth companies
3974304 outsized growth came at a price in terms of credit quality
3974305 on our estimates a rise of fractionally more than 0 1pc a month between july and september would be enough to avoid a quarter of negative growth though on the trend of the last two months you would not bet on it after an unbroken run of 64 quarters the first negative quarter since 1992 appears to be under way
3974306 an outright recession is now our central scenario with industrial production having fallen in both the first and second quarters industry is already in recession
3974307 looking ahead the more up to date surveys suggest that in q3 so far overall economic growth has ground to a complete halt
3974308 the recent drop in the oil price and the price wars on the petrol forecourts support our view that the next rate cut could come late this year but this will be too late to prevent a recession
3974309 this we know from the opinion he the controller cannot make any further payments
3974310 state law does not authorize the controller to disburse state funds to employees until an applicable appropriation
3974311 i dont see any difference if the case was brought again today
3974312 and its simply not fair that people who work an honest day dont receive the pay theyve been promised
3974313 structural inequality has been rising at a level we havent seen since before the great depression
3974314 and the natural response both psychologically and economically is to make the tax system more progressive
3974315 they are not moving to nevada the difference between californias tax system and those in the other states that people would realistically move to are pretty minuscule
3974316 major players seem more than willing to pay the cost of living in california because there is a dramatic difference in the economic resources and opportunities
3974317 its much more problematic for smaller states to raise taxes above the level of similar states
3974318 the us is doing fairly well in maintaining its tax base really because we are so big california is also
3974319 if the proposed income tax increases are permanent then that would put us considerably out of whack
3974320 people dont move for taxes that are temporary and i dont think they will be permanent
3974321 this is a positive development as it brings the bank of canadas powers more in line with that of its peers and it reduces the risk of further credit market problems in canada
3974322 absolutely not brookfield and omers have a terrific relationship the building was and is 100 per cent leased omers decided they wanted to own 100 per cent and we found the price to be attractive
3974323 this sets a new benchmark price for rare trophy assets which simply dont come on the market that often
3974324 if in fact we had sold out our entire interest in the property i would have had mixed feelings but we still have a significant ownership interest in one of the best properties in canada if not north america
3974325 doing better will have to begin at the individual level
3974326 normally moving money out of a government in excess of the total taxes that year would be hard to do however i could use securities fraud i could issue a lot more government securities and government agency like mortgage agencies securities than i recorded on the government books and sell them abroad i would have to make sure not to publish audited financial statements as that would increase the liabilities of engaging in this kind of fraud it would help a lot if i could pool mortgages and sell government agency securities to finance those mortgages in a process where the same mortgage could be sold many times into the same pool
3974327 a thumbs up for raul castro the only world leader to my knowledge to speak truthfully i sure wish my govt was giving a heads up to my people
3974328 why would you put in a backstop of unlimited amounts of money if you werent going to need it
3974329 what is good about this bill is the fact that maybe it shores up fannie and freddie for a temporary basis
3974330 what it does not do is change the model of fannie and freddie it does not give the regulators the power to make the changes needed in freddie and fannie to make them viable entities for the future that is why i object
3974331 we are either going to spend zero or were going to spend a whole lot more than they are talking about
3974332 its clear that the democrats chose to play politics with the legislation and its unfortunate that theyre doing it with legislation that will prevent systemic risk to our financial system
3974333 a significant chance probably better than 50 percent that the proposed new treasury authority would not be used before it expired at the end of december 2009
3974334 this bill requires an emergency designation before one dollar of federal funding can be used
3974335 we are clearly facing an emergency situation and we must act now in order to secure the financial future of millions of homeowners
3974336 a key question becomes how does the market view the entities
3974337 they should close down fannie mae and freddie mac or what they should do is split them into 10 different companies and let them run as private companies
3974338 what freddie mac and fannie mae should right away do is not obtain any federal aid but issue additional shares
3974339 nobody is for everything thats in it or got everything in it he wanted but we negotiated a lot
3974340 its clear that the democrats chose to play politics with the legislation
3974341 we have been engaged in extensive and largely fruitful discussions with our counterparts in the house
3974342 its pretty good news a lot of people thought it would be much higher
3974343 i am as you can imagine pleased the house and senate reached an agreement on gse reform
3974344 very important to the capital markets broadly and to confidence in these institutions
3974345 we believe this is not the time for a prolonged veto fight but we are confident the president would prevail in one
3974346 nobody in america will agree with everything that is in this bill but i think enough people in america will find it acceptable so it will go to the presidents desk to be signed
3974347 wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover
3974348 the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3974349 and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because laura was over there trying to buy a house today
3974350 unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker shell be deciding thanks for the suggestion i suggest you dont yell it out when shes here
3974351 that description has been used for every market bubble in my memory
3974352 the president has made the point before that a lot of market participants were using very complicated financial instruments without fully understanding what the impact would be under stress
3974353 when we get to rate levels like this the market just shuts down
3974354 thats one of the ways in which the agencies can increase capital by slowing down their purchases
3974355 i dont think the market expects a dramatic slowdown in purchases but there clearly is uncertainty about that
3974356 i dont see how anyone could argue that the fundamentals of mortgages are not attractive
3974357 congress is going to have to recapitalize the fdic those 50 billion plus is not going to be enough by no means
3974358 i think that is something we need to factor into our premiums and charge higher premiums to banks that fit that profile
3974359 banks are going to pass it through to their customers through higher interest rates on loans lower interest on deposit
3974360 the deposit insurance fund is as real as the social security trust fund
3974361 any losses beyond that will be assessed on the banks
3974362 the 4 billion loss would drop the fund down to about 1 10 ratio
3974363 the fdic is going to be obligated of an increase in premiums to pay for that loss so the only monies that are available 2 843 billion in the fund of that 50 966 billion was not available
3974364 we are resetting expectations for bank profitability and we are re exploring what our expectations should be going forward
3974365 the market believed that this bad news was going to get dramatically worse quickly
3974366 the bad news is going to get dramatically worse but it will take time
3974367 weve gone from a credit crisis to a credit crunch
3974368 it could be more damaging to economy than it has so far
3974369 the likelihood that they will make good on the debt is much lower than it has been in the last five to 10 years
3974370 if we have significant unemployment or a recession that is what i would worry a lot about
3974371 so much of their business has been in the lower quality loans
3974372 these bottom line results are disappointing and unacceptable while to some degree they reflect industry headwinds and weaker macroeconomic conditions they also reflect performance for which we at wachovia accept responsibility
3974373 weve seen unprecedented carnage in this sector and there are no signs it is over
3974374 we would urge investors not to be too tempted in this area
3974375 we share the markets surprise at this move but believe any concern about the loss of a top tier rating will keep the shares under pressure
3974376 we are concerned by moodys announcement at a time when assured is experiencing broad market acceptance and investor demand for our insured paper
3974377 moodys action is not at all reflective of a deterioration in assureds capital base credit exposures or earnings outlook
3974378 such dramatic instability in the firms current and prospective market opportunity also raises questions about whether an aaa rating remains appropriate
3974379 i think the market just seems to be in complete shambles today
3974380 and i think its all precipitated by the two insurance companies plus the wachovia downgrade
3974381 i think some of the money market funds held the belief that fsa was going to be impervious to a downgrade thats not the case
3974382 although both companies fsa and ago have pledged to work to rebuild rating agency credibility municipal market advisors feels this may well be the end of bond insurance as we know it
3974383 credit lines have dried up and companies which might have been supported by extended credit up to a year ago are now at risk
3974384 were set to increase at a much faster rate in the later part of 2008 and in 2009
3974385 the small increase in defaults from the first to the second quarter may indicate that were nearing a plateau
3974386 we wont know until the end of the year but it may be that some lenders are starting to prioritize workouts with homeowners instead of grinding things through the foreclosure process
3974387 of course they may just be swamped and cant handle processing any more paperwork
3974388 the increased portion of homes lost to foreclosure reflects the slow real estate market as well as the number of homes bought during the height of the market with multiple loan financing which makes work outs difficult
3974389 another record low number of mortgages approved by the banks for house purchase means that the whole market is likely to be at its least active since the early 1990s
3974390 the pressure on household finances is being reflected in subdued consumer borrowing with spending on cards lower than of late and borrowing on personal loans and overdrafts being comparitively weak
3974391 the continuing lack of availability of mortgage finance is proving a major drag on the level of property transactions and is increasingly being felt in the real economy the modest cuts in the costs of borrowing seen over the past few weeks will unfortunately provide little relief for first time buyers indeed the fact that tim besley voted for a rate hike at the latest mpc meeting suggests that it is premature to expect the bank of england to provide any support anytime soon
3974392 it looks now as if there is a less than 50 percent change they will sell the business
3974393 if they didnt get the right price from zurich why would they get a better price from allstate
3974394 clearly rbs would have liked the flexibility but most investors would rather they didnt sell the business in a forced sale its not as if its a bad business and selling it would be dilutive to earnings
3974395 when you find yourself in a hole you have to quit digging
3974396 this is a critically important decision that will determine the future of biofuels in this country
3974397 congress takes that for granted that it makes me suspicious how is that in the best interest of the people they have been elected to represent
3974398 very very negative impact on the economy and thats very sure
3974399 could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and even detention
3974400 looking at the fdic and the hundreds of banks about to push dandelions its time to wonder what fannie and freddie are a dress rehearsal for
3974401 make a note on your calendar somewhere that what were seeing here may very well be a prequel to a bigger economic decline to come this fall and with that will come a major increase in blame

3974411 this just means much less credit availability for mortgage borrowers
3974412 they were teed up to be saviors of the mortgage crisis but now theyve got their own capital issues
3974413 mortgage losses are significant and will probably foster capital conservation from the agencies rather than portfolio growth
3974414 we are considering measures such as reducing or rebalancing risk limiting growth or reducing the size of our retained portfolio slowing purchases into our credit guarantee portfolio issuing additional preferred or convertible preferred stock issuing common stock and reducing the dividend on our common stock freddie mac said
3974415 the government may have to intervene through a capital infusion and in an extreme case scenario through taking on the agencies balance sheet
3974416 theres certainly fear among some investors that they might engage in large scale selling
3974417 problems there definitely matter since fannie has been one of the primary engines that finance the housing atm in yet another turn for the worse ofheo stated that it has identified additional policies that it believes appear inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles when i read this mornings ofheo headlines concerning fannies held for sale loans and use of fas 140 hedge accounting i thought this smells just like enron ergo my new nickname for fannie fanron
3974418 he said no one has lost a single penny on an insured deposit in the 75 years that the federal deposit insurance corporation has operated
3974419 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months
3974420 of course the list is going to grow longer given the stresses we have in the marketplace given the housing correction but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
3974421 were going through a challenging time with our economy this is a tough time the three big issues were facing right now are first the housing correction which is at the heart of the slowdown secondly turmoil of the capital markets and thirdly the high oil prices which are going to prolong the slowdown
3974422 but remember our economy has got very strong long term fundamentals solid fundamentals and you know your policy makers here regulators were being very vigilant
3974423 im very optimistic that were going to get what we need from congress here because congress understands how important these institutions are
3974424 our first priority today is the stability of the capital markets the stability of the system and these institutions have investors all around the world and those investors need to know that we in the united states of america understand the importance of these institutions to our capital markets and to our economy and to our housing market
3974425 im focused on this stimulus package its made a difference in the second quarter its going to make a difference in the third quarter we need to watch this very carefully
3974426 right now were going through a tough period there is no doubt about it but the stimulus plan is making a difference
3974427 small number of loans that appear to be fraudulent from inception
3974428 remains deeply concerned about consumer protection issues though these loans with relaxed lending standards were commonplace during this period time and experience has shown that the long term interests of borrowers were not always served well by them
3974429 no less than the international perception of the credit quality of the u s government is at stake
3974430 very optimistic that were going to get what we need from congress
3974431 investors that make the transition from u s treasuries to our securities will be pleased with the performance
3974432 designed to mirror that already used by the united states government
3974433 receive no funds from the federal government and the government does not guarantee their securities
3974434 have been promoting their debt securities as an alternative market benchmark
3974435 because we expect the u s government to step in if there is any problem
3974436 the banks are too big to fail and the man in the street is too small to bail
3974437 i predicted last summer that this would be my 10th bear market
3974438 but this one is different the others were more marketlike reflecting problems in the market not problems in the society and the economy as this one does as a result were in for a much more troublesome era than after the other big bear markets
3974439 i think we are going into recession and we are probably in one right now
3974440 we will probably have three or four quarters of negative growth but the risks are to the downside its not too late to stop it but we have to act right now monetary policy has been far too tight for too long we cant just sit and do nothing as we have done for too long
3974441 our job is to focus on inflation in the medium term so we have to look through the short term shock from oil and commodity prices
3974442 the economy is now slowing so fast we run the risk of writing a letter on the low side in the medium term
3974443 it is not the 1970s we dont have the union power that we saw then and people are fearful of losing their jobs so in my view there is no likelihood of wages taking off ive been saying this for 18 months and ive been right
3974444 the us has had a big stimulus but the uk has had none so the same things that have been happening in the us will happen in the uk but they could well be worse
3974445 both on the high street and in the housing market it is going to get a great deal worse before it gets better we have already seen a housing crisis that has morphed from a credit crunch to a general collapse in confidence as prices have tumbled
3974446 our worry is that without the usual medication from the bank of england which would have nasty inflationary side effects in this environment consumers will follow suit moving from their current state of denial into a state of despair
3974447 company directors seem to be saying we are doing okay at present but ask us again in three to six months and it could be hell out there
3974448 there are real difficulties in interpreting business confidence at the moment because there is a record gap between actual performance and future perceptions
3974449 the sharp fall in overall business optimism is very worrying and points towards a recession
3974450 other results in the survey suggest we can still escape with a sharp slowdown over 2008 9 the survey suggests the pressure on the corporate sector for a labour shake out is muted whether this situation will hold is the key uncertainty
3974451 both on the high street and in the housing market it will get a great deal worse before it gets better
3974452 our worry is that without the usual medication from the bank of england consumers will move from their current state of denial into a state of despair
3974453 as we have consistently warned both the consumer and the government have been living beyond their means for the last few years overborrowing on credit households will be lucky to see real disposable income growth of 1 per cent this year with repayments becoming more onerous rising inflation and sharp reversals in the housing and equity markets consumers are under increasing pressure
3974454 it has been conducted in the middle of a fierce financial storm we have seen unprecedented volatility in banking stocks
3974455 the bottom line is that we have raised 4 billion of capital
3974456 just like ships need more ballast in heavy seas banks need more capital in tougher times we have now raised that capital
3974457 from our perspective the key advantage of a rights issue is that all shareholders are treated in exactly the same way
3974458 it has never been more important for wto members to move forward on the doha development agenda
3974459 both developing and developed economies stand to gain from lower barriers to goods and agriculture
3974460 there are also great opportunities to expand trade among developing economies the so called south south trade which is expanding rapidly
3974461 that is the political bottom line nothing else will work for us nothing else will close the deal
3974462 we are prepared to offer more than others in this round but everyone must understand that we need something in return
3974463 seventy percent of the tariffs paid by developing countries are paid by other developing countries they arent paid by developed countries
3974464 if a lie is repeated enough times it becomes the truth
3974465 sense of anticipation a sense of momentum and a great desire to see a successful conclusion
3974466 because people expect nothing out of this week because when expectation is so low people are becoming more relaxed to negotiate
3974467 without the expectation of government support in a crisis such leverage would not be possible without a significantly higher cost of debt
3974468 do not appear needed to supply mortgage market liquidity or to enhance capital markets in the united states
3974469 before joining the public service carney had a thirteen year career with goldman sachs in its london tokyo new york and toronto offices
3974470 the goldman crowd is playing you for a bunch of fools and if you let them thats what you are
3974471 this coverage of live earth is brought to you by chevy
3974472 fyi the muse of the db seems to have gone a bit doomy of late and surprised by the speed of the financial implosion
3974473 we simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources by acting now we can control our future instead of letting the future control us jimmy carter speech to the nation 1977 you cant get elected by promising people less bill clinton 1998
3974474 it amuses me that theyre surprised on the drumbeat at the speed of the financial implosion i warned them specifically about that many times and tended to be ridiculed for my pains
3974475 coincidentally the ratio of fdics fund to the total amount of insured deposits is similar to the capital ratios set aside by fannie mae and freddie mac
3974476 i think that is something we need to factor into our premiums and charge higher premiums to banks that fit that profile
3974477 this solution however extreme it may seem is preferable to allowing the economic function these institutions serve to collapse
3974478 additionally if the creditworthiness of their debt were to come into question it could lead to a loss of confidence in the u s financial markets more broadly
3974479 the recent weakness in the u s dollar indicates a pullback in overseas demand for u s securities a situation that will not be resolved until the treasurys plan for the stabilization of fannie mae and freddie mac becomes clearer and the free fall of financial sector equities is arrested
3974480 loss of confidence in the safety and soundness of this countrys banking industry
3974481 the emergency order could further exacerbate a loss of confidence in the safety and soundness of this countrys banking industry
3974482 as the commission is aware it would be an understatement to say that short interest in financial services companies has greatly increased over the year
3974483 this wreaked havoc on the securities lending market but the effect was completely temporary
3974484 its important for fannie mae and freddie mac bonds and stocks to rise so they can keep raising capital and aid the mortgage market
3974485 to facilitate customer orders in a fast moving market without possible delays
3974486 the number of holes in the balance sheets frightens me
3974487 there are 8 000 banks in america and most people havent heard of 7 950 of them
3974488 i was a relative optimist but ive certainly become more pessimistic
3974489 the financial system looks substantially worse now than it did a month ago if the freddie and fannie bailout were to fail it could get a hell of a lot worse if we get more bank failures we have the possibility of seeing more of these pictures of people standing in line to pull their money out that could really scare consumers
3974490 we havent seen this kind of travail in the financial markets since the 1930s
3974491 you have another wave of anxiety another tightening of credit
3974492 the idea that well have a second half of the year recovery has gone by the boards
3974493 i feel very confident and optimistic that theres broad based support for moving quickly to get the reform done and id be very optimistic that we would get it done some time next week
3974494 in the long run proved universally either burdensome or useless
3974495 but what good is it if no other institution will accept it
3974496 but depending on the specifics funds will be subject to an extended hold period
3974497 people could be taking advantage of this situation by creating fraudulent checks
3974498 we field too many questions on when the recession began and when we expect it to end all for trying to time the optimal date to leap back into the equity market
3974499 we are nervous that we have ended up following in japans footsteps due to the inept fiscal response to the problem
3974500 a temporary tax rebate from uncle sam to buy ipods tackles a real estate deflation and credit crunch as effectively as the ldps liberal democratic party solution in the early 1990s to build bridges and pave river beds that nobody needed
3974501 the cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
3974502 with the consumer likely on the verge of the first recession in 18 years we believe that a large and deflationary gap is in the cards the largest deflationary impulse unleashed in the economy since the early 1980s
3974503 it did a lot of good things and got into things it shouldnt have
3974504 but it was very instrumental in removing a lot of the imperfections that existed in the mortgage and credit markets
3974505 freddie and fannie are private companies with government support thats the worst possible scenario because you have institutions who have every incentive to maximize profit with guarantees from moral hazard
3974506 the reason you wont find cmhc running into the same problems is because cmhc does not have the structure to go into portfolio trading and doesnt have the private sector incentive for profit maximization
3974507 they shouldnt be out there competing or discouraging private sector participation because when you have a mixture of public sector and private sector functions intermixed you will inevitably end up with what the americans have in freddie mac and fannie mae
3974508 they are again enticing people into mortgages without a theoretical perspective as to why they should be artificially stimulating housing demand
3974509 improved the supply of low cost mortgage funds in canada
3974510 if you did get rid of cmhc who would securitize the mortgages
3974511 would you trust one of the investment arms of the big banks to securitizing the mortgages they hold
3974512 provides an incredible platform to promote our world class brand enhance our relationship with current clients attract new clients and expand our considerable community efforts
3974513 theyre very excited about the relationship and enthusiastic about being our partner as we get ready to open the ballpark with their name
3974514 were confident and ecstatic about having them as our partner
3974515 they will have to clearly articulate to their shareholders why this will drive their business going forward
3974516 they have to demonstrate that they will get a return on their investment and not be sheepish about it
3974517 youre not closing a deal if youre citi only because your name is on the field
3974518 but doing business there and the relationship with the mets might lead to a deal
3974519 stable and dynamic institution that is thriving in a very challenging marketplace
3974520 barclays is fully committed to its relationship with the nets
3974521 as of december 2007 currency in circulation that is u s coins and paper currency in the hands of the public totaled about 829 billion dollars
3974522 your comments on inflation deflation reveal that it is literally impossible to discuss economics in any clear way today
3974523 just two generations ago america was a nation of mostly thrifty people living within their means
3974524 by contrast the nations savings rate which exceeded 8 percent of disposable income in 1968 stood at 0
3974525 is it worth correcting people every time they use the word
3974526 ok since were still talking about inflation ill ask my question again because i still havent read or at least understood the answer
3974527 as of december 2007 currency in circulation that is u s coins and paper currency in the hands of the public totaled about 829 billion dollars
3974528 give me the power to control a nations currency and i care not who makes its laws
3974529 they have really hollowed out the government which is a real problem for whoever takes over after them because i think the next president is really entering a hollow house it still looks like a government they can still play a government on tv but you pull back the curtain everything is outsourced everything is privatized
3974530 this is about not only our housing markets but its about our capital markets more broadly
3974531 this goes well beyond the two institutions fannie and freddie it has to do with investors in the united states and investors all over the world
3974532 i am confident they recognize the demands of the current situation and will act to complete work on this legislation this week
3974533 we must in the short term take steps to boost confidence
3974534 ofheo has told us one thing and the markets have told us another
3974535 the more flexibility we have on the credit facility the more confidence you have in the market and the greater protection to the taxpayer because the less likely it will be used
3974536 something like that shouldnt have to be used its like the feds lender of last resort facility
3974537 significantly increased their exposure to fair value losses from changes in market prices
3974538 to the extent that those institutions recognize fair value losses on their private label portfolios under gaap fannie mae and freddie mac may have to do so as well
3974539 the exposure at freddie mac is about twice that at fannie mae
3974540 i believe that the united states is on the right path to resolving market disruptions and building a stronger financial system
3974541 i am well aware that financial market and housing challenges continue to concern americas families progress will not come in a straight line and we need to remain patient as we work through these challenges
3974542 but i am playing the hand that i have been dealt
3974543 there is a significant chance probably better than 50 percent that the proposed new treasury authority would not be used before it expired at the end of december 2009
3974544 we need to act in the short term because the gses are vital institutions in our capital markets today and are vital to emerging from the housing correction
3974545 this is a very very difficult thing to do and of course the political pressure will be great to make the cost estimate zero
3974546 you can make a reasoned argument that it will be zero with some probability but of course its also with some probability it could be very costly to taxpayers
3974547 the federal reserve is working with ofheo to get a better understanding of the issues facing the gses
3974548 until the housing market stabilizes further we should expect some continued stresses in our financial markets
3974549 the new law will not give the regulator either the mandate or the capacity of a bank regulator
3974550 the new law creates a cumbersome regulatory process to implement many parts of the bill
3974551 im afraid we will need to revisit the issue of the proper regulatory framework for the companies
3974552 you know the second part of this is having a strong regulator with real teeth with real responsibilities and powers
3974553 and this is going to be key to putting us in a position where we can address the risks that they pose and that have been focused on but our first priority today is the stability of the capital markets
3974554 all i can say at this point is we dont intend to guarantee the public debt
3974555 the market needs to come to terms with the fact that when financial institutions take over other financials especially in a rescue the decision to not guarantee does not imply that bank of america will walk away from the liabilities
3974556 todays statement was i think aimed at limiting damage to bank of americas investors
3974557 this is steels chance as the new guy to set the bar low so that he can increase the dividend going forward if their performance improves
3974558 shorts have come a long way they are getting into the mainstream and long holders need to understand the shorts are not evil
3974559 short sellers are a very important part of the ecosystem of our financial markets
3974560 the same way that lions go after a herd they go after the weaker animals the shorts will pick on a company where theres a legitimate controversy over its valuation
3974561 severe volatility in the shares of companies conducting rights issues
3974562 the market is becoming a market for speculators rather than a market for investors
3974563 these guys are making fat profits out of these market maneuvers it should be restricted to a very limited level of market cap otherwise it becomes market manipulation
3974564 the sec is trying to send a message i am again not quite sure what the message is
3974565 i am just not sure that this was an issue at all for the equity prices of these companies
3974566 its understandable that the u s consumer would be apprehensive with the circumstances weakness in housing gasoline is up the stock market is down and job insecurity
3974567 we may actually have a consumer led recession which is rare
3974568 if you look at energy prices and things like that its not any big surprise the consumer has been cautious
3974569 its a splash of cold water on the theory that earnings will bounce back quickly
3974570 we have 1 trillion on our balance sheet there are in fact other options you guys never heard of fds and there are other options on our balance sheet
3974571 we will need to reverse course the exact timing depends on how the economy evolves but i anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than later
3974572 it will likely need to begin before either the labor market or the financial markets have completely turned around
3974573 monetary policy cannot control changes in the relative price of a key commodity like oil or food
3974574 but it can help ensure that a relative price increase doesnt turn into a rise in overall inflation
3974575 we cant wait until we clearly observe the financial markets at normal the economy growing robustly and so on and so forth before we reverse course
3974576 they want to start laying the ground for eventual rate hikes to come
3974577 the market is becoming speculative and what is happening is that the big players are distorting the market one of the ways of doing this is by shorting
3974578 non negligible contributions so that over 10 years the scheme would build up a fund of several billions of pounds
3974579 i think its rather short sighted that the banks shouldnt put up money now if you wait until theres a problem thats a bad time to ask
3974580 pay a contribution which reflects the riskiness of the bank
3974581 i dont think its a good idea to offer 100pc protection up to a level without an element of risk based premia and some degree of pre funding
3974582 i think they should be given a few years so as not to impose excessive cost
3974583 would have preferred a regime where the bank would have had the power to pull the trigger on a failing lender but the treasury decided to take a different course
3974584 there are some countries that suffer from weak institutions where central banks have not been proactively fighting inflation and sentiment has deteriorated
3974585 its going to be a more challenging environment for emerging markets as youre going to see less portfolio flows
3974586 people are focusing more on the domestic fundamentals like fiscal and monetary policy credibility in the past there was less differentiation
3974587 the shock of higher food and energy costs has exposed the major shortcomings of emerging economies in controlling inflation
3974588 im not sure emerging markets will respond to inflation shocks
3974589 over the past few years people from goldman sachs have assumed control over large parts of the federal government
3974590 over the next few they might just take over the whole darn thing
3974591 we were taught in economics 101 that countries could not for long sustain large ever growing trade deficits our country has been behaving like an extraordinarily rich family that possesses an immense farm
3974592 if you put 10 000 in the market in march of 2000 when the dow peaked at 11 722 how much money would you have today if the markets 10 under 11 722
3974593 im shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
3974594 evolutionary science provides the simplest explanation of human behavior that fits the physical facts
3974595 they are the best we could find given the circumstances
3974596 scratch a cynic and youll find a person who made the mistake of letting their ideals become their expectations
3974597 just put me in the multiple listing service back then it might have been referred
3974598 i like the way he goes about everything he has power on base skills and dont forget that hes a 60 on the 20 to 80 scouting scale runner as well his defense is adequate but i think hes the kind of guy who is an everyday corner outfielder on a first division team he could be pretty special
3974599 we dont tell heroin addicts if you stay clean all week you can reward yourself by shooting up a small amount on the weekend
3974600 the most difficult part of maintaining weight loss is sticking to what got you there
3974601 when the weight is gone its hard not to think hey i deserve dessert tonight or a bag of chips with lunch today
3974602 people lose weight all the time but keeping it off seems to be the difficult part
3974603 were really more interested in weight maintenance than in initial weight loss
3974604 other studies report that physical activity is the best predictor of long term weight maintenance
3974605 this agrees with what our registry people are telling us
3974606 theyre always watching for changes and respond to them quickly
3974607 but it doesnt mean that if you have a weight problem you dont have control its harder for certain people than for others that may be where genes and physiology come in
3974608 people who have maintained their weight loss for three to five years say it gets easier
3974609 i find the reward for remaining vigilant in the long run is much greater than the short term gratification of indulging
3974610 esperamos conseguir m s xitos de los que hemos conseguido
3974611 lo siento por la gente de espa a y de pinto que sent a c mo me empujaban
3974612 la contrarreloj no es mi especialidad pero voy a m s estoy satisfecho
3974613 mi objetivo es mantener el estilo de este grupo desarrollarlo y potenciarlo porque es un grupo ganador lo m s importante no ha sido lo que ha ganado en la eurocopa sino c mo lo ha conseguido c mo ha disfrutado con ello y c mo lo ha transmitido
3974614 edmilson sigue con una fuerte amigdalitis por lo que hay que esperar 24 48 horas para que desaparezcan las molestias
3974615 eso dificulta bastante su posible concurso en el carranza por lo que de los jugadores que tenemos con problemas es el que est casi descartado para estos partidos
3974616 ojal podamos mantener el nivel del a o pasado tanto en lo individual como en lo colectivo el a o pasado estuvimos ah arriba peleando por el t tulo y me gustar a mantenernos ah arriba
3974617 la verdad que ser campe n de europa ha sido algo espectacular y todos los d as notamos la repercusi n que ha tenido en la gente es algo que nos pone muy contentos por haber participado en ello y haberles dado una alegr a como esa en lo personal me halaga que la gente espere tanto de m es una responsabilidad para la que creo que estoy preparado y por ello no me importa
3974618 soy consciente de que puedo mejorar y poder jugar muchos minutos aunque este a o hay mucha calidad y cada a o la competencia es mucho mayor
3974619 son todos grandes futbolistas y que hace dif cil jugar aunque creo que eso es bueno tanto para el equipo que mejora como para nosotros que nos ayuda tambi n a mejorar y a luchar todav a m s
3974620 la pude jugar la otra vez y disput dos encuentros y poder volver a jugarla es algo que me motiva mucho
3974621 ganar un titulo para el villarreal es algo muy dif cil y m s en una competici n como la espa ola y en la liga de campeones hay grandes equipos que est n llamados a estar arriba y ser favoritos equipos como madrid barcelona sevilla valencia o atl tico de madrid siempre tienen que estar arriba
3974622 pero nosotros tambi n tenemos un buen equipo de mucha calidad como para poder estar ah peleando con ellos y disputar con igualdad esa es la ilusi n y por ello vamos a pelearlo vamos a luchar con humildad y en la l nea del a o pasado
3974623 no estamos teniendo mucha suerte unas veces por mi precipitaci n y otras por mala suerte
3974624 la convicci n de que se van a solucionar los puntos
3974625 al igual que nosotros el real madrid tambi n esta en fase de rodaje a n porque no llevamos ni un mes de pretemporada por lo que creo que va a ser una eliminatoria igualada f sicamente los equipos van a llegar bastante parejos al partido del domingo
3974626 estoy contento de haber jugado en mestalla porque es la primera vez que lo hago con la camiseta del valencia ya que la pasada temporada jugu aqu pero con la del getafe
3974627 poco a poco nos vamos compenetrando mejor y cogiendo los conceptos que quiere emery y eso es a base de partidos y minutos llevamos cuatro encuentros jugados y ahora tenemos una eliminatoria complicada con el real madrid con la supercopa que supone la disputa de un t tulo para tambi n nos sirve de preparaci n de cara a la liga
3974628 el a o que he pasado en el c diz no ha sido nada bueno ya tuve la posibilidad de venir la temporada pasada pero no pudo ser quiz s ahora no sea el mejor momento ni para el club ni para m pero espero que salga todo bien y si es necesario daremos el 200 por cien para que el levante vuelva donde se merece
3974629 que parte de cero y quiere hacer las cosas bien
3974630 fui a c diz con un proyecto importante pero las cosas no salieron bien a lo mejor ahora las cosas no pintan nada favorables en el levante pero no se sabe lo que puede pasar en el levante partimos de cero y creo que va a ser todo positivo
3974631 el levante me ha ofrecido la oportunidad del volver a casa y estoy muy contento y dispuesto a trabajar y darlo todo por el club
3974632 si el grupo est unido y se hace un buen trabajo esto se puede sacar adelante
3974633 calidad al centro del campo y en las acciones a bal n parado
3974634 voy partido a partido y cada uno de ellos es complicado y muy importante porque aparte de por m estoy jugando por mi pa s y eso es una motivaci n extra por eso cuanto m s lejos llegue mejor aunque no logre medalla por eso estoy feliz por haber alcanzado los cuartos de final
3974635 es dif cil de explicar el cambio desde que llegu hasta ahora no se puede valorar es un cambio muy radical el primer d a no era valorable porque sufr a el cambio horario y cansancio con muchos partidos pero en competici n todo es distinto
3974636 la cabeza vuelve a estar en marcha en cuanto empiezan los partidos en los encuentros inconscientemente te preparas para competir mentalmente necesitaba un par n no entren muy bien pero cada d a me encontraba algo mejor y cuando empez la competici n ya me encontr mejor que cuando entrenaba los primeros d as me faltaba una semana
3974637 creo que est al cincuenta por ciento nosotros hemos jugado menos partidos y eso es lo que te da el ritmo pero no se puede decir quien esta mejor o peor
3974638 un gran jugador y una gran persona del mismo modo que lo es david villa o ngel javier arizmendi
3974639 sabemos que silva y villa son dos grandes jugadores que pueden salir de aqu pero nos gustar a que se quedasen porque son parte del valencianismo y esperemos que sigan
3974640 perder amos a una gran persona y a un gran jugador pero la entrada y salida de jugadores es lo que hay en el f tbol
3974641 ahora venimos a entrenar con ganas nos gusta mucho entrenar con l los entrenamientos son divertidos y todo el equipo est encantado con l porque venimos contentos a entrenar
3974642 si es bueno es igual que sea brasile o o canadiense ltimamente en brasil hay buenos porteros
3974643 las dos partes quer an llegar a un acuerdo y al final se ha producido de manera satisfactoria tanto el jugador como nosotros quer amos que siguiera muchos a os defendiendo al valencia y al final hemos llegado a un acuerdo que se preve a por las intenciones de ambas partes
3974644 lo que nos deja a todos muy contentos a todos es anunciar que el acuerdo es total para el jugador ha sido una decisi n muy importante y hay que recalcar el esfuerzo del valencia por mantener en su plantilla a un jugador como silva
3974645 la predisposici n del jugador y sus agentes por quedarse con nosotros
3974646 papel relevante del presidente para que el futbolista continuara aqu
3974647 los jugadores echamos ra ces y aqu silva se siente importante a pesar de las posibilidades que pueda tener quiere seguir con nosotros y queremos agradec rselo
3974648 el club ha llegado hasta donde ha podido y el jugador ha bajado tambi n hasta donde consideraba necesario
3974649 el valencia tiene muy claro que tipo de gesti n quiere llevar a cabo y no va acometer locuras ni se va a salir de las l neas generales para la estructura econ mica y deportiva actual ni para el futuro
3974650 si silva hubiera salido del valencia hubiera tenido donde elegir

3974652 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

3974656 proxy any file used to temporarily replace a footage item but most often a lower resolution or still version of an existing footage item used to replace the original often storyboard images are used as proxies you can use a proxy either before you have the final footage or when you have the actual footage item but you want to speed up previewing or rendering of test movies you must have a file available to use as a proxy any masks attributes expressions effects and keyframes that you apply to the layer are retained when you replace its placeholder or proxy with the final footage item
3974657 scientific studies have found that having sex actually increases testosterone levels
3974658 but obviously before a big competition you want rest rest is different for everyone some need more mental rest and if sex gives them that then fine
3974659 if its physical rest i dont think sex with the calories used will make a difference but if you stay up all night to get it done then thats a different story

3974733 a gannett publisher in maryland told employees late this afternoon that gci is eliminating 1 000 newspaper jobs or about 3 of the newspaper divisions workforce and that about 600 employees are being laid off a gannett blog reader says
3974734 the reader provided a copy of a memo that daily times publisher rick jensen appears to have e mailed employees at the salisbury md paper at about 4 p m today across gannetts community publishing division about 1 000 positions will be eliminated about 3 of the workforce of the 1 000 positions about 600 employees will be laid off the memo says
3974735 the copy of the memo provided to me does not say whether every newspaper would reduce employment by 3 or whether the rates might instead vary by business within whats now called the u s community publishing division the memo also doesnt give a timetable for these division wide cuts
3974736 several gci papers have already made recent job cuts but at a higher rate 5
3974737 jensen apparently mentioned the broad cuts in an e mail meant to tell his own employees that some of them would be losing their jobs as soon as next week the e mail provided to me says
3974738 were being faced with another difficult round of position reductions because of the continuing decline in economic conditions the e mail says
3974739 gannett has set payroll expense reduction targets for us and all other newspapers in the u s community publishing division necessitating the reduction in positions the targets were set based on our financial performance and previous reductions
3974740 the e mail continues our position reduction plan is now at corporate for review we expect to receive final approval by monday and affected employees will be notified by next thursday

3974785 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
3974786 when you look across the medal opportunities its been driven by the track and it is absolutely the best british team
3974787 everyone thinks were just going to show up and win it its going to be a close call
3974788 the danes have stepped up theyve been training at altitude theyve gone all out and taken some risks if it pays off theyre going to be fantastic
3974789 when youve been training for the last four years for this one event to have the goal posts moved like that and youre no longer aiming at a time you thought you were aiming for but at a time that nobodys ever gone faster than before
3974790 if we were to increase the gap by even a second or two this problem would not have arisen
3974791 enough of a success given that it provides us with the data to go operational
3974792 i used do lots of crazy stuff like fly a fighter plane and drive a mclaren f1
3974793 the suppression of black people just didnt seem like a really good way to spend time
3974794 if someone with a particular purpose in mind enters the area that things will happen
3974795 fundamentally with an eye towards extension of life to multiple planets the really important goal in space more important than the sum of everything else
3974796 im extremely optimistic about earth and i think its highly likely to be a great place to live for a long time but not completely likely
3974797 100 years ago there was no atomic bomb who knows what the next 100 years will bring some unknown threats that we could invent to bring about self annihilation then theres also the chance of a super volcano or big meteorite
3974798 before proceeding to study applications that may not make physical sense
3974799 one should differentiate between an isomer programme and what might be called the hafnium programme
3974800 the former has added significantly to the body of science as documented by many peer reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community
3974801 the hafnium program was focused to my knowledge on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and sceptical group it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping yet distinct programmes with quite different aims and outcomes
3974802 this approach differs dramatically from suggestions for use of isomeric materials in explosives applications
3974803 this process requires a resonance between the nuclear and atomic electron transition energies
3974804 in principle these might be adjusted within a high temperature plasma to bring an appropriate atomic transition into resonance with the nucleus
3974805 a secondary role of awe is to provide independent advice to the uk government on potential threats to the security of the uk so an understanding of the fundamentals of isomer physics is essential
3974806 are picking big business brands standing high in public regard
3974807 with the economy weakening and in the teeth of a recession john will keep taxes low create incentives to grow jobs and help small businesses
3974808 actually is more of the same failed bush policies of cutting taxes for high income people and big corporations
3974809 obamas economic plan is geared toward getting the economy going again and easing the struggle of ordinary americans
3974810 both mccain and obama are listening to us probably because we have plants in key states like michigan and ohio
3974811 frequently i have to debunk the misconceptions some people have
3974812 en realidad el agua no sabe cu ntos a os tienes de modo que en verdad ese dato no importa cuando entras a la piscina
3974813 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
3974814 both national and state elections due in a few months political parties and separatist groups are inciting the violence and using the dispute to fuel their own political agendas
3974815 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe
3974816 i am disappointed that they have stepped away from this i know that there are practical difficulties and that there were matters of principle that the fashion industry found difficult but i feel the bfc should show leadership on this issue
3974817 i feel that to ask all models to produce a mandatory certificate of health compromises their dignity and potentially infringes their human rights

3974885 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3974886 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3974887 any civilised country would act same way i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction

3974914 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3974917 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

3974926 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
3974927 here god take the best of my possessions as my worship
3974928 i dont want the best of your possessions i want the best of who you are i just want you
3974929 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3974930 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3974931 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3974932 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
3974933 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
3974934 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
3974935 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
3974936 i think youll find that this is the real deal
3974937 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3974938 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3974939 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3974940 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3974941 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3974942 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3974943 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3974944 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
3974945 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
3974946 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
3974947 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3974948 id love to if i can find the right movie
3974949 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3974950 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3974951 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
3974952 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
3974953 that home run gave us confidence and even lupe too
3974954 he was struggling a little bit on the two runs they got on him he got stronger and stronger as the game went on
3974955 its awesome it feels great it was awesome to beat puerto rico 12 2 to win everything
3974956 when the game started we were excited to play them in the championship and then to win it its everything
3974957 it means we can do it if we come ready to play
3974958 baseball is a sport where you can win it if you play right
3974959 i think its great hopefully more players more teams get there maybe more often
3974960 i dont think mcallen teams have ever done that maybe we can get a couple more teams
3974961 its fun it keeps me from being bored and stuff since i dont play basketball now
3974962 when i see them working out hope thats what i see in their eyes hope
3974963 i love that i can fight go places take long trips to fight and the medals that you get
3974964 its keeping them off the streets thats the main reason second i recognize his skills i know hes gonna become a champ one day
3974965 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3974966 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3974967 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3974968 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3974969 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3974970 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3974971 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3974972 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3974973 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3974974 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3974975 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3974976 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3974977 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3974978 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3974979 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3974980 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
3974981 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
3974982 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
3974983 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
3974984 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
3974985 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
3974986 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
3974987 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
3974988 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3974989 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3974990 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3974991 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3974992 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3974993 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
3974994 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
3974995 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
3974996 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
3974997 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
3974998 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
3974999 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
3975000 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
3975001 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
3975002 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3975003 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3975004 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
3975005 who are you how many hit records do you have
3975006 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor
3975007 when you go to eat at a stuckeys family restaurant and one of the girls from dream is your server do you tip her 20 percent or just the standard 15
3975008 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
3975009 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3975010 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
3975011 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
3975012 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
3975013 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3975014 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
3975015 there is a great deal of confusion about what they can do
3975016 some lobbying firms have decided not to go to either of the conventions
3975017 while we have been active at political conventions in the past we dont have any plans at this point for the upcoming convention
3975018 if you are having a reception it has to be light appetizers no forks just toothpicks
3975019 i think this is preposterous frankly because i dont think it is the genesis of the problem the people who brought us this whole regulatory regime intend to interrupt the normal social interaction between and among those who do business together
3975020 it might sound a little ridiculous but the intent was to stop the one on one sit down dinners between a lobbyist and lawmakers which was the trade of currency of jack abramoff who is now in prison for bribing members of congress
3975021 in general under minnesota law legislators and constitutional officers cannot take gifts from registered lobbyists
3975022 we have been working with our legal counsel at faegre amp benson
3975023 the really bigger issue is not so much whether or not a congressman is going to stuff his face with shrimp on a toothpick
3975024 an incredibly good opportunity for lobbyists and special interests to really mingle with members of congress and have serious face time with them
3975025 when we find out we will have the clients legal counsel review it to make sure everything passes muster
3975026 snake overcame a severely broken leg at raynham park and now lives with a loving family in taunton
3975027 he helped his adoptive family collect hundreds of signatures for question 3 their commitment and hard work demonstrates the true grassroots nature of the yes on 3 campaign
3975028 dogs play an important role in our lives and in our families and they deserve to be protected
3975029 we are confident that once voters see the face of greyhound racing they will vote yes on 3 to protect mans best friend from cruelty and abuse
3975030 to see him truly enjoying the life he is living now the life he should have lived all along
3975031 transfers of manpower and resources including activation and reassignment of units shall be halted
3975032 i am surprised but not that surprised given the turmoil in the air force
3975033 it makes sense for new leadership to want to pause and evaluate major projects like cyber command before moving forward the air force is facing severe challenges right now so leadership may want to consolidate its resources before expanding the af cybermission
3975034 protection and defense of the air forces command and control abilities
3975035 mission is to control cyberspace both for attacks and defense
3975036 as airmen it is our calling to dominate air space and cyberspace
3975037 izarra encabezar el equipo t cnico de campa a acompa ado por los directores de los canales de televisi n y de la radio oficiales
3975038 la campa a electoral se va a hacer no sobre la venta de la imagen del candidato sino sobre lo que ha realizado este gobierno en favor de los sectores populares y lo que piensa seguir realizando
3975039 the worst thing we can do is be in a hurry
3975040 its better to do it right than fast where more could get injured
3975041 its a complicated situation but weve determined that saving houses did not outweigh the casualty risk
3975042 im pissed off that ive been out here for 13 hours and havent got to search
3975043 but at the same time if its that bad its better to do what theyre doing
3975044 i always hear soldiers dogging the air force but they sure are quick to call in close air support from air force jets
3975045 many youths carrying various types of dangerous weapons have started grouping themselves for further action over the issue before the police and hisbah men dispersed them
3975046 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3975047 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3975048 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
3975049 they just feel like its a bad deal that the comments that were made by mayor lance pyle and our police officer could have been handled differently
3975050 if people are that upset and they have to walk then well rebuild the department and in the meantime ill make sure the citizens have coverage for emergency situations
3975051 but i will not back down on the request i made to have this firefighter on suspension pending the outcome of the court case s
3975052 the major thing here is that we acted by our guidelines
3975053 and that melrose fire department guidelines are different than the police department and village departments because we are not paid employees we are volunteers you cant fire a volunteer where you can fire an employee
3975054 we dont feel like we did anything wrong besides support a young man that wanted to help himself and do whats right
3975055 he has come to me every time and let me know what was going on he has been forthright with me every time and everything he has said to me has had merit he has been nothing but a very good volunteer for us
3975056 inilah kali pertama esb memisahkan bahagian menara dengan cahaya empat negara berasingan dalam sejarahnya
3975057 berlatih dan berusaha sepanjang hayat mereka untuk berjaya ke arena pertandingan antarabangsa di mana perpaduan dan semangat kesukanan adalah dihormati
3975058 arent you supposed to tell me how much gel to use
3975059 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3975060 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3975061 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3975062 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3975063 a man the other day pointed out that i was never bored i hadnt thought of that before but its true im never bored im appalled horrified angered but never bored the world appears to me so infinite in its variety that many lifetimes could not exhaust its interest so long as you can still be surprised you have something to be thankful for
3975064 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread

3975067 the unique community coming in i dont think theyre used to the farm life
3975068 i think the residential is starting to overpower the farmer
3975069 i kinda like them i thought about putting christmas lights on them
3975070 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3975071 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3975072 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3975073 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3975074 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3975075 as a stealth radical liberal who has tried to cover up extensive connections to islam and questioning whether his admitted experimentation with drugs in high school and college ever ceased
3975076 was not designed to be and does not set out to be a political book
3975077 we are excited at the prospect of being able to focus on two such rich and diverse publishing industries
3975078 the london book fair will provide great opportunity to our publishers and also to old and new emerging authors to showcase their latest titles and highlight the progress made in india in the book publishing industry
3975079 government of the government by the government and for the government
3975080 the diver and the camera drop at the same time
3975081 it makes you marvel at what these athletes will do we were thinking what must it be like to plummet from that height how can we capture the sensation
3975082 one of those lovely problems that keep you up at 4 a m building things in your mind
3975083 make you feel like you were in a race car looking sideways heading into the water
3975084 handstands are hardest divers go up a bit first you have to take the rope up then let go some people pick this up straight away others cant do it at all
3975085 all of these internet channels have given bands more of a reason to make a video because they can instantly upload to a place where their fans can see it and there is at least a chance someone else will see it
3975086 everyone knows making music is one of the most amazingly fun things you can do with your time and making a video is just another part of that it might be vain or silly or hard to justify in terms of how much it can cost and where it actually pushes a bands career but thats all shifting and negligible anyway
3975087 has to be an extension of creativity producing something to be a promotional tool is transparent as hell i think that its a great way to close the gap between band and audience because a video is the band in person its very human and inviting
3975088 we wanted to add value to the release and including videos is a good way to do that it was also interesting because even though they are our songs the tunes had been reworked by the remixers to a point that we could approach them from a fresh perspective it was sort of like doing videos for someone else as opposed to us it was a good opportunity to get various friends and band members involved with shooting illustrating animating editing them
3975089 the song is sort of vignettes of the apocalypse and the director don tyler interpreted the lyrics into this kind of drugged out shotgun wedding in the garden of eden thing orchestrated by a maestro with a head made of cotton
3975090 and westlands javelins both a part of ann arbor based label collective like to keep it simple
3975091 we actually had no aspirations to do one but someone came to us with a cool idea that was free so we said yeah
3975092 the pop project likes jokes so we made a video to showcase that
3975093 wherever the industry is in 5 years it will be different but still around
3975094 it is a long weekend as well so investors will stay cautious
3975095 people are really coming to this area to go shopping because bethesda had never been thought of a fashion destination before
3975096 people sit outside for fine dining locals walk their dogs and window shop and couples or families sit on the benches eating gelato
3975097 i was also excited to see that they had churros because they are hard to find
3975098 the concerts have drawn a lot of foot traffic to the bethesda lane shops
3975099 commercial whole loans are difficult or impossible to hedge and knowledgeable players in the commercial mortgage market are attempting to sell their positions while they still can so we may be seeing a sequel to august 2007 but without the fraudulent borrowers and without the no money down issues
3975100 one of the few financial firms that are playing offense and showing revenue growth
3975101 of course there will be corrections along the way this is normal because no market goes straight up thats whats happening now but recognize that these downmoves are corrections within the mega uptrends
3975102 if that were to change however wed change with it wed have to because its a huge mistake to go against the major trends
3975103 as we write for one of the first times in seven years gold is seriously testing its major trend
3975104 keep in mind our maximum downside target has been the 65 week moving average based on timing august is also a normal time for a low plus considering the oversold nature in most metals and shares it looks like the worst is at hand rather than this being the start of a bear market
3975105 nevertheless we have to be cautious this may be a great buying opportunity but we also have to be prepared to make a change if thats what the market tells us
3975106 if we are really in a pearl harbor moment then we have to figure out a way to do it
3975107 we just have to design vehicles for convergence and gear up battery and motor manufacturing
3975108 its like adding a second smaller electric fuel tank to the car
3975109 the problem we are looking at is this installed base
3975110 the problem i am finding is that battery technology is still not there
3975111 it depends on how deep are the pockets of the customer
3975112 you can do the full conversion and get 100 miles on the charge
3975113 if we had a mixed environment thats a good thing
3975114 id come from cleveland where i was playing in more sort of new wave bands so my vocal style just wasnt d c hardcore
3975115 at first we thought it sounded horrible you got your chocolate in my peanut butter type of thing but then it wound up being this really great reeses peanut butter cup and it tasted real good
3975116 by the time we made pony express record everybody in the band was on exactly the same page
3975117 so it created this really singular sounding and feeling thing and i think that was the last moment where that happened in shudder to think
3975118 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3975119 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3975120 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3975121 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
3975122 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3975123 about as impressive a case as ive seen a vp candidate make for himself
3975124 i love bill clinton but can you imagine being vice president im not looking for a ceremonial post
3975125 in a barack administration id probably be looked to a whole lot more
3975126 now i dont think he would ask me but i think he would look to me more
3975127 if the presidential nominee thought that i could help him win
3975128 im not going to say to the first african american candidate about to make history in the world no i will not help you
3975129 biden has been critical of bushs approach to iraq and the world for the right reasons and from the beginning
3975130 republicans are strong on national security and voters needed to be convinced of their failures and then led to a place of support for a democratic alternative
3975131 from the position that republicans have been catastrophic failures on foreign policy and their ongoing claims to competence and leadership should be laughed at
3975132 rudy giuliani is probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency
3975133 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
3975134 they claim the innovations of brian eno without his ambitions and that means that something once outsider ish and vaguely transgressive is now so mainstream as to be on soft rock radio and that must surely bother early eno adopters
3975135 evokes a glassy eyed fish on a fishmongers slab ice melting from its scales
3975136 actually sounds as if hes trying very hard to suppress his arrogance and near american showoffiness
3975137 do you feel like a puzzle you cant find your missing piece
3975138 write songs that carry the listener along regardless of their reservations indeed almost despite them
3975139 the perplexingly titled vicky cristina barcelona is woody allens best film in years talk about damning with faint praise like tax season and shitty weather allens lackadaisical late period movies arrive with glum regularity and a resigned sigh at this point its hard to even remember that faraway era of classics but the workaholic woodman is still grinding out a new flick every 10 months or so whether the scripts are ready or not these days when hes stuck hell just recycle stripmining crimes and misdemeanors for match point and then again for januarys cassandras dream so it comes as a surprise that vicky is such a pleasant little trifle sure its problematic and sloppy but graded on the steep curve one must apply to recent woody allen movies this probably his most agreeable effort since 1999s loopy la strada remake sweet and lowdown
3975140 whats most notable about the films use of blackface is how much softer it is compared with the rather more vulgar and far less loving exploitation of what you might call jewface
3975141 frank sinatra is the only artist to feature among the top 10 favourite songs of both us presidential candidates it has been revealed democrat barack obama included youd be so easy to love and john mccain ive got you under my skin in the lists compiled by us magazine blender abba are favoured by republican mr mccain with dancing queen at number one and take a chance on me at three obamas favourite song meanwhile is fugees 1996 hit ready or not the rest of obamas top five features older tracks with marvin gayes whats going on at number two and bruce springsteens im on fire at number three his top five is made up by gimme shelter by rolling stones and nina simones sinnerman
3975142 a woman who grew to be 7 feet 7 inches tall and was recognized as the worlds tallest female died early wednesday a friend said she was 53 sandy allen who used her height to inspire schoolchildren to accept those who are different died at a nursing home in her hometown of shelbyville ind family friend rita rose said the cause of death was not yet known allen had been hospitalized in recent months as she suffered from a recurring blood infection along with diabetes breathing troubles and kidney failure rose said

3975144 unfortunately lukes knee blew up afterwards was worse again this morning and the scan has then revealed the bad news
3975145 when youre young youre so hungry i think thats a big advantage
3975146 russians have done it won an olympic gold medal at my age and i figure man were just as tough as them if not tougher
3975147 u s coach kevin jackson said the olympics are a higher pedestal and americans tend to wrestle smarter and harder in them its a lot bigger to us than anything else
3975148 he works at a high pace that most people frankly dont understand
3975149 ive seen that kind of talent before but i havent seen the blend of the work ethic and talent
3975150 he made a decision either i can be like these guys or i can be somebody new a trendsetter i can blaze a new path whatever cheesy analogy you want to use
3975151 theres something there in that mentality that brings out the fight he didnt take the easy way out the road the woe is me mentality and that says a lot
3975152 i cant understand this whos discussing this youre discussing this
3975153 its absolutely the best british team thats ever left british shores
3975154 rebecca romero is i feel one of my strongest competitors
3975155 i have so much respect for her i realise that she is a second time olympian so she has experience from the games
3975156 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3975157 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3975158 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3975159 any civilised country would act same way i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
3975160 we do theology for you so you dont hurt yourself
3975161 no one really did anything wrong i just wish i could have gotten that pitch to vernon down a little more
3975162 i didnt throw enough strikes early but i started to relax about the fourth inning thats when i started making the pitches i wanted
3975163 you get a walk an aggravating bunt and then a double play grounder that takes a bad hop
3975164 kenny did very well tonight but weve been getting bad hops lately
3975165 he just has to work on getting first pitch strikes and getting ahead of hitters
3975166 i didnt want to go out there and see a bone sticking out of his leg
3975167 hell be reassessed in a couple days but if he cant pitch it will be a big loss for the team
3975168 i dont pay attention to been on waivers plenty of times
3975169 lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like
3975170 saakashvili said he is aware of problems with supplying the pilotless drones that his army ordered from israeli companies but not of the stopping of any other shipments of military aid
3975171 the pentagon is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia
3975172 according to staff officers accompanying colonel general anatoly nogovitsyn returning from the battlefront at least 7 foreign fighters identified as american and israel soldiers have been found among the rubble of the now freed but destroyed capital city of south ossetia tskhinvali
3975173 i am distressed that attorney general mukasey has been so quick to determine that no criminal offense has been committed
3975174 it is not enough for mr mukasey to assert that things are different under his watch the department of justice cannot reestablish its credibility so long as it persists in a strategy designed to avoid revealing all the facts that have so compromised the integrity of the department of justice and to prevent real accountability for misconduct by former doj officials
3975175 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
3975176 omg he is so hot when he points that gun 1 1
3975177 i will help keep confronting her on her childish narcissistic behavior until i get bored

3975181 there will be civilian flaggers on massachusetts roads this fall

3975183 some of americas strongest leaders on the economy and energy
3975184 if you do a good job it helps grow a national audience and whatever his weaknesses are patrick has always been given high marks for his speaking ability
3975185 thats going to go on until the entire cabinet and all administrators are named
3975186 they looked her over and im happy to say other than being distressed she was doing fine
3975187 the best thing to do if you have a cat and its not in a good situation is to bring it into an animal care and adoption center
3975188 that way the cat has a chance for a new home and will be treated humanely
3975189 so bene che il primo servizio che posso rendere alla chiesa e allumanit proprio quello della preghiera perch pregando pongo nelle mani del signore con fiducia il ministero che lui stesso mi ha affidato insieme alle sorti dellintera comunit ecclesiale e civile chi prega non perde mai la speranza anche quando venisse a trovarsi in situazioni difficili e persino umanamente disperate
3975190 since he was a tiny tot he always loved animals
3975191 his uncle ran the humane society in connecticut and visiting his uncle was like going to the zoo so his love of animals just grew from there
3975192 after a number of years working all over he got itchy and came home and said hes moving to las vegas to work for siegfried and roy
3975193 he put his portfolio together and gave it to their secretary they called him and he was in his glory he knew the animals by name and worked at mr roys ranch feeding the animals walking with them training them and he would transport the animals back and forth from mr roys ranch to the casino for the magic shows it took a strong guy to hold them back and thats what bryan was good for it was the job of his life
3975194 it was definitely wild but well take it giants pitcher barry zito was doing really well unfortunately for him at the end things went bad and we just kind of got in the way of some balls
3975195 ive never seen anything like it but ill take it
3975196 thats the sign of a good team taking advantage of your opportunities
3975197 then we cant hit two batters with the bases loaded
3975198 im most upset with the walk to loretta and hitting quintero
3975199 those were the difference makers its my job to come back and attack loretta you cant do anything about bloop hits and sacrifice flies its on me for walking loretta thats the difference maker
3975200 it is a trend that is not favorable to us
3975201 the possibility of a continued decline in sales tax revenue should serve as a reminder that while we want to get each district the best possible facility some extras might have to be scaled back
3975202 he got caught in a bad situation and somebody needs to run against him
3975203 with energy prices what they are now an engine the size thats in those trucks burns a gallon of fuel per hour of idling
3975204 we all end up paying for these things one way or another
3975205 we have been working closely with the u s epa to resolve this issue
3975206 as a leading waste and environmental services provider we understand the critical role we play in being good environmental stewards
3975207 exposure to fine particles really can be damaging to peoples health especially the elderly and people who suffer from asthma we want to make sure the pollution stops
3975208 creating unique and exclusive themed content is a key element of our strategy because the power of popular international brands and their ability to add substantial value to our game portfolio is clear
3975209 through the years whenever i would mix my records i would usually do a mix of specific songs without the lead guitar
3975210 playing to these naked tracks or creating loops of various sections to endlessly meander over is a phenomenal way to discover unique musical ideas from within yourself
3975211 when we are playing an instrument and our mind enters that exclusive elusive mental real estate of our own personal muse it can result in a form of musical meditation
3975212 this series of play along cds is designed to help create an atmosphere of focus so you can shred yourself into a personally induced inspirational nirvana
3975213 for the most part the tracks in this series are presented in their original form with the lead guitar removed
3975214 all 5 disks will be offered together in one package at various retail stores through vai
3975215 this piece of music is contributed to this project out of respect and love for the great city of minneapolis and with sympathy and support to the families who were affected by the august 1st 2007 bridge disaster we are perpetually rebuilding everything from our cities to our souls god bless
3975216 in the next ten years when advances in digital and online technology open up new avenues for contributions in the world china and hong kong will represent a very substantial percentage of the innovation that will take place
3975217 this is why were here in working closely with the best universities microsoft research asia brings together the very brightest people from across china and asia giving them the expertise ideas and resources only microsoft can offer so they can focus on the new generation of breakthroughs and discoveries
3975218 for a better future in asia microsoft research asia has worked closely with the top minds of academia to foster stronger knowledge based economies throughout the region
3975219 hand in hand with universities and institutions weve made significant strides in helping countries cultivate their next generations of business leaders innovators and entrepreneurs over the past 10 years we look forward to continuing that winning partnership in china
3975220 the lab has helped china embrace information technology through collaborative links and partnerships with academic institutions
3975221 and now after a decade of achievement and discovery together we are committed to china and its academic community more than ever not only in helping them adapt to the global trends of it and the digital age but to adopting it as their own
3975222 hong kong originally didnt really have much of an industry that handled computer science before so were very fortunate to have microsofts help especially with the joint labs
3975223 because of the joint labs hong kongs top schools are taking on the worlds most challenging research projects for a better tomorrow but more importantly these labs are bringing the best of minds together in an academic environment
3975224 since 1999 weve had 95 students from universities in hong kong who have had internships in our research group worldwide
3975225 in the us its a challenge to attract the smartest people to go to science instead they all want to go to wall street the world needs more scientists and researchers
3975226 microsoft research asia and chinese university of hong kong share a long history of collaboration innovation and unforgettable academic exchanges that have helped foster chinas brilliant minds of tomorrow
3975227 i hope we can continue working closely with microsoft in the next decade we look forward to this very valuable partnership not only for universities but for hong kong asia and the world as a whole
3975228 given that things have been fairly quiet on the monetary policy front its almost inevitable that the sharp decline in global oil prices has driven this fall in inflation expectations especially since petrol prices are most likely to keep falling
3975229 im hopeful theyll pay attention to the motion whether we have any outcomes from the motion is another matter
3975230 if we have no response from council within the four weeks well have to move ahead for a petition to the new south wales parliament
3975231 we would like the consensus of the community on some action points to take forward to resolve the dispute
3975232 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3975233 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3975234 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3975235 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3975237 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3975238 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3975239 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3975240 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3975241 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3975242 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3975243 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3975244 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3975245 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3975246 no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit

3975255 this is significant news for the publishing industry which continues to face challenges in selling print copies
3975256 it represents the first example of a major independent news website that is aggressively promoting print sales for all publishers and at the same time not cannibalizing the print product todays announcement also represents our commitment to continuing to build the coverawards brand among publishers advertisers and consumers
3975257 this agreement demonstrates universal news unique ability to increase the print sales and improve sell through for publishers in todays challenging newsstand environment
3975258 the direct links from coverawards to universalnewsondemand will help publishers reach existing newsstand buyers in a convenient fashion as well as new consumers that may not traditionally have access to their newsstand product
3975259 the city of san marcos is facing significant threats to life health and property due to a water main break
3975260 presently 25 percent of the city does not have water at this time including the central texas medical center hospital and nursing homes
3975261 this years survey reveals that too many mothers and fathers are problem parents who fail to take essential steps to prevent their kids from smoking drinking or using drugs by their actions and inactions by failing to become part of the solution these parents become part of the problem of teen alcohol and drug abuse
3975262 indeed these problem parents enable some even encourage their 12 to 17 year olds to use and abuse tobacco alcohol and illegal and prescription drugs
3975263 parents who are not aware of such conduct by their teens or are not candid about it are problem parents whose failure to monitor their childrens school night activities increases the risk of drug or alcohol use
3975264 by leaving abuseable and addictive medications like oxycontin and vicodin around the house thus making these drugs readily available to their children these problem parents become passive pushers
3975265 every mother and father should look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are doing the parenting essential to help their child negotiate the difficult teen years free of tobacco alcohol and drugs
3975266 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
3975267 it is inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of the reach of their children and tolerate drug infected schools the parents who smoke marijuana with children should be considered child abusers by identifying the characteristics of problem parents we seek to identify actions that parents can take and avoid in order to become part of the solution and raise healthy drug free children

3975301 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
3975302 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
3975303 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
3975304 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
3975305 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
3975306 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
3975307 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
3975308 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
3975309 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

3975398 ive been through both sides of the coin when youve won super bowls and when youve lost super bowls and sometimes its harder to put it behind you when youve won it
3975399 you think that you dont need to work anymore you think that youve got it all figured out but after an unsuccessful season the fire is burning even more
3975400 you look back on last year and we did a lot of great things that was a disappointing finish one way or the other it doesnt make any difference were into 2008 and our focus is on this year
3975401 well look back with mixed feelings on last year but it doesnt really matter
3975402 i was rooting for the patriots to win the super bowl
3975403 i wanted to be a witness to history with an undefeated team i was with them
3975404 even being a player you become a fan its very rare you see history made especially in this game
3975405 from a fan standpoint it was marvelous this is my 10th year in the league and i never thought anybody would go undefeated in the regular season then once they got to the playoffs there was just an anticipation of if they could do it
3975406 realistically i probably wouldnt have thought they would i thought they were probably a playoff team
3975407 you always have emotions when watching it because you remember the disappointment you felt after the game just like when you watch games you have won you remember the excitement you felt
3975408 it was one game last season that we all felt we could have played a little better you cant change what happened as hard as you want to you cant so what can you do you can move forward with the awareness that you can improve
3975409 you improve by winning it all which we didnt do last year
3975410 you improve by finishing what we started and you improve by continuing to build your team toward the future as well
3975411 theres a lot of things we can do better that we need to do better

3975413 our jobs are determined by alignments and it really doesnt matter who is out there in front of you you just have to get the job done
3975414 i think its disrespectful to the giants their defensive line their front seven and their coaching staff they did a tremendous job that day they really did
3975415 you try to retain your own players but you know the way things are in this league there are going to be changes
3975416 most of the offers were more than it was here but ive had my big contract
3975417 this is my 10th year in the league and it really wasnt about the money
3975418 i looked at all my options and this suited me best especially with the opportunities here

3975423 you lose it there were down days in the beginning but you put those behind you very quickly because what weve done a good job of around here is when weve won a lot of games is suppress success weve always looked on to whats next

3975436 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won

3975463 malaysiakini said it would reveal the identities of the commenters if it could however the cops raided and seized all their computers the only reason that may help in this case is to obtain correspondence between the commenter and rpk for example e mails as evidence for further investigation if not then the only thing rpk can give them is the internet protocol addresses and times which these addresses were logged onto his site the police can then cross reference this with the service provider for example tmnet to find out exactly which computer was logged on
3975464 this is akin to an invasion of privacy the complainant should point out specific comments for the court to decide if they are objectionable or would aid in an investigation

3975485 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3975486 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3975487 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3975488 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3975489 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation

3975492 in the event of a catastrophic cooling failure the processor will automatically shut down when the silicon temperature has exceeded the tcc activation temperature by approximately 20 to 25 c at this point the system bus signal thermtrip goes active and power must be removed from the processor

3975498 delay stepped down in june 2006 and five months later republicans lost the house this is not a coincidence in my opinion the conservative movement needs the wisdom of tom delay as we gear up for the 2008 presidential election
3975499 call tom delay the exterminator or the hammer if you wish
3975500 if tom delay were a democrat we would control the house
3975501 tom delay drove the conservative cause through congress and now hes driving the message that conservatives must unite to take our country back and rebuild the conservative movement
3975502 when tom delay speaks he doesnt just give his opinion he puts conservatives to work and its that kind of action we need building up to this election

3975508 deeper and better understanding of oregon politics than almost anyone
3975509 frankly the political conversation moves too fast these days for the print edition
3975510 now i can be part of that conversation in real time beyond that we have some marvelous strengths at the oregonian that we can bring to the political blogging business we come across way more information than we can get into print and listen closely here we dont have an axe to grind i intend to be the same honest broker of information ive always been except now i can let you in on a lot more of what ive learned
3975511 besides original reporting i look for lots of links to interesting stuff that i think the politically aware northwesterner ought to know about
3975512 after all these years in the business theres no editor telling me whats interesting or what isnt i just throw it out there and see what people think
3975513 i have nothing negative to say about blogs done by my newspaper competitors
3975514 i dont want to say i create a better product than those guys
3975515 focus on the blog in a way most other reporters cant
3975516 i realize im lucky in having the blog as my primary job while others still have to write for the paper as well
3975517 i have the luxury of being able to cover issues and people statewide and dont have to worry about writing for the paper
3975518 reporting a level of analysis and authority that readers notice and value at postman on politics
3975519 i dont do much of the small humorous sort of notebook items sometimes it is just a very short piece to break a little news other times it is an analysis of whats been in the news maybe something even in my own paper that i feel needs more context i also do a lot more original reporting now

3975523 we have lived past budget deadlines since 2003 and it was just in the last two years we were confronted with this
3975524 the governor has got a responsibility to maintain order and provide critical services
3975525 the conflict between that responsibility and the constitutional prohibition is not changed with the ruling
3975526 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3975527 one reason we decided to go into a place like sak n save is that looking at the market these days everyone is very busy so they want the convenience of one stop shopping
3975528 this sak n save has everything it has a bank it has a pharmacy it has a post office it also has 24 000 people walking through its doors in one week

3975581 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3975582 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort

3975584 youve got stephanie rice who has just come up and a star like katie hoff saying what happened
3975585 shes a stud she swam many many events and many unusual doubles
3975586 id be tired too if i had more events shes an awesome swimmer and a great representative of our womens team
3975587 i still get nervous but theres just more confidence there to back me up i cant control my competitors but if i have great swims then i should do pretty well
3975588 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3975589 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts

3975593 while faith and its effects can be found throughout pop culture rarely does a film address it so directly and in such an engaging way as in henry poole is here we believe that its treatment of faith will generate dialogue especially among the young adults that theology on tap touches through its many events
3975594 program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3975595 disclosure of this information will significantly compromise the charliecard and charlieticket systems
3975596 initial contact they said the fbi was investigating and that was not we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them and we got a little concerned about what was happening
3975597 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3975598 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3975599 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about us policy

3975603 i think its a great idea 2 id like to know where 2 will get me like how far it will take me but 2 sounds great its a lot cheaper than a taxi ride
3975604 ive been going downtown for years and its always a hassle for me to get a cab ride back so why not have a bus to bring us downtown greenville has it raleigh has it
3975605 i never thought in a long time that anything like this would happen but him being a loner and he was a weird person i mean when i say weird he just didnt want to associate with nobody or have anything with nobody you had to speak to him before he spoke to you
3975606 i tried to explain to them that i was a british journalist but they would not even let me take out my identification documents
3975607 the most pro lgbt proposed platform in democratic party history
3975608 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act

3975610 transfolks you and your issues are on the table but theres a limit were all quite comfortable including you in a hate crimes law after all thats easy to get done and it makes us look good thing is many of us are still not quite so sure we want to make the effort to actually fight for you and possibly expend valuable political capital on your behalf in order to protect you from discrimination in the workplace so were leaving ourselves a back door just in case we decide to chicken out again
3975611 the slogan of the olympic games is one world one dream
3975612 the dream is to see the children grow up in a peaceful environment and this is the dream of the children in cyprus
3975613 this is an ancient ship entrenched in history which was discovered near my home village thats why i feel like offering you a piece from my heart
3975614 my players have given their best at the court and played well at the first two sets but cuba is more experienced than us to handle the crucial points their powerful serves also caused great troubles to our reception
3975615 we had to play with extraordinary effort to reach the high level of china if we meet again in the future im still not sure who will win
3975616 we have improved our blocking defense and serving since the world grand prix final round and i dont know what else we can improve on
3975617 i just hope that we can keep playing like this
3975618 i am very happy for the victory we played better and better in the last two games
3975619 i am confident that we can make the quarterfinals and even go further
3975620 its going to be a very tough game china is the host and they play very well
3975621 though i do know well of the chinese team its the players to play the game not me we just get well prepared and try to play the best
3975622 our players have an average age of just over 18 in the next olympic games when the other teams have to change over their players we wont have to change our squad
3975623 at a large pharma company youre managing or directing things at such a high level you couldnt really see things at a level where youre exposed to the science anymore
3975624 i fell in love with the science they have here
3975625 its hard to build a company to make protein drugs if youre not in the bay area or here
3975626 if you havent made a vc a lot of money your ability to get funded for just an idea is laughable
3975627 on the power infrastructure side of things there were some lessons learned but unfortunately they havent been resolved yet
3975628 for example if youre in a wide scale power outage and you have your diesel generators that you bought five years ago after the last outage if power goes out to the entire city or county or wherever you are youre not going to be the only guy looking for diesel to fill those generators
3975629 for organizations who had been growing more reliant upon electronic information over the last six or seven years it became very apparent to many of these organizations that they did not have adequate disaster recovery plans in place
3975630 it also woke people up to the fact that widespread disasters can and do occur here in comfy cozy north america 50 million people were affected by that
3975631 a real stumbling block is getting cfo approval for disaster recovery and continuity expenditures
3975632 this is really an insurance policy that were talking about here and of course people begrudge spending money on insurance because they will probably never have to use it but if they do theyll be glad they had it
3975633 die konjunktur ist in den letzten wochen regelrecht eingebrochen und das weltweit so gibt es zum jetzigen zeitpunkt wenige berzeugende faktoren die eine weitere verschlechterung in den n chsten monaten aufhalten k nnen man sollte sich derzeit darauf einstellen dass es auch in europa zumindest in einigen staaten eine rezession geben k nnte die signale sprechen momentan eher daf r als dagegen

3975639 really its about pushing that information out to end users
3975640 bringing the end user into the whole problem of master data management
3975641 that strategy execution loop is of no value if you dont trust the data thats feeding you
3975642 do you have data integrity around that to be able to make business changes based on those risk thresholds that you set
3975643 so you dont have to do it over and over
3975644 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3975645 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3975646 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3975647 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3975648 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3975649 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3975650 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3975651 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3975652 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3975653 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3975654 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3975655 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3975656 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3975657 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3975658 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3975659 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3975660 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3975661 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3975662 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3975663 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3975664 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro

3975669 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3975670 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3975671 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3975672 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3975673 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3975674 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3975675 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3975676 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3975677 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3975683 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3975684 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3975685 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3975686 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3975687 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3975688 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3975689 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3975690 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3975691 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3975692 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3975693 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3975694 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3975695 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3975696 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3975697 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3975698 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3975699 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3975700 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3975701 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3975702 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3975703 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3975704 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3975705 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3975706 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3975707 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3975708 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3975709 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

3975711 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3975712 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3975713 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3975714 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3975715 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3975716 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3975717 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3975718 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3975719 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3975721 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3975722 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3975723 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3975724 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3975725 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3975726 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3975727 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3975728 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3975729 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3975730 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3975731 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3975732 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3975733 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3975734 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3975735 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3975736 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3975737 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3975738 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3975739 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3975740 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3975741 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3975742 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3975743 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3975744 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3975750 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3975751 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3975752 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3975758 el gobierno no deber a impulsar la liberalizaci n del consumo de drogas
3975759 ha trascendido en los medios que el gobierno nacional estudia un proyecto que pretende liberalizar el consumo y quitarle responsabilidades penales a los portadores de drogas ilegales para uso personal
3975760 e l consumo de drogas ilegales es una cuesti n que est vinculada directamente con la salud de los bonaerenses especialmente los m s j venes adolescentes y ni os
3975761 es de vital importancia que la c mara de diputados fije su posici n al respecto en defensa las familias bonaerenses
3975762 eliminar la responsabilidad por la tenencia de sustancias ilegales es liberalizar el consumo y pensar que no tendr consecuencias negativas sobre la salud la seguridad y la integridad de la gente es una ingenuidad muy peligrosa
3975763 liberar a los clientes de los narcos de su responsabilidad es darle una herramienta m s de marketing a quienes lucran con la vida y la muerte de los miles de j venes que caen en el flagelo de las drogas y de quienes sufren las consecuencias en
3975764 el gobierno no deber a impulsar la liberalizaci n del consumo de drogas
3975765 there were some nice voices in this group but you just arent what we are looking for
3975766 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3975767 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3975768 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3975769 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3975770 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3975775 i tried to relax and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others
3975776 the night before the race my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
3975777 this is the greatest day of my life a dream has come true
3975778 i may have lost the world record but i am an olympic champion and that lasts four years
3975779 i felt different after that if i didnt win that race i would have been anxious i was going to improve my time a bit more but i guess that to win this race is more important
3975780 i probably would have liked to have gone a bit faster than that
3975781 these technologies had the unfortunate characteristic of being best suited for production at or near the point of energy consumption

3975784 the scientists she does mention are mostly either well known cranks or are unqualified to comment on climate science
3975785 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
3975786 i know theres an interest in this and i know its a topical debate but you just honestly cant make judgments about this issue at this point in time we havent determined any projects
3975787 it may be that theyre transurban not affected that theres no claim at all it may be that there is but you cant make those judgments until later this year so im not prepared really to predict or make assessments its completely hypothetical
3975788 in terms of sleeping rough it probably tends to predominantly be aboriginal people but if we look at the housing situation overall were finding that people who are moving to alice springs for work they might be families they might be individuals cannot get into the private rental market
3975789 last year was the year of the widget but this year is the year of how do we monetize the widget
3975790 ok now what when does this start making money for us
3975791 it is so nice to come home to you ive missed you
3975792 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3975793 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3975794 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
3975795 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
3975796 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
3975797 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
3975798 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
3975799 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
3975800 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
3975801 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
3975802 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
3975803 all evidence that was collected back in 85 back in 94 and evidence that has been recently collected by way of interviews and everything else will be examined with every modern technology we have available to us
3975804 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done

3975813 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3975814 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
3975815 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3975816 we recognise the sovereignty and independence of georgia but territorial integrity its just another matter
3975817 south ossetia and abkhazia never were part of georgia as an independent country
3975818 that gives the russians undefined security rights in undefined territory in georgia thats an invitation to further problems
3975819 the russians have been in breach of international law there will be consequences of some sort
3975820 we dont have time now to get into long discussions on blame
3975821 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
3975822 weve got to invest in our infrastructure because it is aging
3975823 by borrowing through the mwra we are able to get much lower costs than we otherwise would be able to get ourselves
3975824 at some point we have to start looking out for the ratepayer
3975825 we run this is a self sustaining department and the costs have to be covered
3975826 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

3975830 if they think also that somehow its all going to work because theyre going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that would be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3975831 if they think that this is the way to go and we end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land and into unsustainable unmanageable and degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out and i think it will be an absolute disaster
3975832 nama yang diberikan oleh keluarga abu bakar adalah abdullah tetapi dia sering dipanggil dengan nama atiq
3975833 biasanya orang arab menyebut sesuatu yang sangat bagus dengan sebutan atiq
3975834 tidak ada seorang pun ayah dari kalangan muhajirin yang masuk islam selain abu bakar
3975835 abu bakar berkulit putih kekuning kuningan lembut berambut keriting pangkal pahanya ramping dan kain sarungnya tidak pernah naik di atas lututnya
3975836 tidak ada harta yang lebih bermanfaat bagiku daripada hartanya abu bakar
3975837 ketika abu bakar masuk islam dia mempunyai empat puluh ribu dinar
3975838 kedua orang ini adalah pemimpin penghuni surga dari dulu hingga yang terakhir kecuali para nabi dan rosul engkau jangan memberikan informasi ini kepada mereka wahai ali
3975839 tetapi dia adalah saudaraku dan sahabatku yang dilandaskan karena cinta kepada alloh tutuplah jendela masjid kecuali jendela abu bakar
3975840 abu bakar adalah pemimpin kami orang terbaik kami dan orang yang menjadikan kami cinta kepada rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam
3975841 aku pernah berkata kepada aisyah siapa sahabat nabi shollallohu alaihi wa sallam yang paling beliau cintai
3975842 sesungguhnya ada seorang hamba yang diizinkan oleh alloh untuk memilih antara kemegahan dunia dengan apa yang ada di sisi nya lalu dia memilih apa yang ada di sisi nya
3975843 lihatlah syaikh ini rosululloh mengabarkan tentang orang yang diberi pilihan oleh alloh tetapi dia berkata kami siap menjadi penebusmu
3975844 orang yang diberi pilihan itu adalah rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam sedangkan abu bakar adalah orang yang paling tahu tentang hal itu dari kami
3975845 rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tidak ada seorang pun yang meminta kepada kami kecuali kami akan memberinya selain abu bakar karena dia justru memiliki tangan yang dengannya alloh mencukupinya pada hari kiamat tidak ada harta yang memberiku manfaat sama sekali selain harta milik abu bakar seandainya aku boleh mengambil seorang kekasih tentu aku akan mengambil abu bakar sebagai kekasih ketahuilah sahabat kalian ini adalah kekasih alloh
3975846 ayahku menceritakan kepadaku bahwa seorang perempuan pernah menemui rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam lalu berkata tentang sesuatu kepada beliau dan beliau pun memerintahkan sesuatu kepadanya perempuan itu berkata bagaimana ya rosululloh jika aku tidak menemukanmu lagi karena engkau meninggal beliau menjawab jika kamu tidak menemuiku lagi maka temuilah abu bakar
3975847 rosululloh bersabda kepadaku ketika beliau sedang sakit panggillah ayah dan saudaramu supaya menuliskan suratku karena aku takut ada orang yang berangan angan dan ada orang yang berkata begini dan begitu lalu alloh dan orang orang beriman menolak kecuali abu bakar
3975848 ketika abu bakar dan umar sedang berdiskusi tiba tiba umar marah kepada abu bakar
3975849 umar kemudian menyesali perbuatannya maka ia lalu datang dan duduk di samping nabi shollallohu alaihi wa sallam lantas menceritakan masalah itu kepada nabi
3975850 demi alloh ya rosululloh aku benar benar telah berbuat zholim
3975851 apakah kalian meninggalkan sahabatku karenaku aku menyerukan kepada kalian wahai manusia sesungguhnya aku adalah utusan kepada kalian semua lalu kalian berkata kamu berdusta namun abu bakar berkatam engkau benar
3975852 ketika abu bakar menjadi khalifah pagi harinya dia memanggul barang dagangannya sendiri ketika dia bertemu dengan umar dan abu ubaidah mereka lalu melarangnya
3975853 abu bakar adalah sosok yang paling pandai menakwilkan mimpi dari kalangan umat ini setelah nabi shollallohu alaihi wa sallam
3975854 demi alloh abu bakar tidak pernah membaca syair baik pada masa jahiliyah maupun islam dia dan utsman telah meninggalkan minum khomer sejak masa jahiliyah
3975855 ketahuilah orang yang paling mulia dari umat ini setelah nabinya adalah abu bakar siapa pun yang mengatakan hal yang bertentangan dengan ini setelah aku berdiri di sini berarti dia telah mereka reka kebohongan sehingga dia berhak mendapatkan hukuman
3975856 pada masa rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam kami pernah berkata jika abu bakar umar dan utsman meninggal dunia maka manusia sama ketika perkataan tersebut sampai kepada rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam beliau tidak mengingkarinya
3975857 sebaik baik orang dari kalangan umat ini setelah nabinya adalah abu bakar dan umar
3975858 orang yang paling besar pahalanya dalam masalah mushaf adalah abu bakar dialah orang yang mengumpulkan al quran dari lembaran lembaran pelepah kurma
3975859 hari pertama abu bakar sakit beliau mandi pada saat cuaca sangat dingin sehingga beliau menderita flu dan panas dingin sehingga selama lima belas hari tidak dapat sholat berjamaah dia kemudian menyuruh umar untuk memimpin sholat jamaah dan mereka menjenguknya utsman lalu mewajibkan mereka untuk menjenguknya abu bakar wafat pada malam selasa 22 jumadil akhir ketika itu beliau telah menjabat sebagai khalifah selama dua tahun seratus hari
3975860 ketika abu bakar sudah merasa berat dia memanggil abdurrahman bin auf seraya berkatam ceritakan kepadaku tentang umar abdurrahman menjawab jangan bertanya kepadaku tentang sesuatu yang engkau lebih tahu dariku abu bakar berkata tidak apa apa abdurrahman berkata demi alloh pendapatnya lebih baik darimu di dalamnya abu bakar kemudian memanggil utsman dan bertanya kepadanya tentang umar utsman lalu menjawab menurutku jiwanya lebih baik daripada lahirnya dan di antara kita tidak ada orang yang sebanding dengannya abu bakar berkata semoga alloh merahmatimu demi alloh seandainya kamu meninggalkannya maka aku akan memusuhimu oleh karena itu said bina az zubair asyad bin hudhair dan yang lain selalu mengajak mereka berdua bermusyawarah seorang pria kemudian berkata apa yang kamu katakan kepada robb mu jika dia bertanya tentang penggantimu umar padahal kamu telah mengetahui kesalahannya abu bakar berkata dudukkanlah aku apakah engkau ingin menakut nakuti diriku dengan alloh aku ingin menegaskan bahwa aku telah memilih seorang khalifah terbaik di antara umat nya
3975861 tulislah bismillahirrahmanirrahim inilah janji abu bakar bin abu quhafah pada akhir masanya di dunia menjelang ajalnya tiba dan awal masanya memasuki akhirat kendati orang kafir menjadi beriman orang jahat menjadi baik dan pendusta menjadi jujur bahwa aku memilih umar bin khaththab sebagai penggantiku dengarlah dan taatilah dia sesungguhnya aku tidak pernah mengurangi kebaikan alloh rosul nya agamanya diriku dan diri kalian jika benar maka itulah prasangkaku dan pengetahuanku di dalamnya jika ternyata meleset maka setiap orang bertanggung jawab terhadap apa yang dilakukannya aku hanya menginginkan kebaikan dan aku tidak mengetahui alam ghaib dan orang orang yang zholim itu kelak akan mengetahui ke tempat mana mereka akan kembali
3975862 sumpah kekayaan tidak bermanfaat bagi seseorang jika ajal telah menjemput dan dada menyempit
3975863 sesungguhnya kami sejak menjabat sebagai amirul mukminin tidak pernah makan uang dinar dan dirham mereka tetapi memasukkan makanan yang paling jelek ke dalam perut kami dan memakai pakaian yang paling rendah kualitasnya ke badan kami kami juga tidak pernah mengambil sesuatu dari pajak kaum muslimin kecuali seorang budak habsyi ini unta tua ini dan unta hamil ini jika aku meninggal dunia maka kembalikan semuanya kepada umar
3975864 ketika abu bakar menjelang wafat ia sempat berkata yang aku tahu bahwa keluarga abu bakar hanya memiliki unta ini dan budak ini dia bekerja sebagai pedangnya kaum muslimin dan mengabdi kepada kami jika aku meninggal dunia maka kembalikan dia kepada umar ketika aisyah mengembalikannya kepada umar umar berkata semoga alloh merahmati abu bakar dia telah memberatkan orang orang sesudahnya
3975865 abu bakar pernah berwasiat agar dia dimandikan oleh istrinya asma binti umais dan jika tidak bisa maka mintalah bantuan kepada anaknya abdurrahman
3975866 ali pernah datang menengok abu bakar ketika ia dibungkus kain kafan ia berkata tidak ada orang yang bertemu alloh dengan shahifahnya lebih aku cintai daripada orang yang terbungkus dengan kafan ini
3975867 abu bakar pernah berwasiat agar dikuburkan di samping rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam maka ketika kuburan telah digali kepalanya pun diletakkan di sisi kedua pundak rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam

3976016 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

3976021 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3976022 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3976023 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3976024 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3976025 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3976026 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3976030 this will take a long time but is more useful
3976031 the government isnt stupid but many of their actions come from fear that giving people rights will undermine its rule
3976032 the world is big and there are various birds in the forest
3976033 this fix will stop the flood this time we mean it
3976034 does edwards suck yes but it is just one more reason to not vote for mccain
3976035 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3976036 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters

3976057 what disappointed me most of all in osaka was that if blonska had been given the kind of ban she should have been then wed have had two brits on the podium
3976058 it was my first year at the trials and i got some great experience i think ill be more prepared next time and hopefully i can run my own race and not get distracted by some of the other stuff i think its given me more focus and they say that female athletes peak in their late 20s so hopefully ill be peaking by then
3976059 thbt civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice
3976060 my opponent says he is against civil disobedience because he believes in gandhi
3976061 but ladies and gentlemen does he even know what gandhis concepts are does he know what satya graha really means because if he does he would be debating with me tonight mr o malley do you have any idea what happened in amritsar in 1919

3976063 my opponent says he believes in gandhi so i decided to play along with it but then he changed his concept into democracy that nothing erodes the rule of law but i tell you what ladies and gentlemen that whatever concept he is using i will play along with him
3976064 st augustine said an unjust law is no law at all which means i have a right even a duty to resist with violence or civil disobedience you should pray i choose the latter

3976066 my god this is unbelievable she used her opponents argument
3976067 you know this morning in the bedroom she told me she didnt prepare for anything how is that possible
3976068 thbt civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice
3976069 its a question that bothers me we have oxford cambridge and we have newcastle debate institution but we never won a single elsa award at this point in time it is that people starts questioning with of course doubt of our academic intelligence

3976116 you can write it down write down what foot it was more just convincing the coaches not to worry about anything they probably limited me on some stuff and that was up to them but im good to go
3976117 im getting back into my groove and theyve seen the things theyve expected to see when i first got here the confidence level has always been high but its just moreso just trying to put everything behind me and trying to get back to what im supposed to be
3976118 i think matts definitely closing the gap theres no doubt about it
3976119 i think hes really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days i think matt is getting more comfortable
3976120 they did not have winning performances is the way we look at it and its just a number of things we need to clean up
3976121 ive said it time and time again those guys need to play we knew this was going to take probably the full preseason to get those two guys ready and we feel like were on course to get that done

3976146 you matter to me so im going to risk looking like a goofball and make the effort
3976147 simply put weve gone from eating just to fill our stomachs to the stage where we are open to the complete pleasures of the dining experience
3976148 peoples eyes are opening up and they are becoming more international they are ready to accept and taste food from other parts of the world
3976149 now we can eat whatever we like without seasonal and geographical limitations
3976150 although food prices keep going up peoples love for tasty food hasnt changed
3976151 not pass our quality inspection and we do not have a replacement available in stock in the size and color you requested
3976152 a woman in her lifetime will spend far more hours hugging a handbag than a man
3976153 tiny personal museums with power to bring back a specific person event or time
3976154 of the parents who did get angry more than a third vented it
3976155 the real ugly part was that more than a quarter of the parents reported it had to do with their own child or their own childs performance
3976156 those parents that saw their children and their childrens performance as direct extensions of their own egos were the ones most susceptible to going down the path
3976157 these people feel they need to keep up with the joneses if my neighbors child is playing for the team my child needs to play for that team too they fear they are going to be left behind
3976158 from that day on i sit up by my car and read the paper and glance up every now and then and watch the game
3976159 i am there for my child nothing more nothing less
3976160 overall lower extremity mobility given the different movement planes forward back sideways and rotational
3976161 it works the quads hamstrings and calves for pushing off hamstring and calf eccentrically when landing and the up and down motion is good stimulus for the vestibular system which helps with balance
3976162 i think it started when i was in elementary school and i got picked on because of a space between my teeth
3976163 ive started to notice a difference ive started smiling more
3976164 probably the ideal candidate would be someone who had braces as a teenager
3976165 to me its just a much easier transition and it might be because of age
3976166 its similar but the results arent going to be exactly the same in every case i just think it depends on what our goals are if your primary objective is to have as straight as teeth as possible then invisalign might not be the best choice
3976167 so there are a lot of jobs where theyre not an option they dont do a great job of moving some teeth up and down and rotating but do a nice job of pushing teeth back or moving forward
3976168 we feel thats it probably due to individuals keeping their teeth longer
3976169 people are living longer and their teeth are in their mouth longer and they want to look good
3976170 its not a static environment its a very dynamic environment
3976171 now they have a job now they have good dental insurance and they think its time to do it im going to have these fixed
3976172 faith hope and love and the greatest of these is love

3976176 unfortunate that someone mrs dixon who works in human resources for the university of toledo would publicly express beliefs more appropriate for her place of worship
3976177 christians shouldnt flaunt their lifestyle they should just keep inside the closet
3976178 mrs dixon cannot effectively perform her job duties at the university now that she has publicly expressed discriminatory opinions
3976179 dixon has a right to her religious views and she has a right to freedom of speech but the university has a right to have someone in that position that is going to comply with the universitys diversity policy
3976180 your car accident your train wreck of a life effects other people
3976181 hey shes got no distractions lets all talk at the same time about absolutely everything and drive her crazy
3976182 howd we all get here oh yeah we know that crazy terri chic
3976183 shes just acting odd just dont worry about it okay
3976184 i didnt say that its just talk okay just relax
3976185 look im gonna tell you something you should never tell your best friend
3976186 shes wasnt ready to jump in thats not who she is shes never gonna jump in when you need her man
3976187 they who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
3976188 i remember the family 2 house up the street where the husband used to beat his wife pretty regularly and we could hear it going on as we treid to sleep the family next door would leave thier porch door open for her to crawl into and sleep on cold nights every now and then when it got really bad my father would put his uniform on my grandfather was a boston police officer for most of his adult life and go talk to the guy but it never did any good she would always wind up sleeping on the neighbors porch
3976189 buzzy street boston nothing mom you know i think i saw on the sign as we passed that it was spelled a little different
3976190 we have that book here somewhere from the house with some of the story let me find that
3976191 the train cars were made of freakin wood can you imagine
3976192 like those old trolley cars they had when i was growing up the ones that looked like twinkies and you could open the windows on they phased those out when the new japanese ones came in
3976193 so basicly the front end of the bridge held the back end up
3976194 not only was the bridge a bad idea in design but it actually the laws of physics
3976195 one minute hes casey jones without a care in the world and the next hes slowing down cautiously hmm
3976196 cows raised a hoof in greeting as the train rolled by
3976197 the accident happened in 1887 and linnea is your age so when she was a kid this thing was already more than 50 years old how did her father know about it
3976198 wow 23 out of 200 thats pretty amazing i would ahve thought that there would have been no survivors in the cars that fell
3976199 so one guy got paid like he was a company kinda sounds like the big dig
3976200 it had been his intention to form a company but he nevert got around to it
3976201 we should ride that train some time and find that bridge
3976202 love not what you are but what you may become

3976206 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3976207 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3976208 u n mediators cant even protect the dissident monks of burma or the opposition in zimbabwe let alone a small country trying to fight off single handed an invasion by the russian army
3976209 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3976210 us should immediately work with the e u and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
3976211 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3976212 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3976213 t he american armed and trained georgian army swarmed into south ossetia last thursday killing an estimated 2 000 civilians sending 40 000 south ossetians fleeing over the russian border and destroying much of the capital tskhinvali
3976214 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
3976215 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
3976216 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
3976217 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
3976218 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
3976219 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
3976220 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
3976221 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
3976222 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
3976223 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
3976224 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
3976225 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies
3976226 you are allowed to practice medicine if you provide such services for free
3976227 i appreciate all you guys taking the time to be here

3976230 this album is based on the musical roots of my family
3976231 i like to think of it as a remembrance and tribute to the memory of that amazing time in my life i have dedicated this album to the memory of my maternal grandma reva vickery she was right there all along playing a big part in the making of those memories in the late 90s she was struck with the horrible disease alzheimers it shook our family to the core that jovial rolly polly woman who reminded me of lou costello disappeared behind her large glasses alzheimers renders your mind blank as years of your personal history disappear it causes you to behave unlike the person you were all your life even forget the name of the man you have been married to for over 50 years or the fact that you were married to him at all
3976232 this music is for her for the last several years of her life due to her alzheimers she couldnt remember many things about her life or her family but she always enjoyed the music
3976233 im glad they are there and hope you will join me in helping them help others in finding a cure for this disease

3976240 thats my dad joyce who used to be a man but changed into a woman
3976241 dad went away and joyce came to live with us
3976242 dont you think that thats a pretty typical attitude among your friends and maybe they wont know or care about me

3976245 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day

3976249 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
3976250 this is about hundreds of thousand of individuals whose lives are being taken maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about whose comments and statements but now lets devote all our efforts to resolving a situation that is fraught with tragedy
3976251 an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media
3976252 this is a tale of us expansion not russian aggression
3976253 there are two races of beings the masses teeming and happy common clay if you like eating breeding working counting their pennies people who just live ordinary people xxx and then there are the others the noble ones the heroes the ones you can quite well imagine lying shot pale and tragic one minute triumphant with a guard of honor and the next being marched away between two gendarmes
3976254 we in the pse welcome the secs decision to set a higher standard requirement for the competent person of mining companies this way we can assure our investing public that we are providing them not only with material information but also quality and credible reports on mining and minerals which will guide them in making investment decisions
3976255 this is a positive development for our stock market because the pmrc minimizes the risks our investors are exposed to through proper disclosure by way of implementing the pmrc it makes our disclosure reporting compatible with major global mineral reporting standards and elevates the language we use with that of the international codes of south africa canada australia and european union which is a better way to attract more foreign investors to penetrate our local stock market
3976256 we believe that it will not only curb speculative trading in our listed mining companies but will also help soften market volatility

3976262 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
3976263 will really open all other amendments that may be considered
3976264 it becomes a plenary group tuloy tuloy na yan you cant say lets just change this
3976265 the implication of some statements of administration people is that you need to shift to federalism in order to give effect to the peace agreement there is no such thing because the adoption of a federal system for the entire government is not necessary
3976266 you just change those provisions and give more power to the autonomous region and call it bangsamoro homeland provision without touching other provisions of the constitution
3976267 because the section on autonomous regions already constitutes some exceptions thats why the constitutional commission enacted that provision on autonomous regions
3976268 why is it that some people are saying that ou cannot possibly implement the moa memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain with the moro islamic liberation front without changing the entire system to a federal government that is misleading
3976269 you can have a federal government that is presidential its not necessary that federal is always tied with parliamentary so you can still have limitations on the term of the president
3976270 like in the us the federal system there has a two term limit of the president
3976271 where did they get that authority to negotiate beyond the four corners of the constitution
3976272 doing a very poor job of rationalizing charter change and thats why there is a lot of mistrust
3976273 because the way they explain things is very misleading it makes people say baka yan term extension ang original motive
3976274 there is no connection between federalism and a peace agreement

3976285 i was going to get what i wanted practice this afternoon but somebody bumped it back in
3976286 the magic of matt stover i guess hes proven over a long period of time that hes one of the premier kickers in the history of the game
3976287 youve got to be able to put yourself in those situations as a kicker
3976288 theres nothing that can replicate that other than a game and thats as close as you can get in fact i think that was worse than kicking a game winner because you dont want to let your guys down
3976289 stover is the man but if he had missed it he would have been the most vilified guy on the team
3976290 he would make it really impossible for me to make did you see the defense they werent rushing very hard were they i knew i had all kinds of time
3976291 it was less than what we thought it was and its getting healthy
3976292 i just want to make sure i get it right before i get back into action
3976293 i ran into ray lewis and hes made of steel
3976294 it is not like a primary where there would be a big fight

3976306 children should wear shoes theyre foolproof protection against hot surfaces
3976307 i think they just wear them down and people give up
3976308 once wakely and associates make an agreement theyre there to chisel you down just as low as they can
3976309 you need to consider long term care as part of your financial plan
3976310 youre never too young to buy a long term care policy
3976311 you dont know how much the premiums are going to go up
3976312 you dont know when you get there and you need it if its going to be enough coverage for you
3976313 there are just so many variables for the whole thing
3976314 blood doping reduces fatigue by increasing the supply of oxygen to the exercising muscles
3976315 this will not increase the maximum force the muscle can generate but will permit the muscle to do more work for longer
3976316 people most interested in blood doping would be distance runners from probably 800 meters and up swimmers in the long races cyclists for sure perhaps people in rowing or in the triathlon so those would be the sports that just kind of pop right out
3976317 the amount of improvement would be clearly enough to give you a substantial edge in international competitions if you were an elite athlete
3976318 the difference between endogenous epo and recombinant human epo is not very big
3976319 what carsten has confirmed what people sort of thought was going on is that it would be possible for most people to use low doses of the stuff epo enough to get an edge
3976320 so somebody could cheat on monday and if the drug testers came on wednesday 48 hours might be enough for the stuff to be gone
3976321 some of these compounds have short acting periods of time in the body but the biological effects the positive effects on performance can be weeks or months
3976322 the cheaters are in a constant cat and mouse game with the authorities
3976323 theyre always changing their strategies in an effort to beat the tests
3976324 the fear with blood doping or epo use is that the blood count gets too high the blood gets too thick and it becomes hard for the heart to push the blood around the body or that somehow this high blood count contributes to somebody having or a blood clot
3976325 if somebody has an exceptional performance they must be cheating because there have been examples of exceptional performances when people were cheating
3976326 so every unusual performance every breakthrough performance every record somehow the question becomes is it real or to what extent did doping contribute to this and you just dont know
3976327 i told him that i was committed to his campaign
3976328 and i am im going to work as hard as i can
3976329 we knew we were going to be together so its no big deal and ive never not supported the democratic nominee since ive been an adult it was a seamless transition from clinton to barack
3976330 frankly senator clinton told me this is what she wanted me to do
3976331 she will not allow people to say anything negative about obama around her
3976332 she would not let anybody say anything negative about obama at her house
3976333 i told her i want her to be the number one member of the u s senate
3976334 i told her i want her to get our legislation from the house through the senate she started laughing because the senate is where all legislation goes to die
3976335 i told her that i didnt think that title fit her

3976369 i want them to step up with donations and help me find homes for the rest of the animals they said needed homes

3976372 we do see a lot of violations that occur repeatedly

3976527 die konjunktur ist in den letzten wochen regelrecht eingebrochen und das weltweit so gibt es zum jetzigen zeitpunkt wenige berzeugende faktoren die eine weitere verschlechterung in den n chsten monaten aufhalten k nnen man sollte sich derzeit darauf einstellen dass es auch in europa zumindest in einigen staaten eine rezession geben k nnte die signale sprechen momentan eher daf r als dagegen
3976528 wegen des schlechten konjunktursausblicks wird sich das wachstum im dritten und vierten quartal aller voraussicht nach jedoch nicht fortsetzen

3976534 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3976535 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage

3976544 if someone tells about kiln dryed cedar run that stuff is junk
3976545 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3976546 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3976547 an appearance of a conflict does exist in this matter
3976548 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3976549 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3976550 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him as many as seven times
3976551 i do not say to you seven times but seventy times seven
3976552 therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants 24 when he began the reckoning one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents 25 and as he could not pay his lord ordered him to be sold with his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made 26 so the servant fell on his knees imploring him lord have patience with me and i will pay you everything 27 and out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt 28 but that same servant as he went out came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii and seizing him by the throat he said pay what you owe 29 so his fellow servant fell down and besought him have patience with me and i will pay you 30 he refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay his debt 31 when his fellow servants saw what had taken place they were greatly distressed and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place 32 then his lord summoned him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you all that debt because you besought me 33 and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant as i had mercy on you 34 and in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers till he should pay all his debt 35 so also my heavenly father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart
3976553 therefore our lord did not limit forgiveness to a fixed number but declared that it must be continuous and forever
3976554 force yourself if necessary always to forgive those who offend you from the very first moment for the greatest injury or offense that you can suffer from them is nothing compared to what god has pardoned you

3976558 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3976559 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
3976560 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
3976561 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion

3976569 i can remember both mr rea and chet spending countless days in service to the oscpa along with others they helped form the reputable and service oriented oscpa which is one of the best and most active cpa societies
3976570 you can see homeless people in the area churches give food to them but youve got to do whatever you can to make the world better
3976571 i was thinking about that and i figured why not just do that instead of getting presents i usually dont even get to play with all of them and then you get more at christmas
3976572 we had 70 cans almost a full christmas tree box i think we did pretty good
3976573 i think its phenomenal hes a special person who puts other people first to have a 10 or 11 year old boy do that without someone asking him to is a real good show of character
3976574 i asked him are you sure and he was really set on it
3976575 it was pretty surprising we still got him gifts on our own i think its catching on hes inspired a lot of people to look out for those who are less fortunate
3976576 weve always tried to teach blake how to be charitable even at our church church of god at barrs mills he donates some of his allowance to the mission field through sunday school
3976577 it wouldnt be possible for him to do this if it wasnt for them
3976578 their families have been pretty generous he asked for one can and some of them brought 10 theyre lugging in these big bags of food i thought that was really cool to see these little guys doing that
3976579 its a great thing that hes chosen to do its a great group of friends hes lucky enough to be surrounded by
3976580 williams notes that if physical size is such an important consideration the current vice president shouldnt have been selected it should be pointed out that cheneys political career began in wyoming the least populous state in the nation with fewer than 525 000 residents its less than half the size of the richmond metro area
3976581 lets tear up all these roads and repave them to justify our budget for next year
3976582 2003 is considered the 21st century quick history lesson thats when we invaded iraq just clarifying because you just looked really dumb
3976583 in the 21st century one nation does not invade another nation with the intent of overthrowing the ruling government
3976584 look what he did he smeared all over the place
3976585 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3976586 to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
3976587 now lets go and kick the out of those iranians
3976588 in the 21st century nations dont invade other countries in europe
3976589 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year

3976602 well one kitten is that you are most certainly dead and two we popped your soul out before the death happens
3976603 remember that lady that was talking to you before she was your reaper and she popped your soul out before the brutal impact of your horrible death consider it as a courtesy before you die

3976612 hey how come people can see you and not me
3976613 oh please theres this little difference between you and me you are dead but me kitten ill have you know that i am

3976617 listen kitten you know that nice lady that popped out your soul you were the last soul she was suppose to reap you filled her quota my dear thus she gets a promotion in this gig and you are the newbie to take her place
3976618 well all reapers have a certain quota to fill we dont know how many we need to reap but when we get that last soul we know we get to be promoted to where no idea but we also need a replacement to take care of our duties and that last soul we reaped gets to be the lucky soul to become a reaper

3976626 there is absolutely no way that i am trying to or will be involved in any process to cover anything up
3976627 i want to make sure that everything that happens is revealed in an objective way and that recommendations that come from this inquiry by nopsa are acted upon
3976628 i also give another commitment if it is deemed necessary at the end of this process that there be a broader inquiry even a royal commission then we will have one
3976629 but first of all lets allow this inquiry to take its course its obviously producing some interesting information about the nature of the inspection regime and the issues that flow from that
3976630 i cant stop them from doing that but i think the general public can see pretty much what the objective is
3976631 in the industries mining and construction that are going gangbusters employers are prepared to pay top dollar for the sought after staff
3976632 but for businesses dependent on consumer spending it is an entirely different situation consumers are keeping a tighter hold on their wallets causing businesses in the hospitality sector to cut wages in order to control costs
3976633 although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term
3976634 the performance of asx during the difficult market conditions of fiscal 2008 underlines the resilience and diversity of the groups business model

3976638 if were talking about the enterprise and particularly if were talking large enterprise paid support is absolutely positively critical to use of linux in addition we believe it is actually commercial support or paid support not for rhel or suse but for centos debian or ubuntu that is helping to drive community linux in the enterprise

3976657 there are two americas in terms of our education system and that cant continue
3976658 elevating public funding of education is our biggest problem and most important priority we must be able to attract more talented people to education
3976659 u s student achievement is lagging compared to other countries especially in the sciences and math
3976660 the problem is acute in the inner cities we cant continue to do what were doing there are two americas in terms of our education system and that cant continue
3976661 if i can help elevate teaching in importance if i can draw attention to the matter of public education maybe i can direct conversation as it is we spend a lot of money in this country on things that arent important we need to do better
3976662 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3976663 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day

3976670 many experts have indicated that the demand will outstrip the supply of nurses
3976671 its not only a national problem but a local issue that demands community based interventions and innovative solutions
3976672 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this

3976687 de vraag groeit voortdurend en daarom zijn we op zoek naar nieuwe oppassers als we die niet snel vinden zullen we in de drukke winterperiode heel wat mensen niet kunnen helpen
3976688 wie voor 12u een aanvraag indient heeft normaal de dag nadien een oppas een doktersattest is altijd vereist
3976689 ook ouders of grootouders met ervaring of mensen met een pedagogische opleiding komen in aanmerking wie niet over een gepast diploma beschikt krijgt eerst een opleiding
3976690 het gaat echt om volwaardige contracten we bieden volledige kilometervergoeding gratis omniumverzekering en werkkledij
3976691 het is een trend dat mensen almaar vroeger boeken dit jaar is het extra interessant om er op tijd bij te zijn want winterreizen zijn 5 tot 10 duurder geworden wie nu boekt geniet een korting tot 10 zodat de prijsstijging gecompenseerd wordt vooral voor gezinnen met kinderen is dat meegenomen
3976692 er zijn verschillende graden van bewaking dat kan gaan van geregelde politiepatrouilles langs de woning van de betrokkene tot close protection waarbij de geviseerde persoon dag en nacht wordt bewaakt zelfs familieleden worden dan in bepaalde gevallen begeleid wanneer ze de woning verlaten
3976693 je moet die zaken ernstig nemen maar niet in paniek slaan en er best zoveel mogelijk over zwijgen
3976694 intussen zijn er 140 338 goedgekeurd een aantal dossiers zijn nog in beraad omdat we wachten op bijkomende info van het ministerie van financi n
3976695 het is de bedoeling om alles wat je nodig hebt in het onderwijs betaalbaar te maken daarom zijn de studietoelagen aangepast krijgen leerlingen gratis alle schoolgerief dat nodig is voor de eindtermen en is er een maximumfactuur voor schooluitstappen ingevoerd
3976696 nieuw is ook dat ouders voortaan hun studiebeurs met een gezinsdossier mogen aanvragen vroeger moesten ze voor elk kind apart een dossier indienen nu is n dossier voldoende dat vereenvoudigt de administratie
3976697 maar toch lieten ouders nog voor bijna 10 miljoen aan studietoelagen ongebruikt zowat 11 procent van het budget voor studiebeurzen het geld gaat wel niet verloren maar wordt in de pot van volgend jaar gestoken
3976698 ze zochten twee jonge kindjes in de leeftijdsklasse van mijn eigen zoon en dochter

3976700 ze zijn spontaner ik heb ze 10 minuutjes voor de achtergrond gezet in mijn eigen studio thuis titus met een voetbal ginger met haar fietshelm en fiets voor een campagne van een politieke partij zou ik nooit mijn eigen zoon en dochter laten poseren maar verkeersveiligheid is een belangrijk thema dat draagt een positieve boodschap uit ze rijden zelf nog niet met de fiets naar school de school ligt vrij ver en ginger kan pas zonder zijwieltjes fietsen maar gewoon op straat als voetganger kan er ook vanalles gebeuren

3976709 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3976710 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3976711 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3976712 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3976724 i mean they made it seem like any coloradan could go and now you have to work for your ticket
3976725 my experience matches what you are hearing from other sources because of my work schedule and other activities going on i did not sign up for the all star tickets but i was called by the campaign and told that i had to volunteer this week in order to get tickets at all i finally agreed to one three hour shift but it left a bad impression for this lifelong democrat i hope someone in the campaign understands that they are turning off volunteers with their aggressive and disorganized approach
3976726 there is no way i can volunteer between now and friday if that is the timeframe
3976727 the problem got worse today when i got three phone calls from three different people at the obama campaign office asking me to bring food for the staff i had signed up to donate snacks but i didnt realize i was supposed to feed the whole staff just thought youd want to know that the problem goes way beyond just the confusion about the tickets i have no idea how obama can win colorado when the campaign office is such a disaster
3976728 contrary to their previous reports european election observers said voting fraud took place during georgias recent election that returned president saakashvili to power opposition groups plan to continue protests the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce which sent election observers to georgia initially said the jan 5 presidential vote met international standards but problems with the election continue to surface

3976746 the conversion of hindus to islam happened over a period of time especially in the medieval period the people who embraced islam were not happy with hinduism which has a rigid system
3976747 this system made many people try to escape from it when opportunity arose across the country people from untouchable and other castes which faced discriminations became muslims in fact islam came as a big relief for them
3976748 about 98 per cent christians in andhra pradesh are from sc origin
3976749 the same backwardness is continuing till date that is why majority of muslims are poor

3976770 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd in june 2007 ranked the u s 15th among its 30 member nations in broadband adoption per capita although theres some debate over whether those numbers tell the whole story u s lawmakers and many tech groups have raised concerns about those rankings saying the u s is losing out on many economic benefits of broadband the itif report compared the u s broadband environment to eight other countries most with higher speeds and lower prices in several cases the countries launched extensive broadband programs in the last decade with government working closely with broadband providers to expand coverage and roll out next generation broadband the results in japan the average download speed is 63 6m bps bits per second and the lowest advertised price is 0 13 per megabit according to the report sweden a largely rural country has average download speeds of 16 8m bps and the lowest price is 0 35 per megabit in the u s the average download speed based on actual broadband services used is 4 9m bps the report says the lowest advertised price is 2 83 per megabit
3976771 two democrats in the u s house of representatives have introduced a bill that would subject broadband providers to antitrust violations if they block or slow internet traffic representative john conyers a michigan democrat and chairman of the house judiciary committee has sponsored the internet freedom and nondiscrimination act along with representative zoe lofgren a democrat from the silicon valley area of california the legislation requires internet service providers to interconnect with the facilities of other network providers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis it also requires them to operate their networks in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner so that all content applications and services are treated the same and have an equal opportunity to reach consumers any isps that do not follow these net neutrality rules would be subject to antitrust enforcement
3976772 specifically these impediments are lengthy queues to enter into telstras exchange buildings and service disruptions when migrating from the line sharing service to the unbundled local loop service
3976773 overall sales growth of 4 7 percent masked retail sales growth of 6 percent because wholesale fell 5 percent due to the rollout of competitor ull based networks
3976774 telstra will need every penny of revenue growth to hit their profitability target for 2010
3976775 the old cdma mobile network has already gone and we should see further big operating cost savings in 2009 as old it systems are decommissioned
3976776 this is especially the case because there is a question mark over continued revenue growth in a tough macroeconomic environment the biggest challenge is yet to come

3976778 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3976779 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3976780 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3976781 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3976782 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3976783 det r s kert f r mig att st upp f r mina behov och k nslor
3976784 its what i call real representation which is just being available for communication with residents and promoting their partnering with that representation
3976785 id do it simply by being available via phone internet being at neighborhood meetings being in the neighborhoods id hold regular meetings have newsletters a web site just to be a vigorous representative for the needs and desires of the district
3976786 i think theres been some leadership missing im an independent guy i stand up id make sure the district is getting its fair share of stuff im not sure were getting what we deserve
3976787 id open up the lines of communication between people ive had people say theyre not getting calls back from council people leadership is more than just a word
3976788 in the 5th district we intend to maintain the strong effort on enforcement that has led to the cleaning up of 12 street corners that notoriously served as headquarters for drug and crime activity
3976789 the crackdown on graffiti and other so called minor crime helps keep more serious crime at bay the police respond quickly efficiently and professionally to any call and we will support improved communications and logistics to enhance what is already successful
3976790 its just making sure we have responsible growth which encompasses several other key components like affordable housing and police and fire presence which increase as the population increases
3976791 infrastructure is a part of that as well the more people you have using more public infrastructure youre going to have to attend to maintenance and building new infrastructure
3976792 that comes into planning really sitting down and coming up with a plan of how to address those things before they hit you you begin with the budget but also with the departments where are we and how do we position ourselves to handle additional growth in the population
3976793 right now the city is in good shape ive always thought that
3976794 i thought that before the current mayor got in people are coming back to the city i think we need to continue to encourage more home ownership which is good and raises the tax base
3976795 but we need to keep tax rates low assessments go up which is good thing but we cant chase people out of the city with tax rates id like to see if we can cap tax rates for seniors
3976796 i think the first step is to have people present on council and a mayor that residents can have faith that theyre there to really turn it around and to get projects accomplished and to run things in a truly responsible way
3976797 short of that its just getting out and meeting people and shaking hands putting ideas forward and pursing them and getting them interested in partnering with city
3976798 weve got to do it as tri city area not just as richmond chesterfield or henrico some things would benefit all of us but would take all to come up with ideas and pay for it
3976799 apart from stony point mall carytown is the largest shopping center in town and the venue for the annual watermelon festival the largest one day festival on the east coast
3976800 provision of such simple amenities such as new trash containers street paving bicycle racks and sidewalk clean ups will keep people flocking to this vital area which puts so much back into the city
3976801 i want jobs for our city and job stability and homes people can afford to live in
3976802 these are economic issues and the surest way to get there is to have a strong and growing business base
3976803 as a council member our input into the management of schools is basically through fiscal management
3976804 i will continue to scrutinize school budgets to cut what is unnecessary and to increase what works and what makes life more promising for our young people
3976805 my experiences have really opened my eyes to some of the issues that should be addressed and i do believe that i could be a good part of helping richmond public schools to continue in a positive direction
3976806 there are some problems but there are some very positive things that we can also continue to grow on as we change the negative things that are affecting our school system
3976807 the only way to do that is to enforce the student code of conduct and we have to implement safety initiatives that provide alternatives for aggressive behavior
3976808 we have a lot of young people that have a lot of aggressive behavior we need to address these issues and find out whats causing it we need to sit down with them and come to some understanding we have to be very firm on discipline because with that i think we can establish a rapport of respect
3976809 a new school will provide economic benefits to the entire community because where there are good schools they will attract businesses and good businesses attract people who want to move into the city and make their home in city
3976810 i do believe that if we were to partner with others we would have large range of support and opportunities for our kids in our system
3976811 i think if business leaders are involved they would be able to educate kids in the area of business and let them know certain things that are expected to maintain decent employment in the future
3976812 civically it would let them know each of them have responsibility for our community to do what we can as an adult or a child to help make our community a better place to live

3976815 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
3976816 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3976826 the ibm hci study clearly calls for the same rigor in talent analytics and management that ceos and cios require to make the strategic decisions their companies depend on
3976827 the challenge laid out for ibms clients is to treat their most valuable asset their people as their most competitive edge
3976828 the long term payoffs of strong talent management far outweigh the costs and complexities associated with upfront investments
3976829 this research proves that in todays increasingly globalized technology driven economy a strategic and integrated focus on talent can in fact help your organization prepare for corporate adolescence and financially outperform competitors no matter the size or industry

3976834 so when power went out i just assumed it was a simple case of oh well here we go again
3976835 that turned out obviously not to be true and we had a much more serious problem
3976836 i know i virtually lived at command headquarters for many days
3976837 and it was very rewarding to see how people pulled together i mean people didnt point fingers or blame they just got on with solving the problem
3976838 the blackout brought everything together around the kind of indecision that was beginning to form about the eves government
3976839 i think the decline and the image was already there and this was just another piece of evidence for the public at least they interpreted it that way that he was not a good public manager
3976840 well if i knew the answer to all those questions i might still be there
3976841 quite seriously its hard to say i mean i dont think you can take one specific thing
3976842 i dont think that you can possibly rule out every eventuality but i think all of the objective analysis points to the province of ontario being involved in a pretty substantial renaissance of its electricity system
3976843 if you had a major transmission failure in the united states it would ricochet into ontario
3976844 as it is there isnt enough transmission right now to carry some of the proposed electricity to where its needed so is it likely to be imminent no could it happen again sure could
3976845 not only is premier dalton mcguintys government not prepared for the unexpected theyre not even preparing for the expected which is a shortage of energy going forward

3976849 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3976850 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3976851 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3976852 this is going a lot better than the last time i was here
3976853 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3976854 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3976855 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3976856 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3976857 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3976858 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3976859 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3976860 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3976861 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3976862 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3976863 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3976864 we apologise for the dismay caused by the shooting we assure the residents there it will not happen again
3976865 we had no choice as the traps set up in the area could not handle the number of monkeys roaming around the residential area there were thousands of monkeys with some disturbing the residents and invading swimming pools
3976866 we disturbed the ecological system and this is the result like it or not we have to make room for the monkeys
3976867 where else can they go to look for food if they do not rummage through our rubbish
3976868 my car got scratched because the monkeys liked to sit on the hood and i have to wash my car daily my maid has been cleaning up after the monkeys
3976869 it has been a way of life for my family it is only fair we allow the monkeys to roam the are here because we stole their homes from them
3976870 a better way would be to seek help from trained animal specialists
3976871 no doubt the monkeys have been a nuisance but we must remember that we are the ones who have ousted them from their natural habitat
3976872 so what we expect the monkeys to do when they also need to search for food i am simply speechless at the extreme measures used such as shooting the monkeys
3976873 the monkeys who live in and around medan damansara do not number in the thousands at the very most there are about 100 monkeys
3976874 the monkeys could easily have been caught over a period of time and relocated to other places such as templers park
3976875 we heard gunshots around lunchtime and to our horror saw a dying monkey hanging from a tree near our house several hours later
3976876 malaysias monkey situation is not unique and we can learn from the experience of neighbouring countries such as singapore indonesia and hong kong
3976877 they have situations which are very much similar to ours culling is not an effective method as the causative problem has not been addressed
3976878 tonys a great competitor in a great many ways because hes tough but hes also respectful hes been a good friend on and off the racetrack specifically off hes done a lot to help me and guide me hes an indiana boy so i have a different respect for him because of that but in general hes just a hard nosed racer and ive always appreciated him for that whether we argue on the racetrack or not were two hard nosed racers
3976879 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3976880 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3976881 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3976882 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3976883 the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3976884 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3976885 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
3976886 very clear eyed about his relationship with the russian leaders
3976887 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3976888 it is simply not a requirement of this mission and it is not something we are seeking to do
3976889 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
3976890 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3976891 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3976892 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3976893 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3976894 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
3976895 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
3976896 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
3976897 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
3976898 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
3976899 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
3976900 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
3976901 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
3976902 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier
3976903 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3976904 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
3976905 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
3976906 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction

3976923 its gone very well its pretty stress free compared to past records where wed been in there for months and gone over time and budget martin s skaroupka very aggressive our new drummer and hes only 25 so hes really pushed the album on the aggression side of it hes a real asset to the band right now
3976924 its just basically dani filth guitar writing the music the lyrics everything weve all had ideas but 99 percent of it is kind of paul s baby now and in that way hes probably stressed out but there arent five people around him all stressed out were trying to stick to deadline and budge and for the first time in a long time trying to deliver on time its very stressful its about 95 percent done when we get to the studio theres no way were going to pay 600 pounds a day when were still scratching our heads wondering what should come next but to be honest its never finished until its finished things can get changed last minute you can drop a lead guitar part you can add sing over parts its recorded right up until the mastering even though its like skeletons there its still getting flushed out every day were not closed minded you have to be sort of flexible
3976925 it depends what theyre saying you either get angry towards it or you find it funny it depends what kind of mood youre in i guess were not a very good band to go around getting offended when weve got the jesus is a cunt shirt there are laws against that now there are certain things you can definitely not get away with if we went to the merchandise company and said this is the t shirt that were going to sell im not sure if they would just refuse it but it was done years ago when we didnt have anyone telling us what to do i wasnt in the band back then but i remember it coming out and causing a bit of a fuss
3976926 i think with the last record there was more of an actual anticipation i guess because we already had a record and then everyone kind of wanted to hear what the next record was

3976935 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3976936 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3976937 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3976938 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
3976939 there seem to be a particularly large crop of books about obama
3976940 what is he like as a family man how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock star persona that he has been able to create
3976941 this young audience all of which had grown up essentially with one president all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that i thought was galvanizing
3976942 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read

3976944 williams notes that if physical size is such an important consideration the current vice president shouldnt have been selected it should be pointed out that cheneys political career began in wyoming the least populous state in the nation with fewer than 525 000 residents its less than half the size of the richmond metro area
3976945 ok pick it up now if sweat it not dripping down your buttcrack or through your man boobs you are not getting a work out
3976946 excessive caloric expenditure has limited implications for substantially reducing body weight independent of nutritional modifications
3976947 we get a tremendous amount of pressure to eat for reasons other than nurturing ourselves and over time people lose sensitivity to hunger fullness appetite signals meant to keep them healthy and well nourished its hard for people to come to a healthy sense of themselves given the cultural climate and nutritious and pleasurable options for healthy food are not as easily accessible as less nutritious
3976948 compared with those that gained some of their weight back the women who were able to sustain a weight loss of 10 percent of their initial weight for two years exercised consistently and regularly about 275 minutes a week or fifty five minutes of exercise at least five days a week
3976949 2003 is considered the 21st century quick history lesson thats when we invaded iraq just clarifying because you just looked really dumb
3976950 in the 21st century one nation does not invade another nation with the intent of overthrowing the ruling government
3976951 look what he did he smeared all over the place
3976952 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3976953 to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
3976954 now lets go and kick the out of those iranians
3976955 in the 21st century nations dont invade other countries in europe

3976966 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3976967 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3976968 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3976969 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3976970 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3976971 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3976972 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3976973 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3976974 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3976975 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3976979 i just kept it in my head that my dear generals eyes would be watching over me and that encouraged me to lift this weight
3976980 i am overjoyed by the fact that i have brought great joy to our dear leader this is the biggest present for the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the republic
3976981 i wanted to bring joy to the people of the dprk but i failed to do so

3976989 pay no attention to those overprivileged banks behind the curtain the ones interest from the economy in exchange for the nothing out of which they create the money they loan look only at those being quietly and systematically fleeced and defrauded by a system set up by and for bankers and pretend that its all their fault that this is being done to them

3976992 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3977012 provides visitors a new perspective of the forest from the canopy of trees experience being one with the forest and a chance to observe wildlife at close range the tour comprises of flying up to 100 feet high through a series of motorized cable rides and viewing the forest from different platforms on tree tops
3977013 i guess it is primarily my love for engineering and its application to nature making nature more accessible to people without disturbing it
3977014 the idea for the motorized cable ride came from costa rica whose tourism industry depends a lot on its canopy walk attraction but to make it different i had it motorized i think we are among the few if not the only one to have this feature
3977015 tea eggs are simply hard boiled eggs that have been further stewed in a salted tea liquid other flavorings such as soy sauce and chinese five spice powder are often added as well the dark color of the tea also stains through the cracks of the eggs creating a pattern on the peeled eggs that resembles the crazing of some ceramic glaze surfaces
3977016 the temples most outstanding artistic and perhaps spiritual feature is the distinguished finely crafted statues of the 500 luohans buddhist arhats or enlightened ones sculpted by the brilliant artist li guangxiu a famous folk clay artist from sichuan province he took his students to kunming where they spent seven years 1883 1890 preparing the sculptures regarded as a pearl in the treasure house of oriental sculpture these life size clay figures came from li guangxius and his apprentices deep study of people and their inner personalities after seven years of study and work the immense undertaking was completed each of the statues represents an aspect of human life with great accuracy and skill and looks just like a real person frozen in a moment in time
3977017 we need to sell all 2 1 million tons by sept 30 to prepare warehouse space for the next buying scheme due to start in november

3977019 production has peaked and there will be no more rice for us to buy by sept 30
3977020 the final decision will be made by the prime minister

3977022 these are very well engineered cars that are reliable fairly easy to work on and extremely fun to drive whether cruising at highway speeds or driving over winding roads
3977023 the interior is roomy with good vision and lots of room for four adults as well the e28 was the last of the distinctive classic boxy upright five series designs that gave way to the more contemporary aerodynamic forms
3977024 during the restoration i ordered an m technic front bumper spoiler from a european version of the e12 called the m353i and an euro rear bumper to slim the car down to its original classic design intent
3977025 yeah but in the united states ford sells a less expensive se version of the flex and it starts at 28 995
3977026 racing always depends on sponsorship i think that im going to be at gem but its racing and things happen pretty quickly i hope that the sponsors are happy enough to keep me for next year and i hope gillett evernham is happy as well because i like being here and i like driving this car
3977027 im having so much fun that i dont let whats happening with the race car or my contract bother me too much
3977028 i just go racing and focus on what i have to do and just have fun and its working for now if it is meant to happen its going to happen
3977029 the last five races and ever since we won the pole in loudon its given us a little bit more confidence and now were running top 20 a little bit more
3977030 im starting to battle with these cup drivers a little bit more where i couldnt early on
3977031 its like the car got a little smaller again i think its happening at the right time and i think the team can see it as well
3977032 plus we are starting to go back to tracks that weve raced at earlier this year so if we can bring as good a race car as weve had the last five races i think well have some more fun
3977033 nascar is the most fun ive ever had racing im enjoying myself more then i ever had in the past in racing i just appreciate the moment
3977034 we race in front of crowds that are unbelievable to be able to be a part of the sprint cup series i feel like a pretty fortunate guy
3977035 when i stopped racing open wheel in 2005 its because i decided to stop i like nascar i like the ovals and thats what i want to do
3977036 the irl is going away from ovals and for me i have no interest in going back
3977037 theres no agreement yet but we are making some progress
3977038 it feels like a weight off my shoulders it really does i felt like ive been trying so hard to win ive been tripping over myself
3977039 weve come close and run fast but havent been able to close the deal i knew that the road races this year was my best chance to win and im just really pleased ive had to be patient
3977040 i told him that he didnt need to pass him to win i told him several times he didnt need to pass him just so he knew there was no use taking any chances because he had a significant enough lead
3977041 ive dragged my family a long way away from immediate friends and family down home and its just a lot of commitment when you have a weekend like this it just validates the choices that ive made to come across here and have a go at it
3977042 in 1988 i had a choice of going to university or a local college and a car i decided on the college and car and my grandmother bought me a 1987 camaro
3977043 its never been restored never messed with there are some dents and dings here and there but the paint is original
3977044 the engine in the tiguan is sideways while the q5 is longitudinal just like in the a4 so theres really not that much shared
3977045 nothing speaks to the primacy of tv over the internet this year like the record 5 million and 6 million spent by the obama and mccain campaigns respectively in advertising buys on the olympics follow the money if you want to know what the candidates and their handlers really believe in and its tv not the internet that comes first
3977046 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3977047 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3977048 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3977049 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3977050 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3977051 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3977052 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3977053 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3977054 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3977055 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3977056 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3977057 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3977058 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3977059 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3977060 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3977061 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3977062 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3977063 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3977064 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3977065 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3977066 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3977067 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3977068 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3977069 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3977070 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state
3977071 the district commissioner of al multaqa district abdul kareem ali nasif and three of his guards were wounded by a suicide car bomb that targeted the convoy of nasif while he was going to his office district in al multaqa district west of kirkuk early morning
3977072 abdul karim al jubouri also leads pro u s security vonteer forces in the area was wounded along with three bodyguards
3977073 he tried to head towards us but we were careful because suicidal attackers are common in diyala

3977105 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3977106 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3977107 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
3977108 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
3977109 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
3977110 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3977111 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
3977112 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
3977113 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3977114 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers
3977115 campbells would represent a nice fit with the company were always looking for opportunities to expand and grow
3977116 their lives are at stake it means a lot to me to be the one helping out with peoples health care and well being
3977117 i wanted to do an internship to get a more in depth exposure to the corporate workplace and culture
3977118 pncs culture is very welcoming to new employees and interns
3977119 they have really treated me like a real employee ive been researching historical stock prices and working on charts that theyll be using for investor presentations
3977120 it makes me feel good to do work that is providing some value to them
3977121 these internships are more than just a way to spend the summer
3977122 they make the person broader and a much more attractive candidate for employment
3977123 the ties fame creates in this region increases immeasurably the likelihood that bright african americans will stay in the area
3977124 we want to educate young people and change corporate diversity in pittsburgh
3977125 theres a lack of understanding of how deep the culture of the inner city area goes
3977126 in these neighborhoods theres a sense of hopelessness due to limited means
3977127 ive never seen wealth like that or such determination and focus on academics
3977128 it also gives you an understanding of whether a job is where you want to start your career and allows you to experiment with what you want to do
3977129 there are stereotypes of running to make coffee but ive learned so much
3977130 fame pointed me in the right direction and let me know i had the skills to succeed without fame i wouldnt have known about this and wouldnt have had the opportunity
3977131 i know that their education is going to be top notch
3977132 education is the separator in terms of the job market and how highly skilled you are
3977133 we are educating them to be future leaders the possibilities are endless
3977134 taking tests buying books any preparation youre doing can make the process expensive but especially the college visits
3977135 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3977136 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3977137 my people on vulcan have been playing this game for ages
3977138 helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold
3977139 id like to think that very same imagination is what fuels my desire and drive as a game designer
3977140 laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one

3977152 our people they work in the community they live in the community they work at starbucks they work at safeway they have a life
3977153 were all unfortunately living and working in a community with less and less dollars
3977154 lets take the limited resources we have and get the most bang for the buck
3977155 if we didnt get the funding we did we werent sure we could continue
3977156 we were very very very very happy there were screams and dances im still on a little bit of a high
3977157 its great when you dream of new programs and then you have the funding to actually implement them
3977158 we expect to see parents receiving more information more support in raising their children
3977159 we expect to see friendships arise ultimately that helps ease the challenge of raising children with special needs
3977160 its not the first time weve had funding cut from one of our sources so we know how to deal with it and move on
3977161 were certainly going to continue to serve the kids that we serve
3977162 it just makes it a little more difficult for us to do so
3977163 theres still a great deal of strength in terms of the number of tourists who are coming to san francisco and in particular passengers who are coming through san francisco international airport
3977164 however were not seeing the same kind of growth in the hotel daily rates and in the average hotel occupancy in fact our hotel occupancy has actually slipped from may of this year as compared to may of last year

3977174 forget regret or life is yours to miss no other road no other way no day but today
3977175 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
3977176 it was short it was sweet like always there are tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far well have another test tomorrow night
3977177 i think the second and third preseason games you learn a lot more about your offense because the starters will be playing longer
3977178 philly last year we went up there and didnt really have a good showing so that is something we will be thinking about breaking camp will definitely lift our spirits
3977179 but you know last years first preseason game we did some good things and when we went up to philly we laid an egg we played awful so we have to go back to work
3977180 if we were doing the injury report it would be questionable
3977181 you always have a couple of guys that you wish things didnt happen to well leave some guys behind but for the most part we made it through with nothing real severe
3977182 they have worked hard i think we have had a good camp i think they are enjoying football and they are focused and their work ethic has been good i think if we were going another week in spartanburg it might be a different story but for where we are and getting them out here right now is about right
3977183 a lot of these kids have never been to a pga tour event
3977184 but theyve arranged to have a hospitality suite for us near the 17th green and its all going to be kid friendly food and drinks
3977185 obviously thats something we had in mind to extend this golf tournament and we certainly want to keep wyndham worldwide as our title sponsor
3977186 dear crappy i just came back from a business trip to kansas city on midwest airlines the airlines magazine featured this article on areas along the 7 trains route i just dont know quite what to say about it i guess theyre trying to portray these bits of queens as exotic spectacles suitable for tourists however i dont think the average tourist will find it quite as easy to navigate through large tracts of queens as say the coffee shops of seattle or the countrys most interesting presidential libraries which were some of the other stories in that issue of the magazine anyway just thought you might be interested in seeing how queens is being marketed to our midwestern friends lucky number 7 best regards and keep up the interesting blogging
3977187 the secretary general is aware of the situation we are monitoring it
3977188 we dont have any extensive comment to make on this at this stage
3977189 i believe our human rights colleagues in geneva are also aware of this and are determining whether to make any comment i dont have anything further to say at present
3977190 we needed to have an offensive night like this that is huge for us
3977191 more than anything he is learning learning the pitchers and learning what to do in the clubhouse i know it has been a good experience for him we cant expect him to do anything more
3977192 the bullpen has been getting up and down a lot
3977193 it made sense to take me out but i would have liked to go one more inning
3977194 he couldnt throw anything for a strike and just got hit around by a good team
3977195 especially right now its a big deal because weve been grinding for a couple of weeks
3977196 just getting a chance to go with the guys and do something other than football was a lot of fun especially the competition between the offense and the defense
3977197 that was a great time we were all just cheering each other on and trying to distract the other guys i think there were almost a couple of fights at the end but it was fun
3977198 we had a team meeting at 8 oclock but no one knew what it was about
3977199 im sure he had a lot of gutter balls i guess hes just that bad of a bowler thank god i didnt get a chance to see it because that would have been rough to watch
3977200 theres some little bitty things that weve got to cover
3977201 you cant just tokenly pay attention to it one time and say im sure weve got that and if it happens in the first ballgame well be able to handle it
3977202 the teams moving along but were still a long ways away from where we need to be on opening day
3977203 first of all weve been waiting for this game for the last two years
3977204 im pretty sure im sick and tired and they are sick and tired of hearing about greece but we just got to approach it as another game another team thats in our way for the gold medal
3977205 i remember that we missed a ton of free throws 14 of 34
3977206 and the pick and roll game we couldnt adjust to the pick and roll game by the time we adjusted the game was over
3977207 i was stunned if you can see the footage from that game i didnt want to get off the court after the game
3977208 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say thats none of my business i want people to know that 16 is my real age
3977209 i was with my team it was an ordinary day we just celebrate with our teammates
3977210 i have no proof so much talk could be because one little girl has a missing tooth
3977211 if its true its totally unfair certain countries go by rules and certain countries may not
3977212 when alicia began this sport she was a very emotional athlete but over time she has become consistent but she had to wait before the beam and it looks like she flew back to her original state
3977213 she was very upset going over to the floor alicia couldnt get over it we always say turn the page but sometimes it is hard to turn the page
3977214 just two days ago she had a stunning beam 15
3977215 we are proud of each other no matter what we do we are like a family we respect china we will wear our silver medals proudly
3977216 i can hang with the guys and be around my teammates
3977217 maybe it took a toll on me people say it did
3977218 thank you i didnt think i was ever going to get my car back for a second
3977219 if id have missed that thered definitely be a lot more skepticism about my future as a kicker here all the coaches wouldve had a lot more stress on them
3977220 the secretary general is aware of the situation we are monitoring it
3977221 we dont have any extensive comment to make on this at this stage
3977222 i believe our human rights colleagues in geneva are also aware of this and are determining whether to make any comment i dont have anything further to say at present
3977223 a world class motorsports facility that continues to provide a significant economic benefit to the community kansas speedway not only attracts hundreds of thousands of fans throughout the year but also serves as a catalyst for new development
3977224 i can definitely feel the difference than in past years
3977225 just by hearing what other players are saying they all love this place and its great that we are playing here this week
3977226 playing a ross course you really have to watch where you hit the ball on the greens because thats what makes his courses so difficult
3977227 it looks good and theres a good feel to it
3977228 im looking forward to it and i think the guys are going to love it
3977229 you really dont know how its going to go because the pin positions will be key
3977230 it might be a birdie fest because they cant keep the greens running too fast because of the heat
3977231 ill tell you what i havent heard and thats anything negative
3977232 obviously what they are going to say to me is different but what they are saying to the pga tour officials is all positive
3977233 weve always practiced that way for 28 years and i can honestly tell you i have never lost a quarterback in practice
3977234 we had runners in scoring position and i was just trying to hit one the other way
3977235 it was a surprise getting called up but im thankful for it
3977236 we had runners tonight and what matters is we got them in im glad i got to help and hopefully we can carry this on the road
3977237 right from when they hit it i knew hed be going home
3977238 i was just ready for a throw from sanchez hes got a good arm i got a high bounce so i barehanded it im glad i took the chance
3977239 i stopped worrying about getting a win and just kind of going out there and trusting my stuff and getting ahead of guys
3977240 i felt pretty good tonight i made a couple of bad pitches here and there but the blue rocks are a hot team especially with paulo over there tearing the cover off the ball and when you make a mistake to a good team theyll make you pay for it a lot of the time but my team really picked me up and i was fortunate to come out with the win
3977241 i think its confidence we made a few little corrections and set a goal to go 6 0 from that point on and thats basically what hes done
3977242 this is no oridinary football helmet as they show someone assembling the helmet face mask chin strap ect the last image put on it is the star on the side of the helmet where it is followed by this is a dallas cowboys helmet
3977243 we kind of got lost in our practice round discussing all the green complexes and what do you think was here before and how much we like the greens and how much we like the golf course
3977244 theyve all been kind of doctored up this is great to see a lot of the stuff he did still intact
3977245 its a donald ross golf course when he designed it but its not a donald ross golf course right now
3977246 its been redesigned so many different times i would like to know what donald ross golf course really was when he first designed it i dont think the greens were this severe or the fairways like this they must have redesigned a lot of the holes i have a few in jacksonville fla where i love playing it but theyre at their original state and nowadays you know its never in the original state you know just look at last week that never was a donald ross designed golf course
3977247 youve got long holes all the way to short holes
3977248 youve got 4 irons off the tee all the way to drivers its a variety pack it challenges your whole bag somebody which is a great compliment said this is like a hilly hilton head youve got to hit every club in your bag use every bit of your strategy and your course management youve got to hit every shot you know around the greens and thats the sign of a great golf course
3977249 playing defense for the past three years here helped me really adjust a little bit more to whats coming at me at times
3977250 but its still a major transition from playing defense to offense its a totally different technique and what youre trying to get done on the field
3977251 it kind of recharged my desire to play not that is was lacking but every days a new challenge and definitely fun
3977252 theyve added toughness to the line theyve added athletic ability
3977253 theyre still learning each and every day and you know theyre not perfect in any way shape or form but theyve given us some depth that we wouldnt have had
3977254 if someones struggling we kind of push the other person and kind of help him out here or there

3977267 tijdens de opwarming was het ook al niet zo denderend maar dat is eigenlijk geen indicatie soms zwem ik dan in de wedstrijd net goed
3977268 ik heb hier wel gemerkt dat ik op het ek in eindhoven veel heb geleerd bijvoorbeeld dat het echt nodig is om me beter te focussen op de wedstrijd

3977289 the company is so confident that consumers wont abandon beer
3977290 that it plans to increase prices for popular brands like budweiser and bud light to stay ahead of the higher costs
3977291 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3977292 didnt really have st as the name when we engaged in the process we were just calling it a sport truck
3977293 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
3977294 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
3977295 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
3977296 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3977297 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3977298 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3977299 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3977300 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3977301 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3977302 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3977303 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3977304 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3977305 were not looking to take over the world or change the way anybody else lives were just looking for equality

3977339 mis padres me dijeron que georgia iba a ser atacada y ahora no sabemos cu l va ser el futuro de mi pa s donde muchas zonas est n ocupadas por los rusos
3977340 el conflicto fue bastante extra o no me interesa mucho la pol tica y adem s cuando existen enfrentamientos entre peque os territorios rusia siempre tiene que formar parte algo que no siempre es bueno

3977354 george bush often displays a similarly manichean worldview which may be why the two men get on as well as they do both bush and blair are instinctive politicians who attach great importance to personal relationships
3977355 in times of uncertainty journalism of the left must not accept the status quo
3977356 the third way has become the only mainstream way the everything and the nothing

3977359 it is strange when politicians urge protesters to urge the politicians to do more but that is the state of play as gleneagles approaches

3977379 both books set out similar themes on relations with the us neither book falls into the lazy clich ridden trap of painting blair as bushs poodle both highlight how blairs determination to deal with iraq and wmd preceded bushs election and became very much his own area of expertise kampfner notes that blair was not dragged into war against iraq he was at ease with himself and his own beliefs blair appears to have been amongst the quickest of world leaders to come to terms with september 11th and think through how the americans would react but why then back the us over iraq and what deal was done and what influence did blair think he could wield kampfner provides the most damning summing up of blairs approach to iraq his other conflicts and foreign policy it was a mixture of self confidence and fear of atlanticism evangelism gladstonian idealism his was a combination of naivety and hubris p351

3977396 the more senate democrats there are the better for business and the better for the country

3977400 ooh i didnt know you could make statements about the stdev of non normal distributions thats pretty cool
3977401 at least 8 9s of the values in p will be within the range m 3
3977402 we dont need to square the values to make them positive we can just take the absolute value we need to square the values because the variance the square of the standard deviation is the unique measure of spread that is additive that is the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of the variances a very useful property thats perhaps a little advanced an explanation for a post on the basics but thats no excuse for misinformation
3977403 every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands hoist the black flag and begin to slit throats
3977404 im not even convinced there needs to be an anti religious element to the mission of dawkins harris and hitchens et al i think a concerted effort to push reason alone will as a potent side effect undermine the fear and ignorance that nourishes superstition
3977405 but we dont have eventually we have a concerted movement by religious fanatics to take over the country like at dover

3977415 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
3977416 the american military has made clear it doesnt want israeli military action at this time
3977417 the fbi is focusing on a contractor that worked with the cia
3977418 cia is in this anthrax business too though presumably only through contractors but we dont know how many contractors one contractor is now publicly disclosed battelle that did one of those projects
3977419 we dont know how many contractors were working on anthrax projects for the cia we dont know how many projects
3977420 dr barbara rosenberg an acknowledged authority on us bio defence claimed
3977421 cia officials have said they are certain the anthrax used in the mailings did not come from their work that none of it is missing and that the small amount in their possession was not milled into powder form

3977425 the district court is a creature of statute and it follows the power to make the order must be derived from a statutory provision
3977426 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
3977427 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
3977428 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
3977429 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts
3977430 something obama has done almost every day since he arrived in kenya last week
3977431 i think odinga has to look at critically where he is receiving his advice from just because somebody wants to run for president and he is using senator obama as his stooge as his puppet to be able to get where he wants to get
3977432 for their own separate reasons odinga and sheik abdullah abdi joined forces
3977433 sheik abdullah abdi agreed to swing islamic voters to odinga in kenya and odinga agreed to support islam should he become president
3977434 by endorsing raila odinga during his 2006 visit to kenya obama positioned himself to be seen by kenyans as an important u s senator who was joining forces with his luo tribal kinsman this positioning further sided obama with raila odinga as he ran against president mwai kibaki in the december 2007 presidential election in kenya

3977532 boleh jadi kamu membenci sesuatu padahal ia amat baik bagimu dan boleh jadi pula kamu menyukai sesuatu padahal ia amat buruk bagimu allah mengetahui sedang kami tidak mengetahui
3977533 pada pecahan berikutnya bermakna umum untuk segala sesuatu lalu bagaimana manusia bisa memahami bahwa sesuatu itu secara hakiki adalah mashlahat secara umum tatkala manusia menetapkan baik buruk bisa dilihat dari tiga aspek yang menonjol
3977534 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasulnya sunnah jika kami benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian
3977535 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada allah
3977536 dan barangsiapa berpaling dari peringatan ku maka sesungguhnya baginya penghidupan yang sempit dan kami akan menghimpunkannya pada hari kiamat dalam keadaan buta

3977553 ive said it before and ill say it again any extremes of any political sort is dangerous
3977554 una vez se recaben todas las pruebas entraremos a hacer la evaluaci n correspondiente
3977555 i mean what is the deal with the conservatives and this guy
3977556 i mean if anyone is qualified to be president on the republican side its this guy
3977557 why do the conservatives hate this guy so much that theyll do anything to destroy him
3977558 no s lo atento sino ansioso de acudir a un llamado de un juez o un fiscal ecuatoriano en el proceso que quieran promover por injuria o calumnia
3977559 ahora como se ha vuelto habitual o costumbre cada vez que le abrimos investigaci n a alguien y tenemos que absolver unas dudas resultan denunciando a los fiscales a los jueces e incluso al fiscal general
3977560 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3977561 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that
3977562 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3977563 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3977564 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3977565 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3977566 ive been able to find what works and doesnt work and been able to do it on a small stage and not have to have the growing pains hopefully at the nhl level
3977567 ini adalah kesempatan besar bagi merek merek fashion untuk terlibat dalam sesuatu yang besar dan heroik

3977569 was the soldier who left his weapon lying around court martialed
3977570 everybody came charging onto the field to win it in the end it made everything really worth while
3977571 ive been doing this for awhile so im very familiar with playing competitive baseball with travel teams
3977572 what you base your team on is pitching and how deep you have pitching and also on offensive power everybody will make errors because everybody is human
3977573 what picks you up is your power and your pitching i knew from the get go that this was going to be one of the best teams weve had because of how much we had of each
3977574 a lot of the bigger colleges are represented here plus a lot of the better smaller schools
3977575 also this gives guys a chance to stay home with their families work and also play a high caliber of baseball
3977576 the objective is to give them work so that when they go back to school theyre better players
3977577 she decided why not play fox chapel and we ended up meeting in the final
3977578 it was ironic it was a good match but neither of us wanted to offend the other i didnt want to get too pumped up
3977579 im good friends with him and this is the first time ive ever beaten him hes such a good player he was not too happy about it but he was a great sport about it it made my day
3977580 i do what i have to do to beat the guy
3977581 i play all the time im out there eight hours a day so i just know the courts
3977582 i have a big serve and a big forehand and my backhand is improving a lot i definitely need to improve on my volleys and net game and my second serve
3977583 i always set goals and once i complete them i set them higher
3977584 what is next well the ultimate goal is definitely a scholarship to a d i college and to fulfill that goal im going to need to make my ranking a lot higher than it is now at least to get into the schools i want to get into
3977585 the interesting thing is beyond the numbers of course which i think we have 415 matches
3977586 its just a real festival kids love to come and we dont set any qualifications if you enter by the deadline youre in simple as that its really a community wide event
3977587 i used to shoot around 36 or 38 for nine holes but now its around 45 or 46 my game isnt like it should be at my age but im getting my swing back to what it used to be gradually ill be there
3977588 i was surprised about it that was neat that was great
3977589 i enjoyed the fellows and the nice cake it was a nice get together
3977590 hes such a nice man always friendly and talking to everyone
3977591 theres no arguments nothing like that we have a great time the fellows are all friendly as can be
3977592 let me put it this way some of them are pretty slow playing
3977593 some people in the league say you better not put me behind the skinners
3977594 to play 18 is only 5 60 thats very reasonable for seniors to play most places you go anymore you pay 35 or 45
3977595 the main thing is if you dont have your health you have nothing
3977596 im a millionaire when it comes to health no problems whatsoever thats really something
3977597 im having no problems paying my bills im just enjoying life
3977598 ive had a wonderful life and a number of lady friends after my wife passed away i have a lady friend now who is 84 and im 94 we enjoy each others company so thats a lot of fun too
3977599 heres the main thing in life youve got to keep busy and being alone is no fun either so i met up with a wonderful lady at church whitehall presbyterian and weve been together now for a whole year
3977600 i practice when i get a chance im going to get my game up to where its decent
3977601 im working on my golf swing now and its improving right along here and there ill hit a few bad shots but in general i hit the ball pretty good for my age
3977602 i had heard how good a lot of the teams were but i also thought this was definitely winnable for us as soon as we got out there we clicked right away
3977603 ive been doing this for awhile so im very familiar with playing competitive baseball with travel teams
3977604 what you base your team off of is pitching and how deep you have pitching and also on offensive power everybody will make errors because everybody is human what picks you up is your power and your pitching
3977605 there are some great baseball players here im not going to say just good theyre great
3977606 is everybody going to get drafted no but are there players who are going to have a very successful college careers most definitely
3977607 a lot of the bigger colleges are represented here plus of a lot of the better smaller schools
3977608 also this gives guys a chance to stay home with their families work and also play a high caliber of baseball
3977609 i thought that it would definitely help me with the competition id be facing
3977610 i shows me what i need to do to play at that level and im glad i did it
3977611 i cant say enough about the kids and the performance they turned in this season im very proud of them
3977612 we tied for seventh place in the eight team bracket and finished the season with a 27 6 record
3977613 thats a significant accomplishment when you consider we had a relatively new roster we only had five kids back from last years team
3977614 the western region includes teams from state college to the ohio border
3977615 we played five games in five days and had a 4 1 record we beat punxsutawney in the title game july 30 had one day off then left for valley forge on friday morning
3977616 we had to drive 1 hour and 47 minutes each day then drive back home after the game
3977617 we put in a lot of time on the road but it was well worth it
3977618 we won the north division then beat greensburg in two games to win the league championship
3977619 i have to give a lot of credit to whitey gralewski
3977620 he has been in charge of shalers booster club for 25 years even though he hasnt had a son involved in legion ball for more than 20 years hes in charge of our concession stand and responsible for raising any money we need for the postseason he does a great job and we really appreciate it
3977621 we have 17 players on our roster and everybody played in the regional and state tournaments
3977622 ive been fortunate to have such a good group of kids the past two years
3977623 matt is a five tool player who has a cannon for an arm
3977624 zack had only two runners try to steal a base on him in 33 games ben was phenomenal at shortstop
3977625 when you consider what this team has done this year and last year its easy to see that shalers high school team will be formidable in the upcoming years
3977626 all sit under their own vines and fig trees and no one shall make them afraid
3977627 je suis celui qui va vous dire si vous pouvez avoir la p ridurale
3977628 at this point in the season every game is big
3977629 we have to make up for it we have turn things around
3977630 i left it up a little bit and he put a good swing on it
3977631 he seemed to be having an easy time with us and no one should have an easy time with us
3977632 you have to be able to score runs to win games

3977665 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3977666 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3977667 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3977668 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3977669 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3977670 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3977671 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3977672 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3977673 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3977680 i was living on my ranch and my life revolved around sex and drugs i wasnt happy though and one night i had a religious experience and was born again as a christian
3977681 i had gone in my fur loincloth and wig the girls loved it everywhere i walked they were patting my butt i could have held a thousand women in my arms that day and yet i walked out of there sad it was the shallowness i was being seen all over the world but never as myself
3977682 i fell to my knees there in that room and allowed jesus to take control of my life
3977683 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life

3977689 i dont consider him to be a nut i consider him to be a religious zealot
3977690 a little on the fanatical side he meant well but he took the wrong approach
3977691 he represents the most unusual investigations ive ever been on because we dont generally end up investigating people who are so well known as this guy
3977692 although many people didnt know his name they knew who he was simply by the fact that he was on television

3977697 forgive them lord for they know not what theyre doing
3977698 this man would not let any crime get in the way of getting his message out

3977809 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3977810 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
3977811 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
3977812 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3977813 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
3977814 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
3977815 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
3977816 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
3977817 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
3977818 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
3977819 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
3977820 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
3977821 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
3977822 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
3977823 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
3977824 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
3977825 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
3977826 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
3977827 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
3977828 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
3977829 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
3977830 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
3977831 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
3977832 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these

3977835 we anticipate oman investment fund partnering in future investment opportunities with quinlan private
3977836 traditionally sovereign funds look for long term growth and liquidity in stocks which are also sizeable crh bank of ireland and aib would also provide global exposure to such a fund
3977837 generally these funds also look for trophy assets for example trump tower and we dont have many of those
3977838 sovereign funds are certainly something that we have been looking at
3977839 we have been building relationships with these funds and assessing their appetite for investments in the irish market there is certainly anecdotal evidence that they would be interested in large infrastructural projects here
3977840 if the scale is there it doesnt matter if the opportunity is in ireland large scale infrastructure projects on the irish horizon include metro north a number of hospital projects road building and the toll roads as well as britain the swf is becoming more pronounced although the dubai sovereign wealth fund merseyside it recently walked away from a deal to invest in but dic already has considerable stakes in a number of uk companies including london stock exchange since 2007 swfs have spent an estimated 80bn 54bn bailing out banks desperately needing cash to repair balance sheets damaged by losses on bear stearns have all turned to swfs the chinese government owns a stake in us private equity giant taiwan tibet things where we are strategic competitors in a way and we dont agree does that mean were going to be obliged to react less strongly than we did before
3977841 buying into a football club might not be an issue but when it comes to a major utility or bank it could be
3977842 some have voiced political concerns but there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case
3977843 i dont think we ireland have anything to fear from these capital flows as a small open economy weve benefited from all forms of foreign investment
3977844 their job is to provide a diversified investment and they are generally run by professional people and have investment banks advising them
3977845 to a large extent swfs are more passive than some other investors in chinas case it was a bit unfortunate because one of its first investments was in the blackstone group which subsequently lost significant value
3977846 the opportunity of making large scale investments in western investment banks doesnt come along very often they have made these investments because it was a rare opportunity and one they could not turn down
3977847 but wealth funds have a mandate to make money not to plough money into ventures destined for collapse they are not charities they wont make investments unless they think they can make money
3977848 every last investor is cautious about us risk more than they were before the credit crunch
3977849 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site

3977853 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3977854 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3977855 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3977856 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3977857 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
3977858 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3977859 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
3977860 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
3977861 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
3977862 i promise that as president i will bring back the cast of touched by an angel under an executive order during these uncertain times we need all the help we can get and nothing helped me through the tumultuous 90s better than the hip feel good show i liked to call touched by an angel
3977863 my friends obama wants to shame americas way of life by having angela landsbury be the centerfold in an issue of playboy some call it retribution for the harmless pranks that occurred at the country club abu ghraib i promise that as president angela landsbury will remain the chaste and virgin role model our daughters can aspire to become

3977876 i think that statute is designed to prevent the very situation that mr davis complains of in his race and that i complain of in my race that is not letting the other party play the role of spoiler
3977877 contrary to what some are claiming tennessee does not have a true open primary
3977878 the ability of the republican party of tennessee to preserve itself as a viable political entity depends entirely upon the ability of the party members to control the party nomination process
3977879 signing an application for a ballot in a particular party primary
3977880 its not like we suddenly changed the rules its been this way forever
3977881 its not a secret this goes on occasionally the press talks about it but ive never heard it being argued as a means to challenge an election
3977882 thats not to say its not a valid argument the party executive committees can hear those arguments and make a decision
3977883 one absolute in this is that we do not know how people voted
3977884 you can make assumptions but we cant extract individual votes
3977885 in 35 years i could not find the thing that kept recycling being reinforced continually
3977886 for once youll get something back for doing something right
3977887 were trying to figure out a way to make it economically viable
3977888 personally im a big supporter id love to see it happen
3977889 were gearing up now with the trucks and the men
3977890 what recyclebank is going to bring to the table is incentive
3977891 people will turn their houses upside down looking for stuff to recycle
3977892 i might be inclined to keep doing what im doing
3977893 the only reason weve come here is because of a provokazia by mikheil saakashvili
3977894 they killed my neighbours 15 year old son everyone was fleeing in panic
3977895 the russian tanks arrived at our village at 11 20am we ran away we left everything our cattle our house and our possessions
3977896 they were killing burning and stealing my village isnt in a conflict zone its pure georgia
3977897 i believed him when he said there was peace thats why we stayed in our homes but it isnt true
3977898 so what youre doing is giving up access rights in one location to get them in another location
3977899 and the maintain and gain policy says that were going to have no net loss and preferably a net gain of public shoreline
3977900 due to the very small area affected by the proposed boat dock facility and ramp and due to the amount of unencumbered shoreline remaining on the adjacent properties approval of this proposal would have a minimum impact on the wildlife and other environmental considerations
3977901 fronts a shallow shoreline and is essentially a mud flat during a large portion of the year this situation renders the shore inaccessible to the back lying property except at the summer pool elevation area b is steep and inaccessible

3977906 ik weet dat er in frankrijk geen wet is die medische teams toelaat euthanasie te plegen dat verhindert me om vredig te leven de wet moet veranderen het probleem is dat u meneer nicolas sarkozy er niet over wil horen praten ik r my salvat vraag u om uw persoonlijke mening opzij te schuiven en te stoppen doof te zijn
3977907 om persoonlijke filosofische redenen geloof ik dat dit ons niet toebehoort dat wij het recht niet hebben om vrijwillig het leven te onderbreken
3977908 verder te gaan met zijn actie zodat er een echt publiek debat komt over het recht op euthanasie en geassisteerde zelfmoord
3977909 er zijn verschillende graden van bewaking dat kan gaan van geregelde politiepatrouilles langs de woning van de betrokkene tot close protection waarbij de geviseerde persoon dag en nacht wordt bewaakt zelfs familieleden worden dan in bepaalde gevallen begeleid wanneer ze de woning verlaten
3977910 je moet die zaken ernstig nemen maar niet in paniek slaan en er best zoveel mogelijk over zwijgen
3977911 de vraag groeit voortdurend en daarom zijn we op zoek naar nieuwe oppassers als we die niet snel vinden zullen we in de drukke winterperiode heel wat mensen niet kunnen helpen
3977912 wie voor 12u een aanvraag indient heeft normaal de dag nadien een oppas een doktersattest is altijd vereist
3977913 ook ouders of grootouders met ervaring of mensen met een pedagogische opleiding komen in aanmerking wie niet over een gepast diploma beschikt krijgt eerst een opleiding
3977914 het gaat echt om volwaardige contracten we bieden volledige kilometervergoeding gratis omniumverzekering en werkkledij
3977915 intussen zijn er 140 338 goedgekeurd een aantal dossiers zijn nog in beraad omdat we wachten op bijkomende info van het ministerie van financi n
3977916 het is de bedoeling om alles wat je nodig hebt in het onderwijs betaalbaar te maken daarom zijn de studietoelagen aangepast krijgen leerlingen gratis alle schoolgerief dat nodig is voor de eindtermen en is er een maximumfactuur voor schooluitstappen ingevoerd
3977917 nieuw is ook dat ouders voortaan hun studiebeurs met een gezinsdossier mogen aanvragen vroeger moesten ze voor elk kind apart een dossier indienen nu is n dossier voldoende dat vereenvoudigt de administratie
3977918 maar toch lieten ouders nog voor bijna 10 miljoen aan studietoelagen ongebruikt zowat 11 procent van het budget voor studiebeurzen het geld gaat wel niet verloren maar wordt in de pot van volgend jaar gestoken
3977919 ze zochten twee jonge kindjes in de leeftijdsklasse van mijn eigen zoon en dochter
3977920 kijk dat zijn die twee van die affiches naast de snelweg
3977921 ze zijn spontaner ik heb ze 10 minuutjes voor de achtergrond gezet in mijn eigen studio thuis titus met een voetbal ginger met haar fietshelm en fiets voor een campagne van een politieke partij zou ik nooit mijn eigen zoon en dochter laten poseren maar verkeersveiligheid is een belangrijk thema dat draagt een positieve boodschap uit ze rijden zelf nog niet met de fiets naar school de school ligt vrij ver en ginger kan pas zonder zijwieltjes fietsen maar gewoon op straat als voetganger kan er ook vanalles gebeuren
3977922 ik kan goed tekenen en mijn broer kan goed dansen

3977935 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3977936 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3977937 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
3977938 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3977939 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

3977952 desconocemos cu l es la tasa oficial de mortalidad infantil de 2007 en tucum n la tiene que sacar y difundir el ministerio de salud de la naci n pero tenemos un ndice aproximado de alrededor de 12 9 por cada mil nacidos vivos
3977953 centraliza todos los datos de todas las provincias y durante la elaboraci n de las estad sticas deben incluirse todos los hijos de tucumanos nacidos vivos o muertos en otras provincias y del mismo modo se procede con todas las provincias
3977954 en tucum n la tasa de mortalidad infantil no cambiar en forma significativa asegur y si la ministra graciela oca a anticip que en 2007 hubo m s muertes infantiles es porque seguramente debe avizorar que subir la tasa de mortalidad infantil nacional no nos olvidemos que la provincia de buenos aires donde habita el 40 de la poblaci n del pa s y las provincias de c rdoba y santa fe donde subi la mortalidad infantil y mendoza son las m s pobladas entonces aunque en otras provincias bajen las muertes infantiles al sacar el promedio nacional incidir n las tasas registradas en las tres grandes provincias y crecer la media nacional

3978037 when you come in you dont know exactly what the deal is or how much time youre going to get
3978038 youve got to make the most of your opportunities youre not really concerned when you first get here how much youre going to play youre more concerned with capitalizing on the opportunities you do get
3978039 and ive had more opportunities given to me so you want to show them you can play
3978040 i dont know when youre a player youre almost more critical of yourself than the coaches are you always look at little things that maybe coaches dont look at so i cant answer that question
3978041 i wont know what the deal is until opening day

3978044 she just said that someone has shot the chairman theres three shots i dont know who all has been hit or if theyre dead or what and so we called 911
3978045 he pulled and cocked the gun and pointed it at him and our building manager then ran down the way to get away from him

3978049 i didnt see the accident crash but i heard the sound and saw all the people in the big bus get off quickly
3978050 it was a pretty big noise like an explosion i thought some people might think it was a bombing or something thats why all the bus passengers tried to get out and get away
3978051 we asked police what we should do to help they were very panicked and didnt know what to do
3978052 then we saw three australians i dont think they were athletes probably a coach or something because they looked to be in their late 30s and i asked them im from australia is there anything i can do to help you
3978053 they said im ok but can you help me talk to these people inside the mangled mini van because he couldnt speak chinese and he saw some people still alive
3978054 he asked me to tell them to calm down not move and wait for the ambulance
3978055 the big australian guy he didnt mind he felt for their pulse
3978056 its amazing all the other people on the bus got down and tried to get away and there were more than a dozen police around the area but they were all at a loss
3978057 i dont know if chinese police have first aid training or not probably not because they didnt know what to do
3978058 i feel the australians made us proud my son it was the first time he saw real dead people and he said to me oh all the other people have gone its only us australians
3978059 you really feel proud when you see those things they didnt have any thought for their own safety they just wanted to look after injured people
3978060 it was a bit harrowing but you dont think about it too much it was an automatic reaction
3978061 it was pretty bad there were four passengers in the van we opened the door straight away and there was one guy convulsing we could get him out because there were no seats in the back of the van
3978062 the two guys in front of the van were trapped so we couldnt get them so we just made sure they were breathing
3978063 we havent got a specific weapon but it may have been an armchair or a lounge chair theres was a lounge chair with blood on it
3978064 it could be incorrect to say that the killer definitely only did it with their bare hands it couldve been several objects in the room but there is no specific weapon identified in the post mortems

3978070 taxes on plastic bags dont make sense for the environment
3978071 the overwhelming majority of states and cities that have looked at this issue have concluded that recycling is the sound solution for reducing waste and controlling litter
3978072 i didnt see any bags going out of there but i bet there were plenty leaving nordstrom and macys
3978073 if bags are bad arent all bags bad there just seem to be a lot of inconsistencies here
3978074 i want one every time i go to a fair theyre juicy and they taste really good

3978084 what is a friend a single soul dwelling in two bodies
3978085 and on one i missed that tackle it bothers me because i should have made it
3978086 there is a right way to do things and a wrong way
3978087 i have just always believed that no matter what i have done you do things the right way you do them the way theyre supposed to be done and you work hard until they are perfect
3978088 thats why i was so frustrated the other day after that scrimmage i understand why i am playing limited plays coaches talked to me about it and they are right we dont need me to get injured in camp but at the same time it goes against my nature to sit out and i dont like it i feel like every play every rep in drills is an opportunity to get better and im missing out on those chances to improve myself
3978089 after i missed that tackle on shady mccoy it was on my mind the whole entire day
3978090 it was one of those things that i just kept thinking that i have to get better i can t miss those tackles
3978091 im just like that i love to play football and i am a perfectionist and to me hard work and repetition is the only way ill get better if you want to be a good linebacker a great linebacker you just cant make any mistakes you have to get it right
3978092 i am willing to take all that responsibility on as a team leader you cant get all the accolades and not produce
3978093 but it isnt just about me producing if i have all those tackles again and our defense isnt good then i havent done my job i have to do my job and try to make this team better on every play and so the challenge is for me to try and take things to the next level it is my responsibility as a team leader to make sure i do whatever i can to help get pitt back to the top where it belongs

3978110 which one is the best which one do i need do i need this at all
3978111 in terms of sleeping rough it probably tends to predominantly be aboriginal people but if we look at the housing situation overall were finding that people who are moving to alice springs for work they might be families they might be individuals cannot get into the private rental market
3978112 in terms of market share weve seen the local manufacturers go from a position perhaps five years ago where they were more than 30 per cent of domestic sales down to less than 20 per cent now
3978113 that is a lot of taxpayers money and were not necessarily getting the product that the taxpayer as the consumer actually wants as a consequence of that expenditure of public money
3978114 if it comes to a bidding war with a cheque book we cannot match victoria in that record regard
3978115 the recent collapse of the doha negotiations is a factor that cant be ignored in that regard and its something the government will have to take into account when it looks at what the future direction of tariffs should be
3978116 reduced tariffs lower the cost of motor vehicles and thats good for the consumers and good for motorists generally
3978117 they are genuinely interested in helping the industry in what is a very challenging time
3978118 it is a major exporter it is a major source of research and development its strategically vital for the rest of manufacturing
3978119 it provides the skills formation base for so many other industries from plastics to aerospace this is a critically important industry to the future of this country
3978120 worrying signs on the horizon if you like and we just think that that would be to the detriment of motorists in this country
3978121 taking the tariffs down preferably reducing them completely would not only lower price of vehicles to consumers in this country but would also broaden the range of vehicles that are available
3978122 i think its quite obvious that around the time of these kinds of inquiries they pull all stops out to get as much advantage as they can
3978123 most of the benefits have flowed one way and that has been to thailand
3978124 i think we need to be a lot tougher in what we seek in terms of securing reciprocal gains from those sorts of agreements
3978125 serious about ensuring that there is a strong future for the australian car industry as a green car industry
3978126 toyota must have been a little wide eyed in japan when they got all that money to do a car they were going to do anyway
3978127 i think sometimes the government gets a bit more carried away than the car company

3978133 why would i want to hold him back women dig him and he is a wild man i am proud of him for having the courage to do something that seems so out there and is so completely unapologetic to be the first mainstream celebrity to do porn and use his real name that is truly hardcore thats what my man is all about you go baby
3978134 what can i say im living the dream i am constantly blown away by a society that says that sex is bad but violence is just fine we have war on tv all day long but if someone slips a nipple it becomes a national crisis its so backwards

3978147 so long as we do not have political stability we cant tackle both these issues properly political stability can be achieved through an approach of reconciliation as opposed to an approach of confrontation
3978148 i request all elements that they should adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can confront problems like the worsening economy extremism and terrorism on a strong footing this is the need of the hour we must sink our differences and adopt the slogan of pakistan first and move forward
3978149 there is no doubt that every pakistani is with his kashmiri brothers and sisters at this juncture i have no doubt that kashmir is the heartbeat of every pakistani and i have no doubt that kashmir runs in the blood of pakistan
3978150 enemies and some elements both external and internal want to destabilise and weaken us
3978151 i believe there could be some conspiracy external or internal against our state institutions we have to stand up as a nation and prove as in 1947 that pakistan will remain united we must show this to the world
3978152 if both are there the nation gets stronger our military army navy and air force is intact and will always defend the country the people and military are one if the army has the back up of the people the oneness of the nation will be at the forefront
3978153 we can confront these menaces when the people are with the military
3978154 hitting at pakistans foundations and spoiling the image of islam
3978155 pakistans enemies have always thought that it will not remain united but the people have proved our enemies wrong pakistan has prospered and progressed
3978156 in case he fails to get the vote of confidence the assembly urges parliament to give notice of impeachment in accordance with article 47 of the constitution
3978157 in the history of the sindh assembly which has to its credit approval of the pakistan resolution before all other assemblies today is another historic day as the resolution moved in the house will go a long way to save and consolidate the country by stabilising democracy
3978158 today is a historic day when we have an opportunity to get rid of a tyrant ruler and liberate ourselves from repressive rule
3978159 the day is also historic because an impeachment resolution is being passed for the first time against a dictator and the people of sindh should identify those who join the democratic forces and those siding with the dictator
3978160 the voice being raised today in this august house against gen musharraf is the voice of the people of sindh and pakistan
3978161 notwithstanding the sindh assemblys objection to the validity or legality of the elections held in october 2007 for the office of the president the assembly is of the view that gen retd pervez musharraf is unfit to hold the office of the president by virtue of being guilty of violating the constitution and of gross misconduct on the grounds that i he subverted the constitution of islamic republic of pakistan twice by holding it in abeyance ii he has violated and undermined the constitution and derailed the transition to democracy iii in terms of article 41 1 of the constitution the office of the president represents the unity of the republic but he has violated the same and caused promotion of inter provincial tension and a deepened sense of deprivation and denied provincial autonomy thus leading to weakening the federation iv
3978162 it was a great performance we were enjoying our game
3978163 these victories really build our confidence we were sharp today and hope to continue the momentum
3978164 he is good but today we really played very well
3978165 it was pretty late when we learnt that our match is to be played at 4 pm we were told about it only at around 10 in the morning it is difficult to play a match at such short notice we need to get ourselves mentally prepared and need to plan but then we have won so its ok
3978166 we are professionals we dont need to hang around together to play better on court we lead different lives mahesh has got his ways i have mine what matters is most what we do on court

3978168 some of them doing their task in very tough conditions and the misbehaviour of just one peacekeeper may tarnish their image and all their work
3978169 we are doing our very best to implement zero tolerance i can tell you that there is much progress on that now the mindset of all the peacekeepers in regard to the issue of zero tolerance is very clear
3978170 they know that all fraternisation all sexual relations are forbidden but unfortunately there are still some of them who are misbehaving
3978171 adelmo alvarado edgar juarez francisco torres and angel hernandez are amazing kids who succeeded despite the odds
3978172 their victory at the mesa competition shows if you work hard enough and believe in yourself you will succeed congratulations to them their parents their adviser david sackrison and the mesa program for their inspirational work
3978173 the mendota students earned the right to represent california in the competition by besting numerous other teams in rigorous preliminary regional and statewide contests
3978174 they had worked on their project since november putting in more than 200 hours of personal time to test and refine their trebuchet
3978175 the mesa program is a shining example of how schools from primary to postsecondary can form partnerships to work toward closing the achievement gap and prepare students for more challenging jobs of the future so they can complete on a global basis
3978176 the updated science framework will be a tool for expanding implementation of the science content standards for california public schools and making connections between the learning of science and fundamental skills of reading writing and mathematics to support student achievement this will also be an opportunity to incorporate environmental principles and concepts in the framework the publics input in this matter is vital to ensure the state provides students the education they need to compete in a more global economy that requires a firm foundation in science education

3978178 the particular item in my mouth is quite delicious and if there is more id like some
3978179 please be quiet this is quite important to me and your constant chatter is impairing my enjoyment of the other more harmonious sounds in our environment
3978180 a non human creature has come into my field of vision
3978181 any team would have broken after the first goal the linesman clearly signalled for offside and then the referee changed his mind the referees are to blame
3978182 it was difficult for the players to comeback from that situation and by the time they did we were three goals down
3978183 it shut down our incoming gate the trucks were being diverted either turned around totally or theyre queuing up on the side and waiting for the gate to reopen
3978184 this is one of those events that on appearance to us today is very very unique very isolated and i think in large part driven by what we believe was just wind sheer
3978185 theyre always secure because when theyre not working the brakes are in place so theyre always secured on the dock and theyre supposed to withstand a very high wind tolerance
3978186 i would liken it to a locomotive train it is on rail and it has steel wheels just like you would see on a train car and thats how it move up and down the dock
3978187 weather related event its just kind of like a lot of things coming together as almost the perfect storm
3978188 pharmacists are trained to look for things that dont add up and when they see things that are irregular its their duty to contact law enforcement
3978189 these drugs were able to be obtained by these employees because they were trusted employees who had access to prescription tablets they called in prescriptions to pharmacies and then had the prescription drugs picked up at a later time
3978190 they are given a lot of trust and a lot of latitude and its pretty devastating to everyone involved when they find out that trust has been violated
3978191 were seeing our seizures of pharmaceuticals and prescribed medications on the rise as a drug of choice
3978192 it isnt often that you can cram a whole years vitamin c into five days
3978193 this cake was given to me some years ago by a friend dotty jekielek of punxsutawney i dont know its origin but it is oh so delicious
3978194 my orange blossom cake is from an ann pillsbury specialty cakes cookbook
3978195 it takes all of your team and disperses you in different directions its consistent too it starts early in the morning and goes late
3978196 coach giemont and i both take a look at the menus for nutritional adequacy yes but also for performance what is being served is something that is going to serve these players well when theyre out there for practice
3978197 when its 120 degrees at 4 in the afternoon on the field and they come in theyre really not all that hungry
3978198 their intake has to be spread throughout the day its not as much about eating huge quantities at one time as about eating frequently throughout the day
3978199 not only do they sweat a lot but sodium losses in two hours of football practice can be 8 000 milligrams a day
3978200 every year the rookies come in and theyre a little more savvy because theyve been working with sports dietitians in college
3978201 they eat more chicken and fish theyre eating a lot more turkey burgers than beef they eat more smoked turkey
3978202 theyre not big dessert eaters the desserts are all the way in the back so theyre a little hard to get to but they really dont prefer it
3978203 we have some guys that are trying to lose some weight we have some guys who are trying to put on some weight keeping weight on we have guys who are dealing with health issues
3978204 my other hook is career extension if you take care of your body you might be able to play longer
3978205 my house is gone i have no place to live now
3978206 we were just at the door me and my brother and a big puff of wind came by us and blew back in the trailer about 5 feet back into the trailer
3978207 i love the flavor and i wanted to add a root beer float to the summer dessert menu
3978208 none of the commercially made root beers that i tried were a good match for my homemade vanilla bean ice cream when i tasted ibc root beer the cool taste of wintergreen was too prominent other brands were too sweet or had assertive flavors that werent quite right either i wanted a root beer with a warm naturally sweet flavor finally i decided to make my own
3978209 first i make sort of a tea from the ingredients with birch and sassafras the top flavor notes then i strain the tea through cheesecloth most root beers are carbonated but i wanted to try using yeast i add a natural champagne yeast that goes dormant in the cooler so it doesnt produce alcohol i also add sweeteners preferring cane sugar brown sugar and molasses i let the mixture brew for a couple of hours then bottle and cap it in 16 ounce portions which is just enough for two servings i make only a gallon at a time so that the root beer is always fresh when one batch is opened there is always a second gallon brewing
3978210 i want the guests to wish there was just one more sip one more spoonful
3978211 we concentrated on seeking out old fashioned candy we carry mary janes bit o honey vanilla tootsie rolls chocolate necco wafers zagnut bars and hundreds more old time candies but the last tenant in this space was a florist and since the coolers were already here we brought in over 150 brands of pop
3978212 i prefer sparkys because i grew up on it your preference says a lot about your sweet tooth i dont sell a amp w although you can get it at the giant eagle funny thing though i havent seen hires root beer for years and hes the guy who started the modern era of commercial root beers
3978213 thats one of the worst types of bank robberies there is this type where they come in and something can go wrong real quick
3978214 first coast community bank got robbed and its right down at the end of street and then i was like wow then i found out theyre the ones that done it thats completely shocking
3978215 it was unbelievable to see them pull a bagful of cash out of my car they hid the money in some sort of diaper bag or something to think people would use something like a diaper bag to hide malicious activity like that and to use youre neighbors as a mode of transport its really disturbing
3978216 the suspect lost it he grabbed the dog and squeezed the life out of it literally
3978217 he literally just crushed the life out of the little puppy
3978218 animal cruelty is a serious offense up to the point where its a third degree felony he could really spend sometime in jail
3978219 but wait a minute i love to go swimming and snorkeling and im a certified
3978220 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3978221 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3978222 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3978223 what one can say is that for people with chronic stable coronary disease pci can be deferred
3978224 they can continue on medication aimed at their specific risk factors hypertension lipid disorders diabetes and should be encouraged to have a good lifestyle with exercise smoking cessation and weight control
3978225 if people say my pain is so bad i cant function that is one thing
3978226 if people say i have angina but im doing ok thats another
3978227 pci adds about 10 000 without any significant gain in years of survival or quality of life
3978228 but when a doctor talks to a patient the doctor is an advocate for that patient
3978229 paying the cost out of pocket gives one a different point of view
3978230 until that category is changed the effect of this study will be modest
3978231 we have justified angioplasty for years by saying it is of great benefit to patients
3978232 this study shows no survival benefit and shows that the benefit in regard to symptom relief is temporary medical therapy should be considered for all patients with stable angina unless they have severe pain when diagnosed
3978233 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3978234 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3978235 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3978236 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3978237 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3978238 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3978239 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3978240 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3978241 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3978242 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3978243 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3978244 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant officense and undermine respect for the law
3978245 the end result will hopefully be a place where she can come down and run basketball camps
3978246 shes a great articulate young lady and knows the game and played in the olympics
3978247 ill be real anxious to hear her giving her analysis
3978248 the experience and the friendships that i made thats what i miss
3978249 if anything not making this team and having to report it has made me hungrier and more focused to be playing
3978250 i just feel to round everything out i need my second gold medal
3978251 im sick of this guys i feel like right now emmett freshwater is our mayor
3978252 i think the real mayor of carnegie should be sitting at the council table not the pretend one
3978253 that left us in a quandary as to who the mayor should be
3978254 those two people who just left ms freshwater and councilman fred carini are holding you back
3978255 its a safer deal we can sleep better at night
3978256 a lot of innocent people will be hurt a lot of jobs will be lost and a lot of revenue and its going to be an eyesore
3978257 i think its going to be good for the region its up to the gaming board now to go through and vet all those issues and get it in writing
3978258 not intended to provide an open fair and objective public process but instead to speedily cover its tracks
3978259 this environment that has surrounded the change in ownership has given the distinct impression that this decision is a fait accompli especially given the behind the scenes lobbying by prominent elected officials
3978260 this is not an inside job of any sort people came to us because the project was in financial trouble we happened to have been vetted greg carlin and i and we happened to have the financial resources to get it going the equity thats desperately needed
3978261 taking tests buying books any preparation youre doing can make the process expensive but especially the college visits
3978262 dios m o ay dame a ayudar a este m dico que yo sea compatible que est completamente sana y pueda darle mi ri n
3978263 lo normal es que una persona pida que aparezca un donante compatible no es usual que una persona tenga un deseo tan intenso como el que yo tuve por donar un rgano en vida
3978264 no lo dej hablar le dije que era una bendici n muy grande para m lo que yo le iba a decir que yo estaba estudiando y estaba dispuesta a dejar los estudios le dije que mi pap mi mam y mi hermano ten an alta presi n y que mi mam era diab tica le dije que yo sab a que en cualquier momento cualquiera de ellos pod a necesitar uno de mis ri ones pero que en este momento el que lo necesitaba era l que si alguno de los m os lo necesitara que dios le proveer a
3978265 le dije doctor usted ha dado mucho por sus pacientes y todav a tiene m s que dar y ah mismo yo sent su dolor pero tambi n sent su alegr a sal llorando
3978266 nunca le pas la factura pero aqu est tu ri n nancy
3978267 as far as building goes this year has definitely been the slowest
3978268 were seeing the effects of the national housing market here
3978269 we havent seen the actual developments the housing plans move ahead very fast either everyones waiting to see what happens with the economy
3978270 i dont see an increase to get back to that late 1990s to early 2000s level
3978271 i think its going to level out to where its at now
3978272 we had our big boom here in the 90s commercially
3978273 in the past you would see 25 to 30 homes a year in each plan and theyre all probably doing 10 to 15 homes a year now
3978274 its giving us a chance to take a breath and make some plans for the future
3978275 we have a little bit more time now for everything
3978276 ways to effectively use the post office to help your business
3978277 you have private money going in to the arena so you have an additional set of eyes
3978278 the sea should make sure that somebody takes the lead on this and is responsible for the final approval if its design if its architectural if its engineering
3978279 there is no better feeling than stepping onto the podium wearing usa across your chest seeing the american flag raised and hearing the national anthem played
3978280 i can put myself in their shoes and feel the excitement all over again
3978281 the games are still very competitive across the board in all sports
3978282 being surrounded by the top athletes in the world is amazing
3978283 when youre at the olympics youre competing on the worlds largest stage
3978284 many people have never seen them before and they are excited to see one
3978285 basketball is a big part of my life and i love teaching the sport and bringing a team together
3978286 i enjoy giving young women some of the same opportunities and experiences that i had in basketball
3978287 i said this might be the one time in my life i get to wear a tux
3978288 i took my granddaughter lauren patton up to see that and these 20 something fellows are standing there
3978289 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
3978290 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
3978291 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
3978292 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
3978293 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
3978294 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
3978295 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it
3978296 we were nervous about her we didnt want her to start swimming
3978297 its hard to place an 8 year old dog so thats great
3978298 so far it has been a wonderful help and were just so grateful
3978299 i try to pick ones i think will react well to being passed around
3978300 but this is also a way to help us out
3978301 we need to get the word out that if city residents lose a dog or a cat they should come here right away
3978302 trucks roll in constantly and we get thousands of animals
3978303 the cane does it for you every time doesnt it
3978304 had full knowledge of the criminal activity and in fact participated with her sons in the sale of the oxycodone to undercover detectives
3978305 according to the law this doesnt rise to a crime
3978306 why dont you get your boyfriend to bite it off you
3978307 i bet your boyfriend would like to take that off
3978308 i can understand you dont want him to be a teacher
3978309 i thought about this on a thursday and on monday i was open for business
3978310 i hear people say dont throw that away take it to the shop
3978311 its not usually a problem because if we get a couch its gone the same day
3978312 the one thing we can never get enough of is dishes pots and pans bowls and glasses
3978313 has been a blessing i used to be on the street not homeless but out doing things i shouldnt i was never the kind of person who was used to dealing with people and this shop has helped me tolerate different types its been a big help to me
3978314 the no strings shop is the stuff all my grandkids have things from here id be lost without it
3978315 if she thought there was abuse it would be easy for us to tighten things up
3978316 this is a resident driven effort and the fact that we have a group of residents assisting other residents is a gem and a godsend for us
3978317 there are opportunities for resident owned businesses but i think for them its giving back something they do from the kindness of their hearts
3978318 people come from all over and they donate from all over
3978319 but i never had any dream about doing this it was just an idea that made sense
3978320 backcountry pennsylvania the lost world of the agrarian democracy of revolutionary america
3978321 this is a quiet place where i can do my exercises and not bother anybody and nobody bothers me
3978322 i dont know what i would do without it its all i do
3978323 i have contacted many members of the westmoreland county republican committee and there is overwhelming support for ms ward myself included
3978324 after much thought and consideration and many calls asking me to enter the partys nomination process to replace sen regola i have decided to do so
3978325 but this unexpected turn of events and outpouring of calls of encouragement from friends and strangers has led me to believe it is something that needed to be done
3978326 with great doubts about whether or not their interests are being represented in harrisburg
3978327 can the chairman let the department director answer the question
3978328 lack of civility we cannot insult women at the table to ask for a gender equity study
3978329 unfortunate that the president of council behaved like he did its not the first time in public or private
3978330 what we most hope will happen when city council gets together on monday is that everybody will have taken a deep breath and council and the mayors office can find a way to fund the study
3978331 it was most exciting to come through the locks and dam and see the discovery and our staff with their fresh new riverquest shirts and the yachts with friends and family cheering us on
3978332 we made a victory tour up the rivers a vision becoming a reality is very satisfying
3978333 making it a green boat added a million to the cost
3978334 i think the boat is symbolic of the transformation of pittsburgh and i hope the community embraces it and sees pittsburgh in a way the world sees it
3978335 when most people think about yo yos they think of an old duncan yo yo they had once
3978336 they dont ever think about tricks to the extent we do
3978337 andos performance was great but i dont know if it was the best ever
3978338 he does take his arms through a lot more loops he uses his body more than most people
3978339 we were all thinking where did this guy come from
3978340 mr cohen said adding that mr luo told him he came to the contest only to scope the competition so that he could have a better chance of winning in 2009
3978341 i dont really look up to them as much anymore
3978342 i dont know if it makes that big of a financial difference but it would be great for him
3978343 i dont consider myself very coordinated but im pretty good at yo yoing
3978344 its going to be a broadly participatory project engaging as many citizens as possible in envisioning the future of the region
3978345 its about developing shared goals for the region what we want to be and aspire to
3978346 what is the road map we aspire to and how will we get there
3978347 it could be education health culture the subject matter is much more open to what people say they want to do
3978348 theres no reason if we do it really well and the technology is available not to involve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands and involve them meaningfully in this process
3978349 the region isnt just pittsburgh or allegheny county or even southwestern pennsylvania its broader than that
3978350 we have a shared history economy culture pittsburgh is the capital of that broad region
3978351 sorry guys back home that i couldn t bring you home a medal but i gave it my all
3978352 my first first 50 metres i think i took too many strokes
3978353 i wanted to take 15 and i took 16 and i think that set me up to not finish well
3978354 it s the second fastest i ve ever been so i can t complain too much
3978355 tis strange but true for truth is always strange stranger than fiction
3978356 lord byron dont let the pretentious don juan quote fool you my blog title was more inspired by the
3978357 oh cmon just do whatever it is that you do so i could get out of here already
3978358 uh no that chicken is for my brother stay away
3978359 oh hes still recovering from surgery coz he got hernia
3978360 oh no isnt that contagious no wait im thinking of hepatitis whats hernia again
3978361 lol chase the hunter warrior warlock and druid around the pillars lol
3978362 a bit is however long it takes me to learn how to play a warlock so i can teach you
3978363 would not be in the best interest of the community
3978364 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3978365 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3978366 if what youre trying to do is micromanage and solve everything then you end up being a dilettante
3978367 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission
3978368 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict
3978369 trying to get as much rest and recovery in my system as possible tomorrow the 200 im is going to be a hard race and so is the 100 fly against ian crocker crocks been waiting around for this event so you know hes going to be ready to do something good
3978370 right now there is nobody that wants to win a gold medal at this meet more than katie hoff
3978371 the competition is tough in every race for me sometimes its not a good idea to swim so many events
3978372 its really important to focus on your main event not just try to win maybe five gold medals
3978373 i remember when matt biondi was supposed to win seven golds and he got a bronze in his first race and everyone asked are you disappointed
3978374 biondi said nah i just want to win a gold medal you kind of have to look at it like that
3978375 johnny cash at folsom prison the making of the masterpiece
3978376 as much as yesterday was my worst idol moment it was probably one of my favourites too the final performance was just like this is what i have accomplished and these are my buddies these are my friends and singing one last time with everyone was pretty cool
3978377 i had been worried yeah after the comments and going first on monday and it was a such good show afterward
3978378 she explained about the way in which ben mulroney announced this weeks bottom three
3978379 i think its a matter of putting our game face on this is our last time performing you know on this stage and its one last opportunity to prove this is what i can do you want to leave on a good note and as soon as it was over i started hugging people and broke down but youve just got to suck it up and get through the song and then you can cry
3978380 yup yeah i did have confidence that i could have gone all the way
3978381 it wasnt a problem yet maybe thats why i got booted early someone knew that i would lose my mind with all the guys
3978382 the last few weeks i went way out of my comfort zone and tried to push myself to do upbeat songs and stand and walk around and stuff at first i was probably going to stick to it and then i thought why not try and push myself and take some risks and do something else so im very glad that i stood out of my comfort zone
3978383 sometimes on tv it doesnt come across the way you want it to come across obviously monday it came across way different than i wanted it to and its one of those things obviously mistakes will happen and things will happen that you dont want them to and you just move on from it
3978384 jwg sbk 08 superbike world championship full rip skullptura reupload
3978385 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3978386 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3978387 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3978388 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3978389 im not surprised by this i expected something like this
3978390 just give them the names of the soros operatives in georgia
3978391 obamas behavior on this shows again that he is not what he represented himself to be his nomination would put the nation in grave danger he must be unmasked
3978392 she is in a very difficult situation under enormous pressure now the responsibility lies with the delegates
3978393 we can still choose who were going to support cant we were not a dictatorship yet if we were obama would already be president
3978394 he doesnt understand the american political tradition he is a product of foreign influences and personal defects the british side of this is clear
3978395 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3978396 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3978397 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3978398 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3978399 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3978400 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3978401 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3978402 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3978403 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3978404 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3978405 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3978406 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3978407 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3978408 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3978409 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3978410 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3978411 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3978412 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3978413 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3978414 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3978415 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3978416 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3978417 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3978418 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3978419 hard preaching produces soft hearts and soft preaching produces hard hearts
3978420 and then it is our place to give them more to explain
3978421 we live in a transcendent starved culture and a transcendent starved evangelicalism
3978422 contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints
3978423 lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast our demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name
3978424 i never knew you depart from me you workers of lawlessness
3978425 never trust anybody not even themselves even if you have to go like for sex at least they should use a condom because in this world you cant tell who has the virus now
3978426 things back home are not very good first and foremost the sex education program has been banned by twelve indian states so thats not a good thing because we are not getting adequate knowledge and information anymore secondly the legal framework in india is not very good when it comes to aids and young people we have laws that criminalize homosexuality we have laws that criminalize drug use
3978427 i am a peer educator in school and my role as a peer educator is i provide accurate information to my other students and it is accepted and i think that by going on and doing this will make a really big change

3978449 deep in the dense architectural reefs of midtown primary reds and yellows and the hot purples of gigantic moving advertising hoardings are turning the rain into something that might as well be liquid stained glass to rinse the lowlifes and the high rollers off the bustling streets and back into the bars the theaters the crack houses restaurants and clip joints as if the sky itself in some spontaneous creative frenzy has chosen to empty an ocean of raw printers ink on the gaudy just and unjust citizens of gotham alike

3978508 one of the best things terrorists could do is just build more fast food restaurants maybe add another pharmaceutical company have a couple more infomercials and encourage people to eat the way they eat now and everybodys gonna be dead in a hundred years they can just walk right in dont have to do a thing one quarter of what you eat keeps you alive and 3 quarters of what you eat keeps your doctor alive weights going up heart disease going up stroke going up were poisoning ourselves with highly processed nutrient depleted foods one of the major problems is what we do to the soil and the air and the water and everything we take in our food we for whatever reason decided were gonna spray everything with every kind of pesticide herbicide larvaecide fungicide we decided were going to genetically modify things we dont know anything about can we actually improve what is already been created and the answer is maybe but not the way weve been doing it if you wanna know whats wrong look down at the table its staring back at you think of it as chronic malnutrition because thats whats going on but if we think were gonna go to the doctor and get a pill for everything weve missed the whole point we have been taught our whole lives to be consumers to modern medicine which is pharmaceutical medicine good health makes a lot of sense but it doesnt make a lot of dollars now the drug industry has every right to make money no question about that at all the ethics i think need to be very closely watched what the pharmaceutical companies are doing may not necessarily be in the interest of our population you can be as sincere and you can be sincerely wrong approximately 106 000 americans die from pharmaceutical drugs each year and these are people who took the medication as directed there is a lot more turning to alternative because what is being done before it doesnt work there is no magic bullet but there is a lifestyle change that reverses serious chronic disease its cheap its simple its safe its effective the solutions are here theyve always been here every single person in the world every culture every language every person in the world knows it you are what you eat food does matter its a choice you dont have to be sick

3978510 im completely shocked i had no idea id do so well
3978511 but its not like i was studying all day every day
3978512 investing in centres of excellence is what we have done in the us and it is enormously important particularly in a country the size of ireland its small enough geographically to make it work ireland is well situated to really create exceptional outcomes for cancer patients
3978513 thats a problem we also have in the us lung cancers are both under reported and under appreciated
3978514 i knew at the end of the day i wouldnt get in trouble for a vicks inhaler the size of my small finger theres a lot worse cases of drugs than that
3978515 it was bad because my name probably will be associated with it drugs but thats not my worry if people want to think that they can think it
3978516 it was a pretty difficult time but from day one when it the positive test happened my coach was like youre going to beijing just train like youre going to beijing so it almost spurred me on to train harder than ever
3978517 obviously my mum and dad would have seen it a lot in having to speak to everyone but it was good for me that i was able to detach myself from it
3978518 just around the beginning of april everything started coming together again we moved into a new facility and i started recovering better after practices
3978519 im up there now with a lot of fast swimmers and i can only improve i feel ive only tapped into my potential
3978520 an australian coach said to me that 2 10 low would definitely make the final but that shows the standard out there
3978521 its been a very positive games for me especially after everything ive been through its just unfortunate they come around every four years but its good in terms of getting the name out there and being up in the ranks
3978522 it is prohibited in belarus to talk on contemporary issues of the world and particularly those of our own country
3978523 the only way for us to perform is to go underground free public space exists only underground in belarus

3978526 the virus is not that clever we can overcome but it works on our ignorance both political ignorance economic ignorance and personal ignorance
3978527 may sound frivolous but little else has proven effective for the men most affected by the epidemic
3978528 committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
3978529 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
3978530 a very easy population to fund its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
3978531 may increase their risk behaviors due to factors such as loneliness isolation separation from partners which can result in new partners drug use and inadequate access to health care
3978532 aggressively confronting the epidemic among latinos is one of cdcs highest hiv prevention priorities prevention efforts must be designed to reach a multi ethnic latino population
3978533 until they are very very sick and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
3978534 sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine
3978535 from there we can develop means to build trust and better communicate the value of medical treatment to hispanics with hiv and preventive methods for those at risk of contracting hiv
3978536 it is a crime for people with access to antiretrovirals to continue to die from tb
3978537 i gnoring tb screening and care undermines all the gains made in hiv treatment
3978538 it is tyranny of the police it is against every artiste instead of going after criminals the police are going after musicians
3978539 its an outdated law thats being dug up by immature and backward thinking bureaucrats and cops
3978540 there is no dance ban on discos they have to obtain a license and they can function
3978541 hey i look good now and people want to date me
3978542 obama is good friends with bill ayers therefore obama blew up the pentagon just like bill ayers

3978545 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
3978546 consistency in performance is probably the key to being successful
3978547 i think our team last year probably didnt play with a lot of consistency in performance we didnt finish games we didnt finish the season we probably played one complete game i think those two things finishing and consistency in performance are probably the two things that were the biggest focal points for us in the off season to try to improve on ive seen a tremendous improvement in our team in those areas in this off season
3978548 i think that decision making and judgment and accuracy are probably critical factors in being a successful quarterback
3978549 i certainly feel if you can minimize the number of thought processes that you have to go through before you make that decision it can be beneficial its something that he did more of in high school and i feel good about the way hes responded to that
3978550 i do think there is some opportunity for several people at the receiver position to sort of step up
3978551 some of those players are young players but we also have some players who have some experience but i think the development of that group is going to be really the key to our success offensively because we do have some returning players on the offensive line we dont have a lot of depth

3978555 sorry guys back home that i couldn t bring you home a medal but i gave it my all
3978556 my first first 50 metres i think i took too many strokes
3978557 i wanted to take 15 and i took 16 and i think that set me up to not finish well
3978558 it s the second fastest i ve ever been so i can t complain too much
3978559 i put all my shorts on youtube my distributors take them down now and then i love my distributors but i kinda think that shorts should be out there even if i have to pirate them myself
3978560 to edgar poe the eye like a strange balloon mounts toward infinity
3978561 were getting a strong picture that eight to nine hours sleep appears to be optimal
3978562 we found that getting less is certainly detrimental because the brain cells are simply not recharging enough to start the day again
3978563 and that could be removing the advantage of sleeping longer
3978564 it was a big surprise to us because napping is really associated with babies and older people
3978565 but clearly teenagers are doing it just about as much

3978580 its to bolster our economic competitiveness and indeed our economic survival after all no babies means no workers for the future right no workers means our economy will be affected
3978581 as long as we have a dynamic economy we can solve our problems
3978582 i work 15 hours a day and i still am not sure if i will be able to retire so why have kids just do what we can eventually die and thats it
3978583 why should i worry about the survival of the economy and what not when the government sees us as just workers for the monster life should be about more than just work work work

3978599 we think this hiring bonus will help meet our needs
3978600 we are doing promotions to get the word out we will take officers from other states if they have comparable experience
3978601 we are trying to get the word out about the hiring benefits within our department
3978602 it seemed like a few years ago that when you thought of veterans health care you were thinking i dont want to end up there
3978603 now people who are not veterans are wishing they could come here and be with you
3978604 when i came here they truly believed in delivering quality of care
3978605 but in some areas there were shortages of staff and we moved to correct that
3978606 veteran feedback told us that we needed to expand services
3978607 for those who have proven time and again that they simply will not follow the law
3978608 if the person wouldve stopped that night and helped my son i wouldve forgave him
3978609 we definitely want to be reasonable and we definitely want to work with d r horton toward an amicable compromise solution
3978610 d r horton inc previously stated that it would have the allens house inspected by a certified industrial hygienist and then offer to perform any work recommended by the hygienist we have done exactly that in short we have asked for a chance to repair the problem and we have even offered to allow the allens to approve the contractors that will be used nevertheless the allens have chosen to reject hortons offer and deny us the chance to help them get back into their home
3978611 it doesnt make sense financially and it doesnt make sense to disturb that area
3978612 its possible to put a road there but it would be expensive and difficult
3978613 it would cross our property and fill in part of our pond
3978614 the reason you pay road taxes and state taxes is for situations like this
3978615 we want convenience and access to get in and out what everybody wants
3978616 ive been in neighborhood meetings and talking with people in the street who are just disgusted
3978617 youll be in the mall having to walk behind these guys having to look at their underwear and its just not appropriate
3978618 what about that innocent child who grows up with a parent who wears saggy pants
3978619 the aclu and the naacp i didnt want to fight that battle at that time
3978620 i may still consider it now that jasper county has done it and charleston is thinking about it
3978621 i saw this on television last night and said what the devil is he doing
3978622 they tell me this is how they dress and if people dont want to see it they should close their eyes
3978623 its not going to be just targeting young black men
3978624 wed love to have somebody in custody right now i dont think were that far away this 10 000 reward may very well lead us to the final piece we need
3978625 while numerous arrests have been made during this time they are not directly associated with the homicide
3978626 we have made a lot of arrests but we have not arrested anyone connected with this particular incident
3978627 the phone has continued to ring people have continued to walk in
3978628 they want the people caught just like law enforcement does
3978629 they seem to be keen on trying to do something with these children
3978630 we are very happy to have them come on board we have had a lot of groups help us in the past but there seems to be something special about this group
3978631 this is what we thought would be a good starting point
3978632 we have to do a better job of showing the needs
3978633 its likely that there will be serious cutbacks to important programs and services
3978634 this is just the latest illustration of why we need comprehensive tax and funding reform and why we need it now
3978635 what were seeing now is turning out to be stranger than anyone could have forecast
3978636 whether you call it a recession or not this is unprecedented
3978637 i certainly think this is a feature the people of charleston should pay attention to
3978638 when they did the genetic work they determined that they were werent the same that they were in fact two different species
3978639 only if you have some sort of federal action does it come into play
3978640 as far as doing work like timbering or whatever normal activities people are doing on their lands its not likely to have much of an impact unless theres some sort of federal connection
3978641 i am fighting for my heritage and my rights as a southerner and an american

3978659 how could the city of roanoke issue a warrant on me when they knew my mother has filed several complaints against johnson had to force her out of my mothers house and answer other complaints against her for harassing phone calls i just dont understand
3978660 they have to swear that they are telling the truth and i make the determination whether or not to issue the warrant
3978661 now my name is in the paper again not once but twice for something i didnt even do ms holloway should have asked for id before she wrote a warrant for that 16 year old girl and this should have been investigated all she had to do was look back at all the complaints my mother has filed against johnson

3978707 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
3978708 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
3978709 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and economic causes is being constantly overturned
3978710 this also means the traditional sporting powers face stronger and stronger challengers
3978711 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3978712 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3978713 any time the wind picks up we will immediately try to start races
3978714 the sailing venue is known for light winds and heavy fog during the summer but there had been enough wind to complete all planned races from saturdays opening day through tuesday
3978715 we just rest up lie on our beds and try not to get too excited
3978716 we arent used to being fresh and ready to race really we are always at that certain level of fatigue especially being on the road its quite weird and the boredom is a bit of a problem
3978717 i just want to concentrate on the one thing i dont want to risk maybe riding the individual being tired for the team and coming away with two silvers or two bronzes we want to go away and win the gold
3978718 but things are definitely not as good as i thought it would be
3978719 i love the olympics i like any event where the chinese could win a gold medal
3978720 thats the nature of these sports venues nearly anywhere in the world
3978721 they are completely distinct walled off by parking lots and have almost nothing to do with their environments
3978722 i moved here because they turned my last house into a subway stop because of the olympics
3978723 there were thousands of people living there we all had to leave

3978744 com o mercado competitivo o acesso ao primeiro emprego ficou dif cil e o governo passou a ser uma boa op o para os jovens

3978757 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3978758 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3978759 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3978760 elsewhere on brand republic someone suggests that wpp is buying another research company because
3978761 weve been at bobbys for over a week and you havnt brought up dad once

3978768 i miss him and i feel guilty as hell and im not alright not at all but neither are you
3978769 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3978770 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3978771 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3978772 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3978773 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3978774 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3978775 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3978776 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3978777 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3978778 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3978779 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3978780 we hold these truths to be held self evident that all men are created equal

3978785 dan ahlul baitku aku ingatkan kalian kepada alloh tentang ahlul baitku aku ingatkan kalian kepada alloh tentang ahlul baitku aku ingatkan kalian kepada alloh tentang ahlul baitku
3978786 siapakah ahlul baitnya wahai zaid bukankah para istri beliau juga termasuk aglul baitnya
3978787 para istri beliau termasuk ahlul baitnya tetapi ahlul baitnya juga adalah siapa yang haram menerima sedekah sepeninggal beliau
3978788 mereka adalah keluarga ali keluarga jafar keluarga aqil dan keluarga abbas
3978789 sesungguhnya mereka menentangmu dalam hal isa dan ibunya mereka berkata apa yang kamu ketahui tentang isa dan ibunya jafar menjawab kami mengetahui seperti apa yang difirmankan alloh bahwa dia adalah roh alloh dan tanda tanda kebesaran nya yang dititipkan pada seorang gadis suci yang belum pernah disentuh oleh seorang lelaki pun mendengar itu raja najasyi lalu mengangkat tongkatnya dari tanah seraya berkata wahai penduduk habsyi para pendeta dan paderi apakah yang kalian inginkan ternyata mereka tidak berbuat jelek kepadaku aku bersaksi bahwa dia adalah utusan alloh dan dialah orang yang diberitahukan oleh isa di dalam kitab injil demi alloh seandainya aku bukan seorang raja maka aku akan datang kepadanya dan membawakan alas kakinya lalu membersihkannya raja najasyi lantas berkata tinggalah dan lakukan sesuka kalian raja itu lalu menyuruh untuk mengembalikan hadiah itu kepada mereka berdua
3978790 suatu ketika abdullah bin rabah datang kepada kami saat orang orang mengerumuninya
3978791 abu qotadah telah menceritakanb kepada kami bahwa rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam pernah mengutus beberapa pemimpin pasukan dan beliau bersabda
3978792 pasukan pun berangkat dengan berserah diri sepenuhnya kepada alloh setelah itu rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam naik mimbar dan menyuruh untuk mengumandangkan adzan untuk sholat berjamaah beliau kemudian bersabda
3978793 maukah kalian aku beritahukan tentang tentara kalian sesungguhnya mereka sedang menghadapi musuh zaid telah gugur dan mati syahid maka mintakan ampunan untuknya jafar kemudian mengambil bendera dan menyerang hingga dia juga terbunuh kemudian ibnu rawahah mengambil benderanya dan pada saat itu telapak kakinya terasa berat hingga dia gugur dan mati syahid setelah itu khalid mengambil benderanya dan pada saat itu dia bukan pemimpin pasukan tetapi dia sendiri yang mengangkat dirinya sebagai pemimpin
3978794 ya alloh dia adalah salah satu pedang dari pedang pedangmu maka tolonglah dia
3978795 berangkatlah kalian bantulah saudara saudara kalian dan jangan ada seorang pun yang tertinggal
3978796 ayahku yang telah merawatku menceritakan kepadaku dia berasal dari bani murrah bin auf dia berkata
3978797 dialah sahabat pertama yang melakukan penyembelihan dalam islam seraya berkata betapa indah dan dekatnya surga
3978798 kami semua kehilangan jafar pada saat perang mutah kami kemudian menemukan jasadnya dalam keadaan tertikam dan terhujam anak panah dalam jumlah kurang lebih 90 buah kita mendapati semua luka itu di bagian depan tubuhnya
3978799 rosululloh shollallohu alahi wa sallam masuk rumahku kemudian memanggil anak anak jafar aku melihatnya menciumi mereka sedangkan kedua matanya mengalirkan air mata maka aku berkata wahai rosululloh apakah engkau telah mendengar berita tentang jafar beliau menjawab
3978800 ketika jafar meninggal terlihat kesedihan di wajah nabi shollallohu alaihi wa sallam
3978801 dia pernah mendengar nabi shollallohu alaihi wa sallam berkata kepada jafar bentuk wajahmu serupa dengan wajahku dan akhlakmu juga serupa dengan akhlakku karena kamu berasal dariku dan termasuk keturunanku
3978802 jika ibnu umar mengucapkan salam kepada abdullah bin jafar maka dia berkata semoga keselamatan tetap atasmu wahai anak orang yang memiliki dua sayap
3978803 tidak ada seorang pun yang memakai alas kaki dan tidak seorang pun yang menaiki tunggangan setelah rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam yang lebih baik dari jafar bin abi thalib
3978804 kita menamakan jafar dengan abu al masakin ayahnya orang orang miskin suatu ketika kami datang ke rumahnya ternyata dia tidak mempunyai apa apa untuk disuguhkan kepada kami dia lalu mengeluarkan wadah bekas madu lalu disuguhkan kepada kami kami pun meraihnya dan menjilatinya
3978805 for who taught us to get pissed and for elaine who taught us to get pissed off in an orderly manner
3978806 di kota bashrah orang orang yang mengikuti hawa nafsu selera sangat banyak
3978807 saya pernah mendalami ilmu kalam sampai saya tergolong manusia langka dalam ilmu kalam
3978808 ada seorang lelaki mempunyai seorang isteri wanita sahaya lelaki itu ingin menalaknya dengan talak yang sesuai sunnah berapakah dia harus menalaknya
3978809 lelaki itu dapat menalaknya ketika isterinya dalam keadaan suci dari haid dan juga tidak dilakukan hubungan jima dengan satu kali talak saja kemudian isterinya dibiarkan sampai haid dua kali apabila isteri itu sudah suci lagi maka ia halal untuk dinikahi
3978810 saya tidak perlu lagi mempelajari ilmu kalam saya ambil sandalku dan pergi berguru kepada hammad
3978811 semoga allah melaknat amr bin ubaid karena telah merintis jalan untuk orang orang yang mempelajari ilmu kalam padahal ilmu ini tidak ada gunanya bagi mereka
3978812 apakah pendapat anda tentang masalah baru yang dibicarakan orang orang dalam ilmu kalam yaitu masalah sifat sifat dan jism
3978813 padahal setahu saya ayah tidak pernah berubah pendapat tidak pernah pula menyuruh sesuatu kemudian melarangnya
3978814 wahai ayahanda bukankah ayahanda pernah menyuruhku untuk mempelajari ilmu kalam
3978815 tetapi itu dahulu sekarang saya melarangmu jangan mempelajari ilmu kalam
3978816 wahai anakku mereka berdebat dalam ilmu kalam pada mulanya adalah bersatu pendapat dan agama mereka satu namun syaitan menggangu mereka sehingga mereka bermusuhan dan berbeda pendapat
3978817 jangan sekali kali kamu berbicara dengan orang orang awam dalam masalah ushuluddin dengan mengambil pendapat ilmu kalam karena mereka akan mengikuti kamu dan akan merepotkan kamu

3978819 think about him in all your ways and he will guide you on the right paths
3978820 kalau dibuka direvisi red bukan terjadi penguatan melainkan menumpulkan kewenangan kpk
3978821 so when power went out i just assumed it was a simple case of oh well here we go again
3978822 that turned out obviously not to be true and we had a much more serious problem
3978823 i know i virtually lived at command headquarters for many days
3978824 and it was very rewarding to see how people pulled together i mean people didnt point fingers or blame they just got on with solving the problem
3978825 the blackout brought everything together around the kind of indecision that was beginning to form about the eves government
3978826 i think the decline and the image was already there and this was just another piece of evidence for the public at least they interpreted it that way that he was not a good public manager
3978827 well if i knew the answer to all those questions i might still be there
3978828 quite seriously its hard to say i mean i dont think you can take one specific thing
3978829 i dont think that you can possibly rule out every eventuality but i think all of the objective analysis points to the province of ontario being involved in a pretty substantial renaissance of its electricity system
3978830 if you had a major transmission failure in the united states it would ricochet into ontario
3978831 as it is there isnt enough transmission right now to carry some of the proposed electricity to where its needed so is it likely to be imminent no could it happen again sure could
3978832 not only is premier dalton mcguintys government not prepared for the unexpected theyre not even preparing for the expected which is a shortage of energy going forward
3978833 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3978834 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours
3978835 would you be happy with that delay if it were your son
3978836 im advised that the two recent events are the first time the ready availability of medivacs has come into question
3978837 we will keep medivac capacity under review but defence is not yet convinced of any systemic problem that would justify a significant increase in australias contribution in afghanistan
3978838 we should not be accepting this we should make a noise about it to nato or provide our own solution
3978839 on your last visit to tarin kowt you are on record as saying to the two special forces soldiers as they lay wounded in their beds you can be sure that from your government you will get all the training and protection capability and kit you need to do your job effectively and as safely as possible did you really mean what you said or were you merely mouthing platitudes in front of soldiers who had risked their lives
3978840 hey can i get three of these picks up glossy yet cheap photos and can you make one out to david and one to josh for my uncle and brother
3978841 ive got my own website my people would be pissed
3978842 semua gagasan upaya dan jerih payah akan sia sia kalau sesudah pelatihan kita tidak berbuat apa apa
3978843 selamat datang di watu pinawetengan tempat leluhur kita beberapa abad lalu berkumpul bersama untuk menyatakan kesatuan tekad mereka sudah berembuk bersama untuk membagikan wilayah kediaman upacara adat dan pemakaian bahasa bagi setiap kelompok sub etnis di minahasa
3978844 apakah kita mau orang sulawesi utara dan budayanya juga akan terpecah sehingga kemudian akan hilang lenyap dari bumi nusantara
3978845 karenanya kita harus bangkitkan kembali masyarakat yang berjati diri lokal tetapi mempunyai wawasan global
3978846 saya optimis masyarakat bersama sama aparat keamanan di indonesia akan mendukung sepenuhnya iven ini sebab selain menguntungkan pemerintah masyarakat indonesia juga dipastikan akan mendapat keuntungan besar dari pelaksanaan woc ini
3978847 tamu tamu international akan lihat fasilitas kesehatan bertaraf international makanya akan dibangun rumah sakit bertaraf international
3978848 selama ini warga merasa tarif sopir taksi mahal dari bandara ke manado sebenarnya cukup 50 ribu saja bukan rp 75 000
3978849 kami sudah koordinasi dengan pihak phri travel makanya kami berharap ada pelaku usaha masuk sulut untuk mendukung woc
3978850 ini juga promosi gratis bagi sulut di mata international sehingga akan datang banyak orang sebagai wisatawan
3978851 kita jangan jadi tamu di daerah sendiri pariwisata bisa dijual dengan kearifan lokal yang menarik minat para turis mancanegara
3978852 kami akan mendesain produk produk kerajinan lokal untuk souvenir para wisatawan
3978853 jika pelayanan hotel dan restoran buruk maka akan berdampak kurang baik bagi sulawesi utara sebagai tuan rumah woc

3978877 our annual vacation will take place on the week of august 11
3978878 i am not sure which happened first that i jumped six feet in the air that i let out a piercing scream or that i wet my pants a little
3978879 the world does not live together as one in los angeles
3978880 this is the most exciting book ive read in a long time
3978881 its better to have loved traveled and lost come home than never to have loved at all
3978882 theres this toxic satellite falling to earth and the navys supposed to shoot it down but they cant the oceans too choppy
3978883 what are you saying the navy cant use an expensive onboard weapons system because the sea is too bumpy didnt the manufacturer gyro stabilize the thing i hope they get a refund
3978884 im telling you they cant hit a bus 150 miles away
3978885 ive been to sea ill call the navy department right away with a stand by swabbies you might not be ready for this i hope you can handle the news the ocean is bumpy you might want to take that into consideration when designing your ships and multi billion dollar weapons systems
3978886 maybe they can get the chinese to shoot it down for them
3978887 they did a good job on that japanese spy satellite a while back
3978888 having lost power shortly after it reached orbit in late 2006 the satellite is out of control the satellite would be expected to hit earth during the first week of march about half of the 5 000 pound spacecraft would be expected to survive its blazing descent through the atmosphere and would scatter debris over several hundred miles
3978889 something like 1 10 000 000 000 of the area under the orbit which means the hydrazine rationale just doesnt hold up literally not within orders of magnitude
3978890 several other hydrazine filled object have come crashing down to earth
3978891 simply a feel good cover story tossed to the media it is true that hydrazine is very toxic and could result injury or death but the odds of this happening are minuscule the average person in american is many thousands of times more likely to be killed in a car accident than by any falling debris in fact no one has ever been killed by space debris having the u s government spend millions of dollars to destroy a billion dollar failure to save zero lives is comedic gold
3978892 in the history of the space age there has not been a single human being who has been harmed by man made objects falling from space
3978893 is always looking for ways to pimp their systems and provide further justification that they work the upcoming change in administration is almost guaranteed to result in missile defense losing the top level advocacy that it has enjoyed for the last several years any additional missions and justifications that the missile defense community can provide would increase the likelihood of their systems and budgetary power surviving
3978894 while this shoot down is not a direct action against china it would be a clear signal that the u s can possess an active asat capability at any time if it so desires
3978895 the military has readied a three stage navy missile designated the sm 3 which has chalked up a high rate of success in a series of missile defense tests since 2002 in each case it targeted a short or medium range ballistic missile never a satellite a hurry up program to adapt the missile for this anti satellite mission was completed in a matter of weeks
3978896 all the pieces are in the right places so the engagement can occur
3978897 are always located within a range that makes it possible for their missiles to reach their target
3978898 we have a better than zero chance of successfully intercepting i believe an inbound warhead
3978899 this interceptor is really intended for missiles traveling at 3 to 4 kilometers per second the satellite theyre going to be shooting at has a speed of 7 to 8 kilometers per second
3978900 if it doesnt know what to look for it is unlikely to make an intercept and since the tests to date have all been highly scripted the system has not had any practice of on the fly if youll excuse the phrase intercept attempts blog wired com feb 15 08
3978901 i am very worried about the debris creation particularly the debris that the light weight interceptor will kick into higher orbits when it hits the massive bus sized satellite
3978902 cartwright said 50 would come down within two orbits with the rest coming down in weeks and months but those two orbits could be hairy and some of the debris will remain in orbit
3978903 satellite shoot down set intercept near hawaii debris cloud over canada
3978904 to my considerable surprise its on an ascending pass that will take the debris cloud across central canada a few minutes later then across a bit of western africa and eastern australia
3978905 the debris cloud would appear to steer clear of densely populated zones
3978906 the interception would occur in the earths shadow so optical tracking close to the event would not be possible and the next few orbital passes overfly significant population centres
3978907 they arent going to shoot it down what if this thing was an asteroid
3978908 why are we putting up with being ripped off seeing our children and their children and other families children being hurt and ripped off watching our direct kin the myriad wild lives of this planet wiped out and this unique gem of blue planet turned into a smoking wasteland by computerized robot people endlessly churning out imaginary digital bottom lines that even now are vanishing like dust in the winds of change
3978909 the high tech planes and ships commissioned for trillions of dollars to defeat an enemy with no navy air force or army and using 3 knives as its weapons arsenal were gifts to the military industrial complex that will go on giving for decades to come
3978910 right into the streets leading to washington a few million outraged americans hauling non responsive politicians out of their offices by the scruff of their necks and either handing them pink slips or charging them for their criminal acts ought to do that trick walking away does not mean ignoring whats coming down or how grossly were being conned it means ending our complicity in a stupidly stressful suicidal death wish masked by drugs denial and distracting simulations and rejoining the marvels of raw real exuberant life instead once more all together on the chorus why are we putting up with this were not portal power please dont misunderestimate my remarks i am not talking about electing obama next year after bush cheney have blown up iran and ignited armageddon cancelled the elections after another facilitated 9 11 or perpetrated some other dire mischief chances are the democrats are going to continue self destructing and we the non voting world are going to end up with
3978911 dude wes taking the day off and the day after that and the one after that you dig
3978912 im willing to believe anything if i can keep company with you
3978913 i never imagined what a monster i was creating inventing humans
3978914 dealing with so many requests would be impossible if i hadnt thought up the internet and email to keep people distracted
3978915 people who stay up every night staring at a monitor are too zoned to get it on
3978916 the demands keep piling up from people who squander the two greatest gifts i can bestow life itself and free will and still think i owe them personal round the clock attention you would not believe the abuse i get from so called religious people when i dont drop everything to fulfill some unearned whim or desire
3978917 most people think i live on a cloud in the sky and the rest are convinced i dont even exist
3978918 i remembered something about you occupying a mansion with many rooms
3978919 and i figured being god it must be pretty big so i started knocking on doors still i didnt expect to find you in d c
3978920 even though im bedeviled by rip off real estate hucksters it lets me keep a closer eye on the biggest liars thieves and terrorists how do you like my digs
3978921 well if you dont mind me saying it does seem somewhat ostentatious what with so many people going hungry and the rest wanting new cars
3978922 just the art on the walls must be worth gazillions
3978923 remember i might have to stay here until some fanatic finally triggers armageddon
3978924 especially after my son let on that im providing free accommodation to everyone who follows my most important commandment
3978925 and since most people are nice at least those who love all my children and arent totally hypnotized watching teevee or being owned by a lot of stuff
3978926 ive got to accommodate a lot of souls whats the rush to get here anyway havent people figured out that the pleasures of the flesh are exclusive to embodiment
3978927 the creatures i created the birds and flowers of the field the dolphins and whales in the sea the big cats in the jungle immerse themselves in each moment without worrying about how much cash they might be making by doing things that go against their nature
3978928 i never thought humans would take such a big bite out of the big apple
3978929 im expecting a big influx of arrivals once climate shift global famine war disease and 50 a gallon gas really kick in
3978930 and dont think housing so many souls is easy most people indulge such bizarre belief systems they end up here expecting something completely different and they usually express their disappointment at maximum volume
3978931 youd better warn everyone that the bedlam of all their complaining is about to see me impose an 11th commandment
3978932 what do so many selfish souls have to complain about after i gifted each one of them with the miracle of life itself
3978933 and the 70 virgins supposedly assigned to each successful suicide bomber if thats the right description
3978934 youve got to tell them to stop all that killing
3978935 suicide bombings gaining popularity among despairing and oppressed peoples everywhere who simply dont see any other way to stop an ignorant hyperpower and its proxies from killing their families and destroying their homes with the white house taken over by fundamentalists talking and acting exactly like the taliban they once funded a formerly democratic country armed with more weapons than all other nations combined is running amok and trashing the entire planet
3978936 now theyre even discriminating against women suicide bombers who dont seem to merit 70 blond surfer hunks for their misguided murders still for each so called male martyr im expected to pony up 70 houris otherwise if i withhold ill be accused of interfering in their destinies not to mention all the people who would still be alive if wannabe suicide bombers knew where theyre really going to end up if they push that plunger
3978937 just like all those american gis forced by stop loss to keep playing homemade bomb roulette way past their contract expirations most of my houris are on their fourth tour here
3978938 islamic law stipulates that on arriving in paradise on the wings of a green phoenix suicidemartyrs can look but not touch the 70 virgins initially assigned to feed them milk and honey and show them around so it isnt long before young men deprived at home start feeling teased here judging by their angry frustration id say most would be terrorists arent reading the fine print before blowing themselves to a kingdom not to come
3978939 as if anyone with a beating heart and a lick of sanity can really believe they will merit any kind of heavenly reward for murdering the innocent
3978940 and that goes for american terror bombers too usama and his followers
3978941 now american gis bomber and gunship pilots are showing up here after dying from return fire gulf war illness the sequel or most often suicide can you believe they all expect the red carpet treatment after murdering more than one million innocent kids moms dads and elders just to steal oil that was already being sold to them below opec prices not to mention defiling the paradisiacal planet i gave them by blowing their radioactive waste all over the globe and all in my nam e how twisted is that
3978942 all that violence on tv and in the movies those endless messages of fear and propaganda running 24 7 on the big networks not to mention all those anti depressants aspartame fluoride microwaves stds and cellphones frying whats left of their brain cells
3978943 do people really think ill accept their excuses for the mass murders carried out in places like early native america auschwitz stalins russia maos china l salvador chile vietnam chechnya kosovo afghanistan and iraq
3978944 do they think i put them on earth just to go to wal mart and get fat eating junk food watching the tube while innocent men women and children are being abducted and tortured in foreign gulags in their name
3978945 have you every tried carving 10 commandments in solid stone
3978946 what part of thou shalt not kill dont people understand
3978947 most folks who sign up to kill total strangers not much different from their own spouses and children who never threatened their country in any way are even dumber than their leaders who are at least smart enough to issue illegal orders while hiding far in the rear maybe we should change the branding how about simply kill not
3978948 you and your colleagues in the press and on the worldwide web have to get the word out that i dont care what flag people wave indiscriminate slaughter does not open any gates here tell anyone who thinks killing in my name is okay is in for a big surprise when they show up looking for a vacancy in my mansion of not that many rooms
3978949 he always asks them what about my strict word that children are never to be harmed
3978950 so what happens to the people who blow up civilians the pilots and artillery officers the tank crews and suicide bombers the quick on trigger sentries and all those who pay for this carnage without protest
3978951 isnt that a bit heavy condemning manipulated adolescents to everlasting damnation just for carrying out the lessons you put them on earth to learn
3978952 i dont like being slandered as a heavy just because some priest or mullah or minister or rabbi tells his herd i mean flock i mean followers that im a vengeful unforgiving bloodthirsty old sob if everyone found out how loving and compassionate i really am the whole manipulation through fear scam run by the major religions would end and people would start doing what my son instructed them to do in the only set of eyewitness instructions he actually dictated
3978953 christs respect and affection for magdalene incurred the jealousy of the apostles until he told them that she alone among them actually understood his teaching
3978954 to avoid priests and similar intermediaries who are unnecessary and even an impediment to understanding and following his example
3978955 which was not his torture and crucifixion celebrated by so many cross eyed christians and at least one perverted anti semitic movie maker
3978956 nor even a cannibalistic re enactment of a last supper deliberately misrepresented to have excluded women jesus real message was his resurrection he was instructing us to resurrect our own souls by taking personal responsibility for seeking our own salvation
3978957 by being quiet and really listening to where you both speak directly to each one of us from within our hearts and then doing what we know is right
3978958 why not finally end the manipulation of the major religions peddling hellfire and blind obedience
3978959 that would negate free choice and interfere with peoples need to learn for themselves to practice right thoughts right speech and right action which are the only ways anyone ever gets in here
3978960 that when spreading love clothing the naked and feeding the hungry or maiming terrorizing traumatizing or blowing up any sacred being remember whatsoever you do unto one of my creatures you do unto me
3978961 but why send everyone who falls for such long practiced religious scams and patriotic cons straight to hell
3978962 i dont send anyone to hell i send the really bad sinners next door
3978963 cant you see that trying to run a universe solely as a male would be as unbalanced and unworkable as its proving on earth look around you dude do you think there might be a reason why most people on this planet are not male trying to accomplish anything without feminine perspective passion and engagement is as stupid as heading off toward jericho in a one wheel cart
3978964 after all yin yang is a celestial symbol you know and while useful as a discipline do you really think practicing eternal celibacy serves anyone but jealous priests
3978965 so what does she do with all the soldiers and suicide bombers you send her
3978966 why she forgives them of course just like i do
3978967 then she sends them back for one thousand lifetimes of learning and community service
3978968 given whats coming down earthside id say that these next few lifetimes are going to be plenty busy and not all that pleasant
3978969 so tell everyone you meet onboard what theyd better hurry up and figure out is an exceedingly rare sun orbiting spacecraft
3978970 the cables were cut to send a message dont do the bourse
3978971 to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of russia and its allies
3978972 military forces will be used including preventively the use of nuclear weapons
3978973 consider it necessary for everyone around the world community to clearly understand that
3978974 israel calls for shelter rooms to be set up in a bid to prepare the public for yet another war this time one of raining missiles
3978975 the next war will see a massive use of ballistic weapons against the whole of israeli territory
3978976 gulf shield 01 will involve more than 5 300 french emirate and qatari personnel operating a half dozen warships 40 aircraft and dozens of armored vehicles in war games targeting oil platforms off the coast of iran defensenews com
3978977 bush is convinced that if he doesnt confront iran then no one will he also believes that if he doesnt militarily defend the dollar then americas days as the worlds only superpower will soon be over online journal feb 6 08
3978978 we have no information on opening an oil exchange in the free economic zone on kish island
3978979 i dont know who has speculated that ive not talked about u s economy
3978980 for the last two months a number of sheiks and finance ministers have been publicly groaning about the falling dollar threatening to break from the so called
3978981 directly in loans property and commodity markets to offset rate cut
3978982 regional leaders now seem less bothered by the fact that inflation is trashing their economies and driving food labor energy and housing through the roof
3978983 they werent looking at the other end of things they werent thinking of the other events as they unfolded the message got across but not quite in the way they were hoping
3978984 they dont do the bourse its going to be something different
3978985 the oil bourse is a chip on the table in a big pile of chips
3978986 are we talking a single currency for the gulf region
3978987 theyre talking about making a hemisphere this really is the new world
3978988 taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back
3978989 common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate
3978990 is it a stumble or was it or was he was talking about sort of almost blurring that the the enemy of al qaeda and the enemy of the the shia trained iranians and sort of blurring them as one enemy
3978991 the the problem of course mccain has is that he cant you know he doesnt want to make it so that he he forgot it for a minute you know hes because of the age issue he cant ever look like hes having a senior moment
3978992 hes got enough of that in the bank at least with the media that he can get away with it i mean the irony to this is had either senator clinton or senator obama misspoke like that itd have been on a running loop and it would become a a big problem for a couple of days for them
3978993 i think its probably just a blip i think the overall impression of the trip was this is a man welcomed by knowledgeable of and comfortable with foreign leaders across a big part of the globe
3978994 when mccain makes a huge blunder on the one issue he tells america hes qualified to run on foreign policy the media shrugs it off but if a democratic candidate had made the same mistake it would have been headlines for days lieberman would then have been booked on teevee 24 7 yelling into the cameras that they are incompetents on the very serious issue of foreign policy get used to this treatment from the media its sickening
3978995 i dont think the gaffe hurts him at all in the long run it was something that you know you can almost see anyone could make that mistake
3978996 hes very very knowledgeable john as you know in foreign policy
3978997 never mind that bear stearns was disposed of in a fire sale the dollar was collapsing job losses hit a five year low and the price of oil hit an all time high
3978998 proposed tasking any problems to a committee headed by alan greenspan whether hes alive or dead new york times mar 23 08
3978999 most americans cant even point to iraq on a map much less understand the difference between sunnis and shia
3979000 the office of the president should not be occupied by someone that falls on the low end of the bell curve of understanding for someone who has built his entire campaign around claiming to be the only one who understands the radical islamic threat it seriously detracts from your credibility when you dont understand the islamic threat hello media its your job to point that out
3979001 its bad enough that bush didnt understand the difference between sunni and shia before launching the invasion does mcsame really have to embrace all of bushs policies and complete willful ignorance too
3979002 christians united for israel until jesus comes again at which time most jews will be killed
3979003 this morning i had an extended breakfast with senator john mccain of arizona our topic of discussion was israel and his candidacy for the presidency of the united states of america senator mccains comments concerning israel are on target he gets it
3979004 running in essence on a religious war vs islam platform the other wilson remarks
3979005 undermine mccains argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists
3979006 the streets are very dangerous theres continuous exchange of fire in areas very close to my house
3979007 republicans can also count on the help of a political press that whatever its supposed tilt toward mr
3979008 as if to emulate dick cheney who arrived in baghdad a day behind him he embraced the vice presidents habit of manufacturing false links in the war on terror troubling as it is that he conflates shiite iran with sunni terrorists its even more bizarre that he doesnt acknowledge the identity of irans actual ally in iraq the american sponsored shiite government led by nuri al maliki
3979009 the problem here for mccain is that hes a dunderhead in statecraft devoid of self control capricious in moral standards and an imbecile in his lack of political judgment
3979010 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded
3979011 to seriously question whether mccain has the temperament and the political approach and skills we want in the next president of the united states
3979012 he jumped up and down screaming obscenities at us for at least 10 minutes he shook his fists as if he was going to slug us it was as violent as almost any domestic abuse altercation
3979013 what really scares me about mccain is not his environmental policies which are horrid but his violent irrational temper i think mccain is so unbalanced that if vladimir putin told him something he didnt like hed lose it start beating his chest about having his finger on the nuclear trigger who knows where it would stop to my mind mccains the most likely senator to start a nuclear war
3979014 mccain has already attempted political suicide on the campaign trail at least twice telling michigan voters the us would be in iraq for a hundred years that theyd never get their jobs back and that he didnt understand anything about the economy
3979015 the fact of the matter is that the u s owes the world
3979016 the u s superpower cannot even finance its own domestic operations much less its gratuitous wars except via the kindness of foreigners to lend it money that cannot be repaid
3979017 the cables were cut to send a message dont do the bourse
3979018 to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of russia and its allies
3979019 military forces will be used including preventively the use of nuclear weapons

3979036 the cumulative effect of clintons attacks on obamas qualifications combined with her campaigns efforts to turn many white voters against him as the black candidate has buoyed republican hopes for november by simultaneously marginalizing and dirtying up obama the clinton campaign also has tamped down the excitement of many democrats especially the young for a candidate that they see as offering a refreshing message of hope and change replacing obamas message of reform and reconciliation is a clinton message of resentment and victimization as voiced by former rep geraldine ferraro who claimed that clinton confronts sexist media bias as a woman while obama gets an easy ride because hes black
3979037 their tone deaf arrogant and insensitive reaction to the remarks of geraldine ferraro your own advisers are slowly killing your chances to become president
3979038 senator their words and your own are now slowly killing the chances for any democrat to become president
3979039 very critical of nafta and then we find out that your chief economic adviser has gone to a foreign government and basically done the old wink wink dont pay any attention this is just political rhetoric
3979040 as senator obama was telling one story to ohio his campaign was telling a very different story to canada
3979041 the core of the story turned out to be false the canadian government contacted senior economic adviser austin goolsbee to clarify obamas position on trade not the reverse goolsbee responded to canadian questions by clarifying that obama wasnt pushing to scrap nafta entirely but that the agreement needed labor and environmental safeguards basically what obama had been saying in public the steven harper government then leaked a completely fantastic version of the story to the press to help their republican allies across the border
3979042 their listeners and viewers to cross over and vote for her to keep the democrats bloodying each other up
3979043 want to prolong her bitter nomination battle with barack obama others believe she would be easier to beat than obama in the fall
3979044 i dont think mccain can beat obama if obama is the democratic choice
3979045 i do believe hillary can mobilize enough anti hillary clinton people to keep her out of office
3979046 im pretty much tired of the clintons and to see her squirm for three or four months with obama beating her up its great its wonderful
3979047 mccain ran away with the republican race and obama after posting 10 straight victories following super tuesday was poised to run away with the democratic nomination when republicans again swung into action
3979048 i want our party to win i want the democrats to lose
3979049 theyre in the midst of tearing themselves apart right now it is fascinating to watch and its all going to stop if hillary loses
3979050 i know its a difficult thing to do to vote for a clinton but it will sustain this soap opera and its something i think we need
3979051 both mccain and clinton were staunch supporters of the iraq war now nearing its fifth anniversary with no end in sight
3979052 both mccain and clinton also favor a hard line toward iran
3979053 in september 2007 clinton supported a senate resolution co sponsored by neoconservative sen

3979055 received revelations from demons and not from the true god
3979056 senator ted kennedy favors sen barack obama over two other colleagues he has worked with in the senate
3979057 there is the courage he showed when so many others were silent or simply went along from the beginning he opposed the war in iraq and let no one deny that truth
3979058 clinton has refused to repudiate her vote to authorize the war
3979059 even attacked obama for ruling out the use of nuclear weapons against osama bin laden
3979060 clintons key foreign policy advisers are drawn heavily from the ranks of the neoliberals who cheered as loudly for president bushs war as did the neoconservatives
3979061 richard holbrooke who exploited his experience and access to secret information during the clinton presidency to back bushs iraq invasion is a likely contender for secretary of state should she win
3979062 patrick kennedy said the most persuasive arguments for attacking iraq came from members of the clinton white house
3979063 is often described as the foreign policy expert closest to hillary
3979064 isnt it disturbing that sen clinton has received more money than any other candidate of either party from the big defense contractors why have the war profiteers given her twice the campaign contributions that they sent to mccain if not for the expectation that she is on their side of the taxpayer rip off that has seen the military budget rise to an all time high its for the same reason that the bankers wall street traders and other swindlers who produced our economic meltdown fund clinton

3979067 this constant drum beat of conflict is what strikes me which is not helpful and not useful i expect that there will be no war and that is what we ought to be working for we ought to try to do our utmost to create different conditions
3979068 in the offing another war is just not where we want to go
3979069 fallon was arguing in effect that it makes no sense to make the possibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy if merely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments without influencing the target of the threat
3979070 fallon quit in part over a new white house demand for an updated attack plan
3979071 says the vote will sweep the country closer to hard liners ideal of the islamic state
3979072 ahead of the vote the guardian council an unelected body of clerics and jurists disqualified around 1 700 candidates mostly reformists those barred from running were judged insufficiently loyal to islam or the revolution as a result reformists are not running in as many as 200 of the 290 races around the country
3979073 the combined events of the past several days the sudden ouster of the chief military opponent of an expanded war in the middle east and the apparent decline in the political fortunes of the most dovish candidate suggest that the bush cheney belligerent strategies may well outlast their terms of office
3979074 more than most americans trust or like her no matter how much she spends and no matter how many big name endorsements she gets her phoniness and arrogance prevail
3979075 the ultimate outcome has already been determined by the faceless fat cat plutocrats running and ruining our nation think big oil big insurance big pharma big business big law and lobbying firms and big wall street money they can pump in the money and endorsements to make clinton the winner and the corporate mainstream media will assist
3979076 rush limbaugh encouraged republicans to vote for hillary in texas and ohios primaries but in ohio voters who change parties must sign a form stating they are doing so because they believe in the political ideals of that party lying on that form is a criminal act and has now spawned an investigation that could lead to criminal charges against voters who switched parties for the march 4 presidential primary to help the democrats self destruct
3979077 crossovers went on the air to proudly proclaimed they did it for rush admitting to the networked nation that they had just broken the law using public airwaves to encourage people to break the law is also a no no
3979078 hillary clinton cannot win the democratic nomination for president the numbers tell the story even with robust victories in pennsylvania indiana west virginia and kentucky hillary will trail obama in popular votes and pledged delegates as they enter the convention hall in denver
3979079 so why does hillary persist because she hasnt abandoned her aspiration for the white house not in 2008 but for 2012
3979080 she will be 69 in 2016 hillary clinton is the prisoner of an unimpeachable mathematics so she makes the most of a remorseless situation by doing what the clintons do best commit political fratricide quite literally in this case by knocking off a brother
3979081 in order to realize her vaulting ambition hillary must mortally wound obama as candidate in the fall race against john mccain so that she can run against mccain in 2012 down in mark penns dark computer lab the data culled from pulse polls and focus groups probing the hidden prejudices in the psyche of white america are being packed like shrapnel into political landmines set for obama hes unpatriotic hes un christian hes a palestinian symp and yes hes black
3979082 exploitation of racial panic is second nature to the power couple ishmael reed calls ma and pa clinton
3979083 the fallout from ms clintons racially tinged blitz against obama will spread far and wide across her party like the toxic particles from a nuclear blast the clintons enrich themselves politically by looting the ruins of their own party
3979084 clinton believes she must destroy the party in order to save it for herself hillary could almost call it quits right now even before she claims pennsylvania as a scalp she has fatally toxified obama and almost certainly secured the white house for her good friend john mccain
3979085 looking for some development to shake confidence in mr obama
3979086 we know that the victim is not the only one kidnapped
3979087 this crime kidnaps all the victims loved ones everyone in their life all of society
3979088 we have two million reasons for him to be returned to us communicate with us
3979089 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
3979090 a momentum is built into this as a result of past immigration
3979091 in the 1970s 80s and 90s there were more hispanic immigrants than births this decade there are more births than immigrants almost regardless of what you assume about future immigration the country will be more hispanic and asian
3979092 whats happening now in terms of increasing diversity probably is unprecedented
3979093 within the conventional definition of race of white black asian minority vs non minority this is a big change
3979094 the way people report race 20 or 30 years from now may be very different
3979095 death and life are in the power of the tongue

3979097 he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the lord with steadfast purpose for he was a good man full of the holy spirit and of faith
3979098 are you a barnabas one who uses her words to lift amp to encourage
3979099 death and life are in the power of the tongue
3979100 our belief in tolerance and liberty our commitment to fairness fair play and civic duty
3979101 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
3979102 we are concerned that drink does play a part in a number of these situations
3979103 people from all the countries weve looked at have increased levels of alcohol use when theyre traveling abroad theyre treating every night like a friday or saturday night the reality unfortunately is that the levels of drunkenness among britons are higher and thats led to some of the alcohol related problems were familiar with

3979105 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment

3979107 sie sind chronisch krank f r den rest ihres lebens
3979108 umweltpatienten es ist die perfideste form von genozid betroffene die sich selbst nicht wehren k nnen sich selbst zu berlassen
3979109 die zukunft der medizin liegt nicht in der behandlung von krankheiten sondern im erkennen der ursachen von krankheiten
3979110 es mangelt der deutschen gesundheitspolitik nach wie vor an einer expliziten zielorientierung
3979111 keine definierten organisationsformen f r die vernetzten praxen die vielf ltigen und oft sehr unterschiedlichen aktivit ten seien eher als bewegung zu verstehen
3979112 nicht in der lage sei sein praktisches rztliches handeln an der einsicht in die rztlichen gegebenheiten auszurichten der kl ger sei durch wahn hnliche gewissheit seine wissenschaftlichen erkenntnisse seien unantastbar gepr gt
3979113 mittels der evidenzbasierten medizin l sst sich ein h herer qualit tsanspruch sicherstellen denn die wirksamkeit eines arzneimittels oder einer therapieform muss durch belege das hei t durch eine ausreichende evidenz in form von wissenschaftlichen untersuchungen nachgewiesen sein
3979114 ich werde einen teufel tun und ewald widersprechen der ewald hat sich ja alles ganz genau notiert
3979115 wow people actually smile here much as i used to remember people doing as a child
3979116 this is about counting each and every resident of the commonwealth period our livelihood on so many levels depends on immigrants and the 2010 census is going to make that incredibly clear
3979117 employment outlook is good especially when you consider undocumented workers do jobs americans wont do
3979118 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3979119 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3979120 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3979121 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3979122 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3979123 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3979124 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
3979125 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
3979126 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
3979127 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
3979128 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3979129 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
3979130 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
3979131 we all know the fact that the street is not a safe place to live particularly for the children different kinds of risks are prevalent on the street traffic accidents violence crime gang fights and demonstrations are very common further there are increasing number of crimes against children such as sexual abuse commercial sexual exploitation labour exploitation and use of children for criminal activities likewise exposure to drug use alcoholism and unsafe sexual activities have put their survival at risk
3979132 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3979133 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3979134 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3979135 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving
3979136 the financial results for this quarter were severe due to our rapidly changing business environment including exchange rate fluctuations such as the rise of the yen against the dollar and soaring raw material prices

3979141 han har i et r lovet sk rpede retningslinjer men de er ikke kommet endnu
3979142 de historier som kommer frem hele tiden giver os et d rligt image vi er nu n et til et punkt hvor vi m have en revurdering af skolernes arbejde med de internationale studerende
3979143 det er fornuftigt at tiltr kke internationale studerende men der skal v re en balance mellem hvor mange danske og hvor mange udenlandske studerende man optager godt halvdelen skal v re danske for at der er en sund balance
3979144 ive felt a huge improvement in my images in just the last month and thats worth 1 000 000 times what the workshop cost
3979145 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3979146 for those with home networks we think the hp ex475 or its less powerful and costly ex470 cousin make sense only for those with lots of pcs and devices to manage

3979156 it has been a good year and tonight is the culmination of a long period of preparations it was possible by the hard wok and desire to win by the boys and no doubt the support by the aiff the boys deserve to win
3979157 it was a good team effort there were also some good individual efforts it was one of those performances in which a determined group of players almost finished the game in the first 25 minutes against a strong opponent
3979158 i said there were good individual performances and chhetri was one of them he is a remarkable player and future star for india
3979159 he scored indias lone goal against myanmar in the semi final and another three today in the last 100 minutes he has scored four goals hat is fantastic
3979160 i want to thank the much maligned aiff for arranging the portugal tour which has been really important for the victory today we had also friendlies against malaysia and taipei before the tournament

3979284 were looking at the town center idea and asking how do we create the kind of communities at light rail stations that neighborhoods have identified in their plans
3979285 it gains more enemies to do station area planning without considering neighborhood plans the two are linked together
3979286 stay home have an iced tea or whatever and dont mow your lawn
3979287 its very likely almost certain that well be calling a smog watch
3979288 were thinking its very likely and we want people to start thinking about the activities they need to change
3979289 anybody with any kind of compromised lung health should be very cautious about exercising outdoors or doing anything strenuous outdoors
3979290 in fact anybody with healthy lungs should be careful about doing any kind of strenuous activity outside because ozone damages lung tissue
3979291 we are within a narrow margin of violating the new more protective standard
3979292 im not too worried about it from a business development perspective from a reputation perspective its going to be much worse
3979293 weve always had the reputation of being a clean green city it would be kind of embarrassing to have seattle become a nonattainment area
3979294 its a stigma even clean industry shies away from a nonattainment area
3979295 while the air quality issue doesnt pose any significant near term business issues for boeing we absolutely need to maintain the puget sound region as an attractive vibrant and competitive place for our employees to live and work
3979296 thats why we work closely with the puget sound clean air agency washington department of ecology regional transit agencies and many more
3979297 if we have that weather three days in a row thats typically when we get into trouble
3979298 were looking at the town center idea and asking how do we create the kind of communities at light rail stations that neighborhoods have identified in their plans
3979299 it gains more enemies to do station area planning without considering neighborhood plans the two are linked together

3979343 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3979344 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3979345 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3979346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3979347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3979348 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3979349 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3979350 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3979351 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3979352 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3979353 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3979354 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3979355 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3979356 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3979370 we are a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans

3979383 im definitely very excited about it it should be a good place to be for four years
3979384 furman is a big kid and he had a very good junior hockey season two years ago
3979385 he can shoot the puck extremely well he had a little drop off in production when he went back for another year of junior hockey but hes a kid that will come in and compete and work hard to be in the lineup he works extremely hard and has all the tools to be a good division i hockey player
3979386 hes very strong and has a strong shot he has the size and skill to contribute to a good program like robert morris
3979387 im happy hes playing d i hockey he gets to play in his hometown close to the community hes worked very hard to get here and im very happy for him
3979388 its good to see people from this area have success at higher levels and do it in the pittsburgh area
3979389 with a couple of us staying in pittsburgh it will definitely help the robert morris program gain popularity in the pittsburgh area make more kids take hockey seriously
3979390 i think having local people shows a commitment to youth hockey in the area gives local kids something to strive for to play at the next level
3979391 i think once you get one kid it kind of creates a pipeline having a very good local player helps in getting other very good local players
3979392 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3979393 in a statement yesterday the interior department declared that even if a federal action such as the permitting of a power plant would lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions the decision would not trigger a federal review because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears

3979397 vienen a os dif ciles esta generaci n se acaba
3979398 estamos ah los terceros o cuartos de europa pero nos ha faltado ese salto
3979399 todo se hace m s dif cil porque las grandes potencias siguen si ndolo y adem s una serie de pa ses como georgia y uzbekist n que antes no exist an han apostado fuerte por este deporte y ya est n sacando medallas
3979400 parece que sea un fracaso pero hemos demostrado que somos competitivos en estas citas es cierto tal vez nos falte una base m s amplia pero de hecho la lectura de lo que hicimos en los juegos de atenas es err nea disputamos tres combates por medalla y logramos cinco diplomas ol mpicos
3979401 yo dir a que el resultado de leire es muy bueno no excepcional porque eso hubiera significado ganar medalla aunque ha ganado a la campeona del mundo lo que s aseguro es que si david alarza no ha sacado medalla es porque se ha lesionado
3979402 esta generaci n se acaba y lo malo es que hay un salto muy grande scar pe as isabel fern ndez la propia leire o yo estamos por encima de los 30 a os me temo que viene una poca jodida para el yudo
3979403 en italia cuando destacas ya te proponen convertirte en carabiniere y permiten que te dediques por completo al deporte en francia las ayudas son enormes y adem s del gobierno los clubes tambi n pagan a los yudocas en espa a tienes que pagarte hasta la cuota del club donde te entrenas este deporte es muy duro llegas a casa dolorido tras los entrenamientos si no se incentiva a los j venes es imposible
3979404 para m ya era un sue o estar aqu y me he quedado a las puertas de hacer realidad el sue o de ganar una medalla
3979405 para ganar los 100 habr que hacer la carrera perfecta esto es si salgo bien no habr problemas
3979406 estoy harto desde el 1 de agosto me han hecho ya cuatro an lisis
3979407 se me puso la piel de gallina cuando vi a kobe bryant en el desfile inaugural
3979408 tanto que no desaprovech la oportunidad de ponerme a su lado para salir en las fotos pero luego me sorprend m s a n cuando me cruc con l en la villa ol mpica y me pregunt por mi lesi n sab a que hab a estado lesionado no me lo pod a creer inmediatamente mand un sms a mi madre para cont rselo
3979409 desde que estoy en china desde el 1 de agosto habr pasado ya cuatro controles de sangre y orina a este paso voy a llegar a la carrera sin sangre en el cuerpo
3979410 pero es l gico me someto por amor a mi deporte los controles forman parte de nuestras tareas diarias y son necesarios los campeones tenemos que ser limpios tenemos que poder demostrar que somos limpios
3979411 tienen que hacer miles de controles quieren hacer una campa a de limpieza pero es tan dif cil de aguantar
3979412 tiene el chico de oro un contrato con alguna marca de cuchillas de afeitar
3979413 no llegamos s lo a nadadores varones en ciudades de m s de 100 000 habitantes no phelps es una leyenda porque cuando llegan los juegos bate r cords es dif cil en cualquier caso medir qu impacto tiene
3979414 hace a os tuvimos como embajador a ian thorpe que era importante en todo el mundo pero sobre todo en australia phelps creo yo tendr un impacto m s grande y global si finalmente gana los ocho oros que busca en pek n
3979415 ciertamente ayudar a mantener motivado a phelps y a generar la atenci n de los medios
3979416 es duro casi hasta decir qu ha estado haciendo phelps los ltimos a os s lo s que lo ha estado haciendo muy bien que lo ha estado ganando todo pero ni siquiera s cu ntas carreras nada al a o la nataci n est entre los deportes m s famosos y los que en cierta manera s lo aparecen una vez cada cuatro a os
3979417 apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused
3979418 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3979419 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3979420 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3979421 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months
3979422 el jugador m s t cnico de la historia de este deporte
3979423 no los he visto pero en el pabell n tambi n estaban muchos amigos y ex compa eros para m estar aqu es volver a casa
3979424 por supuesto si jug ramos contra china la familia ir a con nosotras
3979425 no lo tenemos f cil pero lo vamos a intentar
3979426 es muy est pido para georgia comenzar una guerra con rusia porque nosotros somos muy grandes y ellos son muy peque os pero se es el camino que ha elegido georgia
3979427 las rusas deber an irse a casa son malas perdedoras
3979428 eres consciente de que la gente piensa que tienes menos de 16 a os edad que deben cumplir las gimnastas en 2008 para competir en los juegos
3979429 tengo 16 a os no me importa lo que digan
3979430 compru benlo con el comit ol mpico internacional coi y la federaci n internacional de gimnasia fig
3979431 no entiendo lo que est pasando tengo que sentarme y reagrupar porque siento que no s nada
3979432 te voy a decir lo que ocurre con phelps l asegura que es de este planeta es verdad pero viene del futuro su padre descubri la m quina del tiempo en el a o 2040 y lo mand al presente porque dentro de 30 a os ser un nadador vulgar
3979433 esa es la mejor explicaci n que me han dado
3979434 ahora que el tenis por fin ha sido aceptado por el comit ol mpico internacional es algo que deseo apoyar
3979435 cuando hablo con jugadores que no estuvieron en los juegos de 1996 y 2000 veo que algunos tienen remordimientos porque ven lo grande que son los juegos y lo importante que el tenis se ha convertido para ellos
3979436 espero que mi presencia y la de rafa s lo los hagan m s importantes para futuras generaciones es una de las razones por las que juego estar aqu es nico nunca querr a perderme unos juegos
3979437 probablemente tras los torneos del grand slam sea lo m s importante del a o
3979438 me siento feliz por estar aqu intento disfrutar con la experiencia estoy jugando muy cerca de mi mejor nivel aparte de por m estoy jugando por mi pa s y eso es tambi n una motivaci n extra
3979439 porque antes en nuestra mentalidad de tenistas no estaba ganar la medalla porque no se valoraba
3979440 en unos juegos est s por tu orgullo y el de tu pa s nadie viene por dinero eso es una tonter a son algo irrepetible por una vez compartes tu d a a d a con deportistas que sue an con lo mismo que t con triunfar el d a que gan la medalla fue muy estresante porque pens que igual no volv a a tener esa oportunidad y no volv a unos juegos la medalla es un ahora o nunca que luego marca la diferencia en tu carrera
3979441 es para estar contento no me voy a empezar a tirar de los pelos por haber terminado cuarto una contrarreloj como sta
3979442 y a un campe n le cuesta por definici n asimilar que hay veces en las que no se puede ganar por lo menos en caliente as que no creo que entienda ahora que cancellara le pueda sacar 2m en los dos descensos en 24 kil metros cuesta abajo despu s esta noche cuando repasemos los tiempos y analicemos la carrera comprender ver que era su tercera carrera en dos meses desde el giro ver que est camino de la vuelta y que a n le falta resistencia ver que es el nico escalador infiltrado ah arriba entre los culones ver que finalmente el recorrido no era tan duro como pensaba que la subida no era tan mala para los rodadores de potencia que el descenso s que ayudaba a los ciclistas de 80 kilos y ver tambi n que est en el buen camino que llegar muy bien a la vuelta
3979443 no era una subida para escaladores estaba claro era de fuerza
3979444 basta que ver el peso y el esqueleto de los que han quedado por delante
3979445 aqu no se queda nadie no se me ha perdido nada en este pa s
3979446 no he podido tener ni una casa ni un carro coche uno trabaja por un objetivo y despu s de tantos a os uno se da cuenta de que fue en vano
3979447 para un atleta de mi nivel es una vida muy dura muy sacrificada y sin que veas fruto alguno he estado 12 a os en el equipo nacional rindiendo al m ximo he visto a mi madre dos veces al a o siempre concentrada y no me ha compensado
3979448 esper bamos una huida masiva tal como pas con la selecci n de f tbol en el preol mpico en tampa se fueron siete jugadores y cuba debi jugar un partido con 10 que haya sido una sola atleta no est tan mal la verdad no esperaba eso precisamente de ella luchamos para que pudiera venir pero bueno le deseo que le vaya bien
3979449 y procur no enterarme de nada no quer a saber lo que hac an en la otra semifinal pero fue inevitable porque los altavoces anunciaron que bernard hab a mejorado mi marca
3979450 intent nadar un poco m s r pido que en los entrenamientos
3979451 lo importante no ser n los r cords sino las medallas
3979452 el resultado es manejable para el partido de vuelta podemos y debemos pasar la eliminatoria en nuestra casa el encuentro ser totalmente diferente
3979453 tuvimos la pelota pero fuimos incapaces de ir hacia adelante y adem s cuando parec a que encontr bamos el camino hacia la porter a rival nos marcaron el gol
3979454 tenemos que aprender pensar y ser inteligentes en la cancha
3979455 durante el primer tiempo no vimos la pelota y lo pasamos muy mal en la segunda parte en cambio nos recuperamos durante un rato pero con la expulsi n de antonio l pez poco pod amos hacer as que lo mejor era acabar 1 0
3979456 no me conformaba con la plata quer a el oro para sergio
3979457 en los ltimos 100 metros no ve a ni las paredes me gui contando brazadas
3979458 tuve miedo de que las gafas se me salieran al impulsarme demasiado
3979459 empec a tener problemas para ver la cosa se fue poniendo cada vez peor en los ltimos 100 metros no ve a ni las paredes me guiaba contando las brazadas los nadadores sabemos exactamente las brazadas que damos y as supe c mo hacer los virajes tuve miedo de impulsarme demasiado en las paredes porque pens que se me pod an salir las gafas del todo por eso me enoj tanto quer a nadar en un minuto y 51 segundos o menos
3979460 record que desde que era un ni o hab a so ado con participar en unos juegos pens que hab a pasado a ocupar un lugar junto a los atletas m s grandes de todos los tiempos fue un sentimiento grandioso inexplicable
3979461 es algo que siempre llevas contigo para siempre ser s un medallista la navidad y el cumplea os son cosas que ocurren s lo una vez al a o pero una medalla es permanente no envejece nunca
3979462 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
3979463 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
3979464 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games
3979465 even family members can disagree about how this should be administered
3979466 ive hiked for years on thousands of miles of trails and this was the first time ive ever been truly afraid
3979467 once you make the decision to squeeze the trigger and discharge a round you cant ever take that back
3979468 all i can say is that it never should have happened
3979469 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3979470 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3979471 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3979472 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3979473 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3979474 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3979475 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that
3979476 a lot of what keeps me going is knowing i dont have a family to take care of
3979477 my son is full grown and has a good job at oshkosh truck
3979478 ive cleaned houses for my two sisters friends done a couple contract jobs writing grant proposals
3979479 that sustained me for a few months but things are tough right now with nonprofits
3979480 hey baby grandpa built you a house so you wouldnt be homeless
3979481 its not always easy but i have to maintain a sense of humor about this
3979482 even when i wonder when ill get to a point when im going to break
3979483 the bench is against the catechism and the catechism against the bench
3979484 when youre in it you dont realize the extent of your accomplishment youre just practicing and playing but eventually you realize we were second best in the world
3979485 i didnt like the recruiting part ive always been a teacher at heart
3979486 but i do remember the relief of qualifying 10 days before the games i remember the depression of losing our first game to japan i remember our comeback against czechoslovakia that is still vivid
3979487 dare to be yourself everything is now wide open just go and get it
3979488 hes in and out of depression but thats expected he wants to be an independent person
3979489 we were planning to retire to florida our lives changed in an instant
3979490 with the continued influx of residents into the downtown area this business is more viable than ever
3979491 ross avenue east of central expressway is on the way to becoming a gateway to the new arts district
3979492 the woodards have known since 2005 that this day was going to come
3979493 they could move their business to a place that is legal and the customers would follow
3979494 these folks are pioneers in our city they are the folks who started our city i think we need to give them the opportunity to see this area develop
3979495 this reminds of the days when the banks were taking over properties during the depression
3979496 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3979497 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3979498 it was like the fiber optics of the last century
3979499 it was modeled on pullman chicago a suburb designed by george pullman for the george pullman sleeping car company
3979500 but roebling built a far more elaborate town than he had to
3979501 this was during the model tenement movement where social reformers had ideas about how housing could improve peoples lives
3979502 they believed if you gave outdoor spaces with trees and a park lives would be improved and employers would benefit from less absenteeism and more productivity
3979503 the roeblings took care of their employees and during the depression they reduced the number of hours so thered be enough work for everyone and they wouldnt have to lay anyone off
3979504 charles and washington were orchid aficionados and took personal interest in the planting of the village
3979505 there was benny the chicken man the milk man the bread man and the horse radish grinder
3979506 even though the factory closed in 1974 the houses were built so well that they continued to be wonderful places to live
3979507 all the cars and trucks were held up by wires
3979508 people all over the world revere their bridges theres something magical about suspension bridges old stone bridges have arches and theres a downward force supporting the load in suspension bridges the weight is collected by spans to the tops of the towers where gravity forces it down to the foundation and the earth but i didnt know all this when i was 5

3979590 there seem to be a particularly large crop of books about obama
3979591 what is he like as a family man how he is able to capture the audience and what is the rock star persona that he has been able to create
3979592 this young audience all of which had grown up essentially with one president all of a sudden was paying attention to politics and to the world in a way that i thought was galvanizing
3979593 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read
3979594 williams notes that if physical size is such an important consideration the current vice president shouldnt have been selected it should be pointed out that cheneys political career began in wyoming the least populous state in the nation with fewer than 525 000 residents its less than half the size of the richmond metro area
3979595 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3979596 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3979597 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas

3979605 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them

3979607 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
3979608 they want to attend to their farms and return to their normal life but land mines and unexploded munitions are posing a danger to civilians
3979609 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
3979610 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes

3979613 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3979614 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3979615 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3979616 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3979617 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3979618 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3979619 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3979620 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3979621 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3979622 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features
3979623 there was a tight security check there with many public security officers no one could pass the security check with a weapon

3979628 ironically while the seldom voters were the most likely to be mobilized by campaign communication they were the least likely to be contacted
3979629 those with the least active political pasts are the most likely to feel the positive effects of campaign communication

3979644 the state supreme court ruled recently that school districts in washington do not have to disclose names of teachers who have been accused of sexual misconduct against students if the allegations have not been substantiated yes public knowledge of the allegation could lead to the end of a teachers career even if it were proven to be false but were not talking about a witch hunt a few teachers being unjustly accused is far less important in the long run than the outing of a school district that hides evidence of patterns of misbehavior by teachers

3979646 more than 50 percent of the active female population contribute to the economy of their country
3979647 the problem is that this contribution is still mainly in the informal sector
3979648 the challenge cambodian women face is not just to access employment but decent better paying employment
3979649 positive trends towards greater equality include increasing girls enrolment in primary education and resulting rises in female literacy and expanded employment opportunities
3979650 if textiles goes youll have 300 000 people employed today on the road tomorrow not to mention supporting businesses large and small including mine that would also be in trouble
3979651 the attitude is very much let foreign businesses come and do it but no work has been done on paving the way and targeting what investment they want
3979652 to raise their participation in formal employment and decision making institutions women need skills and information about how markets and the law function
3979653 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
3979654 are you talking about the informal sector where women are already heavily represented or 8 am to 5 pm professional jobs
3979655 we are not going to increase womens participation in professional jobs until we have things like adequate child care facilities care for older people and salaries that keep up with the cost of living
3979656 in order to participate in economic activity and contribute to the economy you have to be healthy
3979657 the high rate of maternal mortality while declining is a real concern and a real challenge we need to look at why with all the aid we have received this has not decreased more in the past
3979658 this is also a cultural problem the woman is the last to get medical attention after the children and the father they are in bad shape by the time they come to the doctor
3979659 have improved at all levels of education the female share of enrolment drops at each higher level of education
3979660 the cambodian government is committed to increasing education opportunities for women at all levels from primary school to university during the next five year mandate
3979661 we have some vocational training centres now but not enough and they are not responding to demand this is important in the context of the garment industry which we not only want to stay in cambodia but to value add and not just use labour

3979758 het is v l te koud om zonder jas naar buiten te gaan
3979759 als je het warm krijgt kun je het ritsje in je hals een beetje verder opentrekken
3979760 onder de omstandigheden dat ik al twee en tachtig ben soms weet ik me geen raad meer maar dan kom j j

3979764 hoe zit mn haar en hoe zie ik er uit

3979774 the program should challenge the students to begin to understand cultures other than their own to think in new ways gain maturity and begin a life in which service to others is an important ingredient
3979775 it should also affect life here on the princeton campus as students who have this experience give serious thought to their academic and extracurricular priorities here
3979776 while it would be wonderful for students to treat people with malaria in third world countries it needs to be realized that these are 18 year olds just coming from high school
3979777 we wanted to explore types of community service that would be perhaps better suited to someone of that age this is why we largely discussed volunteering in hospitals or clinics schools or environmental or technological grass roots organizations
3979778 we want the program to be serious community service for the students and much attention will be given to this and to the benefits desired by the community members as well
3979779 there are currently rather few service opportunities abroad for young people
3979780 we hope our students will take this opportunity to get some deep knowledge of another culture by living in it working in it and learning of its often very different challenges
3979781 one of the most important points we wanted to underline was that the bridge year should not take away from any other community service a participant would want to engage in
3979782 there is no reason for bridge year participants not to participate in the numerous domestic community service opportunities available through community action pace or svc
3979783 would not be a matter of the usual academic grades and test scores

3979797 n deze schoenen zijn prima ik wil geen andere schoenen
3979798 hoe zit mn haar en hoe zie ik er uit
3979799 zullen we even in de huiskamer aan de tafel gaan zitten
3979800 nou als je het t ch niet weet dan blijf je daar maar zitten
3979801 de volgende keer neem ik een poederdoos voor je mee
3979802 wacht maar even ik ga even een vest halen uit je slaapkamer

3979805 grain is such a big part of the cost of raising livestock that many farmers big and small are losing money on every chicken steer and hog they sell this summer
3979806 by next year the supply of beef pork and poultry is expected to shrink by five pounds per person according to the livestock information center in denver
3979807 this is an nypd wish list and its not a security plan
3979808 based on that experience i think we have to not create another war zone
3979809 pagi mas christian ini sarah bisa bicara dengan mbak nurul
3979810 pagi mbak ini sarah mbak emmmm begini mbak maaf saya belum bisa mengumpulkan hari ini emmm soalnya masih ada yang kurang mbak
3979811 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call
3979812 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected
3979813 shes got a lot of people who worked incredibly hard for her who dedicated their lives to her mission her candidacy and who are very passionate about this
3979814 this is for hillary to get the respect her campaign merits
3979815 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter we set out to get a win and we did that we made it a little more interesting than we needed to but i thought his stuff was really good we scored early and we added on
3979816 like i always say you play nine innings and we did tonight
3979817 mendoza just didnt have it i was hoping that he could keep us in the ballgame but when you spot those guys those kind of runs last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up it was just one of those nights again
3979818 if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and then the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
3979819 but theres much more than just medals the rest of the world is moving i have a friend here from australia coaching a kid from another country and the money theyre giving him is unbelievable
3979820 im going to take a little time off to think it over
3979821 were building being a younger team the veterans helped out and talked to the kids to help them gain experience
3979822 you have to learn how to race and we have some bright stars coming up ryan cochrane in the 400 and 1 500 hes the next mike brown mathieu bois theres talent here
3979823 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3979824 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3979825 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3979826 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3979827 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3979828 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3979829 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3979830 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3979831 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3979832 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3979833 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3979834 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3979835 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3979836 the internet is not cannibalizing the audience for the nbc network
3979837 instead its actually fueling buzz and interest and driving people to nbcs primetime schedule
3979838 i just dont agree with holdbacks you cant really hold this stuff back any more
3979839 the 800 pound gorilla will remain network television digital viewing will double or triple but those gains will help the core franchise
3979840 if carbohydrate blockers were the magic bullet for achieving weight loss the epidemic of obesity would never have become the problem that it is today the ability to choose what foods move from your plate into mouth is the most powerful carbohydrate blocker and weight loss aid on the market every product touted as a weight loss miracle pales in comparison to our own ability to control food selection and intake amount
3979841 god it would be nice to beat the u s
3979842 if you play against teams that are maybe tactically naive who are in their infancy that will work for a period of time
3979843 theyre more possession oriented theyre more willing to pass the ball around and make us chase
3979844 theres such a huge rivalry between us were always so close but they always manage to win it most teams who play the u s a say we can beat them but again they keep winning
3979845 i had a few friends on the u s team say you almost had us we really could have won the game
3979846 este trabajo contar con sus 2 versiones cd y cd dvd

3979848 aahah i find a way to decrease the runtime from o logn to o loglogn by using a randomized
3979849 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3979850 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3979851 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3979852 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3979853 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3979854 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3979855 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3979856 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
3979857 he reinforces a basic message barack obama wants to send about a new non washington era
3979858 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly the right move
3979859 were getting a strong picture that eight to nine hours sleep appears to be optimal
3979860 we found that getting less is certainly detrimental because the brain cells are simply not recharging enough to start the day again
3979861 and that could be removing the advantage of sleeping longer
3979862 it was a big surprise to us because napping is really associated with babies and older people
3979863 but clearly teenagers are doing it just about as much
3979864 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
3979865 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3979866 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3979867 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3979868 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3979869 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
3979870 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
3979871 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
3979872 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
3979873 this man hes been talking absolutely rubbish he makes up stories
3979874 im not only going after him for the three articles im also going after the commentaries that have defamed me i will go after each one of the commentators
3979875 prefer to be the underdogs and take on the opposition like david going against goliath
3979876 i am not afraid of anwar i will be the giant killer this time
3979877 shepherdess kibutz lahav it is worth far more than 7500 but a lay off has caused a financial burden on our household no games here just a great deal on an historic piece of artwork
3979878 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
3979879 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
3979880 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
3979881 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
3979882 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
3979883 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were
3979884 me gusta el alcohol me gusta la noche y me gustan las chicas y me excita
3979885 lets put aside our doctrinal differences work together for the good of christ and to advance his kingdom
3979886 lets feed the hungry clothe the naked and help the poor
3979887 buddha points to the path and invites us to begin our journey to enlightenment i invite you to begin your journey to enlightened work
3979888 divine psychotherapy organically designed for each of us to empty out our unconscious as this false self is dismantled we come to see our true self the center of which so say proponents is god
3979889 i n centering prayer we go beyond thought and image beyond the senses and the rational mind to that center of our being where god is working a wonderful work just sitting there doing nothing not even thinking some worthwhile thoughts or making some good resolutions just being
3979890 deep within us all there is an amazing inner sanctuary of the soul a holy place a divine center
3979891 emergent doesnt have a position on absolute truth or on anything for that matter do you show up at a dinner party with your neighbors and ask whats this dinner partys position on absolute truth no you dont because its a non sensical question
3979892 we have neglected so many of the disciplines of the historical church e g desert fathers including weekly fasting practicing silence and lectio divina
3979893 when people discover we are a church with a yoga class they sometimes assume that were simply out to appeal to the cultural creatives and the neo hippies
3979894 the barbarian way was in some sense trying to create a volatile fuel to get people to step out and act
3979895 it is said of brother lawrence that when something had taken his mind away from loves presence he would receive a reminder from god that so moved his soul that he cried out singing and dancing violently like a mad man you will note that the reminders came from god and were not his own doing
3979896 the power of small groups is in their ability to develop the discipline to get people in phase with the christ consciousness and connected with one another
3979897 whos the man of peace in any village or it might be a woman of peace who has the most respect theyre open and theyre influential they dont have to be a christian in fact they could be a muslim but theyre open and theyre influential and you work with them to attack the five giants and thats going to bring the second reformation
3979898 1 choose a sacred word or phrase 2 consistently use the same word throughout the prayer 3 begin silently to repeat your sacred word or phrase
3979899 i stopped reading from the approved evangelical reading list and began to distance myself from the evangelical agenda i discovered new authors and new voices at the bookstore thomas merton henri nouwen and st teresa of avila the more i read the more intrigued i became contemplative spirituality seemed to open up a whole new way for me to understand and experience god i was deeply moved by works like the cloud of unknowing the dark night of the soul and the early writings of the desert fathers
3979900 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels
3979901 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros
3979902 toads of glory slugs of joy sang groin the dwarf as he trotted jovially down the path before a great dragon ate him because the author knew that this story was a train wreck after he typed the first few words
3979903 like a mechanic who forgets to wipe his hands on a shop rag and then goes home hugs his wife and gets a grease stain on her favorite sweater love touches you and marks you forever

3979908 everyone asks if we do digital comics since our name is digital manga i can finally say yes
3979909 all content available through emanga is streamed to your computer through adobe flash player
3979910 you can trade emanga points to rent titles for a limited amount of time
3979911 we are trying to get some of the people in the office to do voiceovers for a few of the titles
3979912 the kind of interconnect between parts of the system will allow the equivalent of two full length feature dvd movies to be moved around in the space of a second
3979913 every aspect of the system has been put together to be the most powerful and yet the most energy efficient
3979914 the entire value chain is built of steel steel begins to corrode the day it is cast
3979915 if the world wants to continue using energy its assets need to be rebuilt simple law of nature
3979916 the construction job will rival the combination of building the world war ii war machine the marshall plan rebuilding of europe and the post world war ii interstate highway system
3979917 if companies want to grow they can either find something that might take 10 years to develop or buy something
3979918 the relative compensation difference between somebody who is sitting on a derivatives desk and a guy who actually can diagnose and repair a locomotive has probably reached its millennial extreme but thats going to change i think well see the narrowing of all these spreads a process that started at the lows in 02

3979922 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3979923 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3979924 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3979925 i can assure you senator that christ would never advocate turning the other cheek to terrorists and americas enemies
3979926 if anyone votes for barack obama then they might just as well vote for the devil as he supports baby killing and the homosexual agenda two of the biggest sins in the bible
3979927 there is no fixed regulation to prepare this dish i hereby share my mums recipe to those who would like to have a try 2 mix the ingredients with the meat and preserve it in the fridge for around 4 5 hours

3979932 so now were just trying to get our fans to get a little bit more rambunctious into the game get a little more ruckus to help us win and have that home field advantage
3979933 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
3979934 weve never had to throw multiple people out of the stadium or hold court underneath the stadium or any of that stuff
3979935 the dome is an atrocious place to try and get people involved in the game
3979936 improvements need to be made to make it a more football fan friendly stadium not the place you go to be seen place it is now
3979937 on each third down play chiefs fans will all be standing and making as much noise as possible where in st louis many fans are reluctant to stand and be the 12th man on the field
3979938 we dont have a band we dont have a mascot we dont have anything weve got to start getting something around to excite our fans
3979939 i relate the drumline to being back in college where theyre making the noise and banging the drums and generating the excitement of defense
3979940 you just cant be sad when you hear a beat and you want to move
3979941 i just want to be myself to do what i can to help the team as derrick washington not tony temple
3979942 when chase daniel came in i didnt ask him to be brad smith youve got a job to do which is run the football team tony did his thing he was a great player but you do what you do
3979943 you see a guy who has a chance to be a dominant player
3979944 he hasnt done it yet hes an exceptional pass receiver so you can do a lot of things with him tony has good hands derrick has great hands that allows us to game plan a little differently
3979945 when you get the handoff thats the toughest part youve got to be patient and then once youre there stick it and turn it up a notch when you hit the hole
3979946 i saw him with the scout team all last year going up against the defense thats out there now this guys tough hes got great quickness is explosive and can change directions hes smart hes got a lot going for him depth wise thats huge for us
3979947 thats a big confidence boost moore said of his days with the scout team
3979948 you can go against the first team every day you feel more confident in what youre doing
3979949 they need to run the ball catch the ball out of the backfield and block if they do that well be fine
3979950 well get him on special teams now and sort out the rest as it goes
3979951 we like to think he would be able to get himself some playing time as he goes along
3979952 i sort of know how many strokes i take for the 50
3979953 i was hoping that i was going to be dead on and i was going to be able to hit the wall perfectly
3979954 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
3979955 he is just a normal person although he may be from a different planet
3979956 hes not from another planet hes from the future and his father sent him back in a time machine
3979957 sixty years from now hes only an average swimmer but hes sent him back here to mop up
3979958 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
3979959 your birthday happens every year christmas happens every year you only get to be an olympic gold medalist so many times
3979960 when my goggles did fill up there was nothing i could do
3979961 i couldnt take them off i couldnt fix them i couldnt get the water out i just had to swim
3979962 im ready to start playing again the 18 year old said
3979963 its been a little frustrating but its a complicated process the last thing i heard from my adviser was that the contract had been sent to the commissioners office once its approved theyll return it to me to sign and then i guess ill find out where the royals want me to report
3979964 i know tim wouldve liked to have this settled by now so would i but these things take time said tims mother valerie
3979965 the royals offered a contract both sides made some revisions and now were waiting to see what happens next at this point its a little like expecting a baby you expect it to happen but youre not quite sure when
3979966 ive had a good summer but im ready for that next step he said
3979967 carpenter was a big part of what youre going to do
3979968 you want to keep everybody as strong as you can keep them
3979969 recognizing it could be elbow or shoulder the diagnosis is better than that
3979970 missing a start is never good news but it could have been considerably worse
3979971 its the highlight of my career so far he said
3979972 there were 110 000 people mad at me for a couple of seconds i loved every second of it
3979973 uh oh for simplicitys sake is in sole possession of the job and he expects to become more of a focal point of the offense in 2008
3979974 in the spring we worked on a lot of things as far as route running and even more on my blocking he said
3979975 the coaches were hard on me and made me a lot better people saw in the spring how much more involved i was and how much they were looking for me
3979976 we have to expect big things out of him coach ron zook said
3979977 and im excited about the freshmen well use those guys as much as we can we have some guys we can get mismatches with
3979978 ive worked on things as far as footwork and blocking things fans dont really think about he said
3979979 but by watching film and learning coverages theres so much more to the game than people realize once i realized that and put more time into it i got more looks that i wanted
3979980 youve got to stick it out theres no guarantees how its going to go it might be stormy sometimes and you just have to keep playing
3979981 with this new offense when i first learned about it it was an exciting thing
3979982 so theres plenty of room for randy mcmichael and me and anthony becht and whoever else
3979983 theres a lot of things that need to be done at the tight end position and theres going to be more than one person doing them
3979984 hes playing through some aches and pains just like everybody but he made a couple of nice plays in the game
3979985 its not surprising i think reches a really good receiver
3979986 i have full intentions of being with the club within a few weeks
3979987 well see how my elbow feels i plan on pitching in september for the club if they need me if they want me
3979988 im a lot closer to normal as i have ever been through this whole process
3979989 im being realistic if i can help the team this season im going to this is the best ive felt
3979990 hes a max effort guy were excited by perez but we want to be careful
3979991 with everything that has happened this year its been pretty rough
3979992 would have been a nice way to get something good at the end here if i was supposed to go i would have went maybe it happened for a reason i still hope to end this year with something good
3979993 from that point there wasnt even an if at that point it was just a when scenario
3979994 ive done that in the past and it didnt work
3979995 im just going to give it hell and see what happens
3979996 the olympics if you look back its always weird results it usually doesnt take as much as youd think to win its people who handle that stuff the best that do well i think im at a point now that i know how big meets work
3979997 its a shame he would jeopardize a friendship for something that trivial
3979998 doubled up on them in victories i think they should be the ones worried
3979999 some guys have to get over there and have everything right perfect sleep and all that stuff
