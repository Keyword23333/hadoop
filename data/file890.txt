8900002 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground

8900005 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8900006 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8900007 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial

8900032 when he arrived at the hotel he was sent to the hotel next door it was apparent that his hotel had overbooked after one day he was asked to vacate the new hotel and move back to the original hotel it was now apparent the second hotel was now fully booked they offered him a room that was dirty and not suitable he refused he contacted me in england so that i could speak with the tour operator 2 hours later the tour operator called me to say the problem had been resolved and my husband was staying in his original hotel today my husband telephoned again he is still not happy with the accommodation the room is still dirty last evening he was getting ready to go out when he noticed the walls had recently been white washed and the white was all over his clothes
8900033 there is no excuse for overbooking clients this is a shabby practice and is reminscent of the bucket shop principles of the 1970s law makers when amending the package travel directive should outlaw this practice and create real sanctions for those in breach

8900072 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8900073 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8900074 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8900075 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger

8900077 size isnt going to be that much of a difference
8900078 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that

8900086 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8900087 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8900088 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8900089 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8900090 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8900091 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8900092 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8900093 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8900094 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8900095 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8900096 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8900097 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8900098 senator obama this is truly a good day for america

8900100 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8900101 i dont think any conclusion can be drawn from one weeks figure
8900102 imposing hefty penalty is not the only solution now we cannot raise it as it was recently slashed to 2 5 per cent from 8 per cent to converge spot and futures prices
8900103 apart from the penalty provision we are working on other alternatives to penalise defaulters
8900104 we are tightening the system to ensure healthy trading practises
8900105 we do not have any cases of defaults as all contracts are settled as per the contract terms stipulated in all contracts
8900106 in futures trading the exchange is a price discovery and risk hedging platform and not a delivery platform for compulsory delivery contracts
8900107 it must be stressed that the options listed in agreement with the trade unions are in the best long term interests of the factory
8900108 please let your administrator know which option you have chosen
8900109 we acknowledge that there are alternatives people can be given but we dont have recommendations
8900110 what we do have is an agreement covering 75 per cent of minimum earnings levels in exceptional circumstances like this
8900111 people are worried this is a smokescreen for more job cuts
8900112 both boilers involved have passed an inspection and production will resume at the weekend

8900115 other exhibitors engaged in the selling of agricultural equipment and vehicles will be placed around the fairground on open stands
8900116 this amount will more or less cover our expenses the biggest sponsors are the trade and industry ministry with n 50 000 standard bank with n 26 000 and first national bank which provided n 25 000
8900117 a highlight will be the signing of a five year sponsorship with meatco during the trade fair
8900118 since okakarara is in an rural area agriculture is important and so far about 150 head of cattle and small livestock will be exhibited
8900119 we however expect more last minute registrations so the number of animals might go beyond 200
8900120 we are busy de mining strips of land on both sides of the 101 kilometre road stretching from longa to cuito cuanavale and we do it manually
8900121 clearing both sides of the road means that actually 202 kilometres must be covered by our men with handheld mine detectors
8900122 by december this year we must finish the roadsides between longa and quito cuanavale the deadline is a bit tight but we will manage

8900227 i was rather disconcerted to see that the arrangements put in place for ramadan which we support for muslim colleagues have been imposed upon all councillors
8900228 we object to the request that non muslim councillors observe the fasting rules for ramadan this sends out the wrong message to our community
8900229 our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others
8900230 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshments until after the iftar refreshments are served
8900231 all thats being asked for is courtesy to be shown to the sensitivities around some councillors eating during council meetings whilst others in the room are fasting

8900303 erfreulich ist allerdings dass sich die anf ngerzahlen nach wie vor auf hohem niveau bewegen ungeachtet der umstellung auf die neuen studieng nge bleibt das physikstudium attraktiv
8900304 es ist noch zu fr h um sagen zu k nnen ob sich hier ein trend abzeichnet
8900305 fakt ist dass die neuen studieng nge h here anforderungen an die studierenden stellen deshalb ist es erfreulich dass die abbrecherquote bislang nicht zugenommen hat au erdem gilt weiterhin dass es nach dem klassischen vordiplom nur noch wenige studienabbrecher gibt
8900306 aufgrund der entwicklung der vordiplompr fungen gehen wir davon aus dass die absolventenzahlen im diplom studium weiter steigen werden und noch etwa drei jahre auf hohem niveau bleiben
8900307 danach werden diese zahlen jedoch schnell auf null zur ckgehen da die universit ten dann komplett auf bachelor masterstudieng nge umgestellt haben werden seitens der dpg und der kfp empfehlen wir an den bachelor unbedingt einen master anzuh ngen denn erst dieser abschluss entspricht dem hohen ausbildungsstandard des klassischen physik diploms und qualifiziert zum selbst ndigen wissenschaftlichen arbeiten

8900408 the russians gave the impression that their intention was to protect south ossetia and abkhazia from georgians but as you can see it really wasnt their purpose they wanted to establish control over these two regions and this is one of the first moves to show the world they are capable of doing so
8900409 my region telavi appx 1 hours north east of the capital tbilisi in terms of military operations hasnt been that affected but it was affected economically
8900410 this conflict is not just about these two regions it affects all of georgia one way or another for example the refugees are coming to stay in our areas and they need to be helped
8900411 ive been following this conflict on my own for some time now since 1990 when russia started to take control of these regions theyve been trying to provoke this into happening this was the first time the provocation actually had an effect
8900412 the secession was expected but the war was not before russians would drop a bomb here or there or fly a plane through georgian airspace in response the georgians would go the u n and try to deal with the situation diplomatically
8900413 this time the georgians responded with force they did military response to military response
8900414 ultimately i think russians have imperialistic ambitions in the region for centuries it has been a superpower it has gone from the ussr to being questioned especially by the u s and western countries it wanted to show the world it could do this
8900415 what is clear from the west and nato is that as soon as there is war or an encounter no one will lift a hand to help so if this happens to moldova and ukraine the west may not help
8900416 even if russia took over the capital no one will do anything because the u s is very stretched right now in any case these things shouldnt be solved with war
8900417 to me it seems that russia feels they have a need to demonstrate power to avoid situations like the chechen conflict it goes back to the mentality that allowing one area to secede will cause either an attack on them or for other regions to also seek independence
8900418 abkhazia and south ossetia are not always as they are being portrayed the media driven idea is that these two regions want to break away and be free like kosovo and tibet but the situation here is radically different
8900419 some russians take it personally when people say that russians are doing this because there is so much more than the media shows while i believe that russia is doing the wrong thing by bombing innocent people its really a decision that the government has made
8900420 this has nothing to do with the people of russia
8900421 most russian people dont agree at all they are mad at their government for killing innocent people
8900422 i think the citizens are suffering because of their leaders i think the future is really uncertain for georgia
8900423 according to the annual senior survey members of the class of 2008 slept with an average of just 2 75 people while at harvard 25 percent of students did not have sex at all and half of all undergrads had one sexual partner or less over the course of four years
8900424 the nih awards this grant to generate infrastructure growth through the support of several core services
8900425 the biggest part of this grant is used to support what is called the development core which refers to activities used to promote population research such as the awarding of seed grants to researchers and the organization of working groups on key subjects
8900426 is the administrative umbrella for the cpp the cornell institute for translational research on aging and the applied demographic program
8900427 my goal as director of the blcc has been to broaden the research mission of the center by supplementing historical interests in aging and child development with a new focus on health poverty and other related research subjects
8900428 we see the cpp specifically and the blcc generally as places to generate new synergies on campus among different departments and individuals interested in social science research places for researchers who might otherwise not meet to gather and engage in cooperative scholarship
8900429 our founders said any person any study and strengthening the field of population research at cornell will only make our school more attractive to future students
8900430 this grant is recognition of the work thats already been going on here
8900431 you have to begin with a core of researchers who have been successful at winning research grants
8900432 then add to that core the type of superstructure that can be developed through grants such as this one
8900433 this grant will give the cpp an opportunity to prove that it has what it takes to become a national and international leader in population research and also to secure additional funding from the nih in the future
8900434 you never know what can turn a team around whether its the introduction of a new freshman class or the introduction of new philosophies
8900435 its very difficult to predict i hope with a fresh start for the team maybe things will turn around
8900436 im trying to get a general feel for the talent level of the team and figure out where we stand with each position
8900437 figuring out the depth chart is an important thing to know i know the staff is very strong and i know weve got some guys on the offensive side who can really do some damage so im looking forward to seeing them play
8900438 those guys who i know have already been in to say hello
8900439 they know what to expect from me which helps on their side of things and i know what to expect from them which helps on my side of things i think theyve been able to communicate to the other players a little bit what im about
8900440 theres always a little nervousness with a new coach because you dont know what hes going to be like but i think in general that everybody is really excited
8900441 he is very energetic and enthusiastic you see that in a coach and makes you excited as a player
8900442 you notice a difference in the depth of talent on the teams
8900443 theres a much more national approach to recruiting here franklin amp marshall was a bit more regional but with cornell just the name recognition of the university itself allows me to recruit in places where there happen to be a lot more talented baseball players there comes a time when you get a little bit tired of losing out on recruits to division i schools now in this environment we can beat those other schools for recruits
8900444 weve got a meeting with the registrar and were going to work with them to keep cornell accurate
8900445 we havent come to any firm agreements but we are very very optimistic
8900446 we got a lot of e mails saying that even with the inaccuracies they just wanted schedulizer back
8900447 even with the inaccuracies its so much more convenient and for many departments we were still on the nose
8900448 we have a system for manual updates in place and were going to try to keep it as accurate as we can
8900449 if someone notices an error they can tell us and we can fix it we just dont have any way of automating it
8900450 we were just really overwhelmed and floored by the level of support we got from the cornell community
8900451 we are thankful and we are proud to serve the cornell community
8900452 this is supposedly one of the most democratic and advanced centers of science and knowledge in the world the fact that they would do something like this over something so small something so trivial without any kind of student consensus
8900453 he ingresado voluntariamente en un centro para el tratamiento de la adicci n al sexo
8900454 what they didnt tell you was that she didnt even need to go that second time for the u s to win the gold
8900455 hey at least it got her on the wheaties box
8900456 you didnt know anything about the other girls on the team youre going who is samantha peszek a member of the u s gymnastics team they focus too much on the best kids on the team i want to see the best athletes i dont care where theyre from i really dont care about all the interviews
8900457 as a gymnastics coach the fact that it seems to have just as much coverage as other sports is a plus the athletic clubs love it
8900458 i know gymnastics is the first event to sell out at the olympics
8900459 its been gauged the most popular in the summer olympics it helps college gymnastics im guessing in an olympic year our attendance numbers will go up
8900460 its one of those sports you look at because its really really amazing what theyre doing and making look so easy
8900461 its like watching an acrobat its like wow how can you not marvel at some of the things these people are doing every year it gets harder
8900462 i share the urgency and commitment to make progress with what is one of the major areas of concern for all of us in student life and safety dangerous binge drinking
8900463 i believe the amethyst initiatives statement raises serious policy issues on this important topic issues that should be debated and evaluated however based on my experience and my reading of the research literature i opted not to sign this statement
8900464 i share the presidents reluctance to sign on to the amethyst initiative it seems to me that one thing you cant escape is that changing the drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved lives
8900465 im all for the conversation and the discussion about how we can create an environment where alcohol is used sensibly but i think that starting with a reduction in the drinking age is perhaps the wrong place to begin
8900466 im not certain that changing the drinking age in any direction is going to lessen the problems at all
8900467 the drinking age is just one aspect of the many problems of alcohol
8900468 i dont know if theres enough support to make lowering the drinking age happen
8900469 anybody who wants to move any piece of legislation would have to contact the member or senator who is their representative hopefully you are loud enough vocal enough and convincing enough that the legislator will side with you and get the legislation moved forward
8900470 age 18 is not a simple solution to the problem people from age 18 through 21 oftentimes learn behaviors that will carry them through a lifetime
8900471 if theyve learned to drink alcohol in excess it may continue with dire circumstances on the other hand if we can find a way to promote behavior that leads to moderation we will have ensured that our students have the opportunity to pursue productive lives
8900472 on an individual cow basis we get eight percent less manure less feed less land less water when supplemented with rbst we get less methane nitrogen and phosphorus coming out of the cow
8900473 if you use rbst we needed about eight percent less land feed and we had a carbon footprint come down by seven percent
8900474 to produce the same amount of milk from organic farming we needed more land and more cows and therefore we have a higher environmental impact both in terms of the carbon footprint but also acidification and eutrophication which are about water quality
8900475 rbst has been approved now for 15 years so the time was right now to get a good look at it from an environmental standpoint
8900476 this is not a steroid hormone its a protein insulin is a protein growth hormone is the same way it has no oral activity its not transferred to the milk anyway but even if you ate the rbst youd digest it just like youd do any other protein

8900504 s lo uno de cada diez municipios dispone de guarder as p blicas
8900505 para mayor gravedad la ausencia de un plan de educaci n para la infancia por parte de la generalitat se evidencia en la flagrante falta de guarder as p blicas que existen en las tres provincias de la comunitat ya que no llegan ni al centenar de este tipo de centros para la gran demanda existente

8900509 barack obamas acceptance speech tonight wasnt what people have come to expect from a barack obama speech it wasnt filled with lofty rhetoric or grand cadences it did not induce tears or euphoria
8900510 for a speech before 80 000 people and doric columns in a football stadium barack obama might have been expected to summon winged chariots f 14s and maybe a marching band when he finished hats would be cast into the air and rent shirts would litter the floor obama didnt deliver that speech
8900511 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8900512 after three years it seems evident that the failure to restore the rights of displaced residents is as much intentional as accidental
8900513 the disparate impact that this natural disaster continues to have on low income african american residents many of whom continue to be displaced more than two years after the hurricane
8900514 apparently the bush administration believes that international treaties and agreements apply only outside u s borders
8900515 every effort is made to ensure genuine consultation and participation of persons displaced by hurricane katrina in the design and implementation of all decisions affecting them
8900516 keeping the issues alive is part of our objective as we enter the fourth year after the hurricanes

8900522 for example cubase 4 customers using sequel 2 as a musical sketch pad on a mobile computer can not only move those projects to a full scale cubase production environment for further development but they can also use the three new sequel 2 content sets for rock hip hop and industrial to kick start their creativity

8900529 he slapped at rival john mccain even as he called for an end to washingtons partisan politics including appeals for common ground on contentious issues abortion gay rights gun control and immigration and he addressed nearly every major criticism of himself and his campaign head on
8900530 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8900531 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8900532 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8900533 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead
8900534 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8900535 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8900536 i felt like i wanted to cry i felt like it was about the people he hit it out of the park
8900537 but he talked about substance hes thinking of our future and talking about all the right things thats what people need to hear
8900538 a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8900563 this is an introductory book on the subject of partial differential equations which is suitable for a large variety of basic courses on this topic in particular it can be used as a textbook or self study book for large classes of readers with interests in mathematics engineering and related fields its usefulness stems from its clarity balance and conciseness achieved without compromising the mathematical rigor one particularly attractive feature is the way in which the authors managed to emphasize the relevance of the theoretical tools in connection with practical applications

8900673 nach dem v llig un berlegten georgischen angriff auf s dossetien und der berzogenen und v lkerrechtswidrigen reaktion russlands es jetzt darauf ankommt die nerven zu bewahren und nach diplomatischen l sungen zu suchen f r abchasien und s dossetien sollte das ein umfassender autonomiestatus sein daf r braucht es aber zumindest den willen zu verhandlungen zwischen den konfliktparteien und im sicherheitsrat
8900674 sanktionen h tten die eu mit ihrer gro en energieabh ngigkeit nur selbst getroffen und keine nderung der russischen haltung bewirkt ein aussetzen der verhandlungen zum partnerschaftsabkommen halte ich aber f r angebracht

8900694 die diskussion ber die inflationsrate darf nicht verdecken dass der gro teil der sterreichischen unternehmen nach wie vor gut verdient und ein verteilungsspielraum sehr wohl vorhanden ist sterreichs arbeitnehmerinnen leiden derzeit extrem unter der hohen teuerungsrate dabei muss man auch an besch ftigte in branchen wie dem handel wo das durchschnittliche einkommensniveau gemessen am wirtschaftlichen erfolg der branche zu niedrig ist und berdurchschnittlich viele frauen arbeiten denken abschl sse unter der inflationsrate w rden die wirtschaftliche stellung dieser besch ftigtengruppen weiter schw chen und sie w rden doppelt bestraft werden

8900704 wij kunnen het ons niet permitteren om eenvoudigweg verder te gaan waar we drie jaar geleden zijn opgehouden
8900705 de wedstrijd moet weer centraal staan en niet de trainer de scheidsrechter of het publiek
8900706 wij laten zien wat er gebeurt op het veld de wedstrijd bepaalt het verhaal en niet de regisseur sommige collegas richten zich extreem op randzaken dan kwam de derde keeper in beeld die verongelijkt op de tribune zit als je dat opneemt en later in de wedstrijd toont als de eerste keeper een ongelukkige actie maakt dan manipuleer je het verslag dat doen wij niet
8900707 wij hadden graag de productie helemaal zelf willen doen de mediawet verbiedt dat
8900708 whenever you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable has to be the truth
8900709 if the oil had been discovered in nigeria before the brits decided to leave our country we would have been forever colonized our luck was their mis fortune
8900710 im 50 years old now and thats the toughest loss ive ever had we were in control of the game and it slipped away from us
8900711 youve got to give constantine credit they never quit we hit them with a pretty good punch in the first half and they came back
8900712 everyone got tired and everyone is making excuses but conditioning is the biggest thing
8900713 they got tired we got tired we were just able to hang on and continue banging the ball in
8900714 they just turned it up a notch and theyve done it every year weve played them
8900715 thats been the story of this series with constantine were usually a second half team but theyve taken it to us in the second half
8900716 its fun to be 1 0 but now heres the situation weve been 1 0 all four years ive been here but things went downhill from there in the past
8900717 so now were 1 0 as usual but we have to keep it going this time we have to play better as we go forward and we have to realize we arent anywhere near where we want to be
8900718 burr oak played hard but it was really important for us to get a shutout and to play really well
8900719 we did that so that was a huge step for us
8900720 we came out really strong scoring 31 points in the first quarter and we want to have that mentality every week starting all of our games really hot
8900721 it was good for us to get this kind of win no matter who we are playing
8900722 we just wanted to play 100 percent its not the players job to keep the score down its their job to play hard and its our job coaches to try and control the clock and control the game and im very pleased with the outcome
8900723 we want to be the kind of defense that shuts people down
8900724 thats what we did tonight and thats what we want to do every week thats what we are shooting for
8900725 by and large i would say that we played fairly well but were going to have to step it up from this point on
8900726 i can think of four great teams in the kva that really concern us right now
8900727 if we have any chance at being competitive well have to play out of our minds and not make any major mistakes for the whole season
8900728 he did all the legwork for us and brought it back to us
8900729 and we went downtown to the offices of the store and negotiated
8900730 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8900731 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8900732 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8900733 i then said to him i dont care about god bless america i just need to use the bathroom as soon as i said that he immediately pinned my arm behind my back
8900734 he shoved me out the front gate and told me get out of their country if i didnt like it
8900735 i have personal experience of dementia and understand the sadness it causes in families when someone with a zest for life and a lively personality changes out of all recognition
8900736 join in the reading alzheimers society memory walk get yourself sponsored and raise funds that go straight to supporting people with dementia and their carers in the region
8900737 last years memory walk in prospect park was a great success not only in raising funds to help local people with dementia and their carers but meeting together with other supporters to raise awareness of the effects of dementia
8900738 this years walk promises to be even better with refreshments laid on activities for children and a fantastic natural environment for a pleasant afternoon walk in good company
8900739 it was a perfect fit the contacts ive made in other agencies have been invaluable i met people in places where i would never typically have had contact now i know where to turn as issues arise
8900740 a great university is an integral part of the community that supports it programs like this one are vital two way streets
8900741 it was comforting to know that all of our professors are or were practitioners in the real world this program does an excellent job of pairing academics with real world experience and putting that information into the hands of the right people
8900742 newborn screening diagnosis and treatment are so important because early treatment of hearing loss with hearing aids and cochlear implants has been shown to result in normal and near normal acquisition of speech and language
8900743 we are excited that mexico wants to develop a program similar to the texas program and we want to support them any way we can
8900744 the richardson area is home to one of the greatest concentrations of infrared imaging companies in the united states but more than half of the engineering work force in infrared technology in north texas is expected to reach retirement age within the next decade
8900745 few universities in the nation and none in north texas provide the combination of education and practical skills necessary for engineers to contribute to infrared imaging projects
8900746 ik heb me vrijwillig laten opnemen om behandeld te kunnen worden
8900747 i thought it was heartfelt i thought it was what america needed
8900748 he touched every base and every issue he addressed the country and he made everyone feel as though hell be the next president of the united states and it was just heartfelt and im glad he did it
8900749 yeah i mean i think thats what mccain is going to do next week when he has the republican convention so i think he did it in all fairness
8900750 i think obamas speech made americans especially black americans extremely proud
8900751 i feel that his speech just continues what martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech embodied
8900752 i am finally able to vote this year and i am excited about it i never was interested in any of the elections until now he gives me hope about this country i truly think if he wins the country will come together like it should

8900755 we are hearing this morning from the political people at cbs
8900756 the romney people are saying that hes decided on pawlenty as the guy
8900757 a few connected romneyites say they think mccain has chosen tim pawlenty maybe its a head fake maybe not
8900758 they dont want us to know but they kinda want us to know anyway
8900759 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
8900760 nobody would have imagined the havoc caused by swollen kosi river there is a huge loss to life and property in north bihar districts like purnea saharsa madhepura araria and supaul
8900761 hence apart from efforts of the government there is a need for collective participation of political parties social organisations and people to take part in the relief work
8900762 we have suspended nine government officials for inciting public by their provocative statements and triggering communal clashes in the district on august 12
8900763 i dont think any conclusion can be drawn from one weeks figure
8900764 the it industry can prosper by contributing to an inclusive growth concentrating the interface between it industry and village governance
8900765 the push can come from the it industry by taking e connectivity to panchayats
8900766 as corporate responsibilty you have to do more social good to improve the quality of life todays liberalisation privatisation and globalisation should not have the negative impact of only enclave development but see growth in an equitable manner across the country
8900767 it can contribute to the global profile of india we cant afford to have this uneven growth without reaching everybody the fundamental problem of rural growth has to be addressed
8900768 the chief minister has been censured by the polit bureau for his anti bandh stand and he has not opposed it and accepted the decision
8900769 the insurance company cannot recover the alleged short payment of premium on the ground that some of the locations covered under the policy were transporters godown
8900770 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8900771 its hard to follow up believe and salmon dance as they were really successful and we were very pleased with them
8900772 the project started as always with the chems sending us the track the budget and time scale
8900773 the initial image was of a dancer dressed as a goblin in gold lam climbing out of an industrial bin on the stroke of midnight ready to have three and a half minutes of energetic fun before getting back into the bin for the end of the track
8900774 even the setting behind a theatre was part of that initial thought
8900775 the original thought was to do the whole thing as one shot with two or three dancers and the dv camera being passed from operator to operator and using a crane to follow the goblin up the side of building
8900776 we still used three dancers who all were cast for their different skills casting in london and paris because the french have some amazing street dancers
8900777 again framestore did an amazing job without getting paid and created a 3d goblin dancer that had to seamlessly join with a real one there are two sections with the 3d goblin the first from the roof of the car to the roof top the second is the jump from the roof to the window ledge
8900778 we got a choreographer supple nam on board early on and he was great
8900779 it was really fun being so hands on because you end up feeling you really have seen all the options although its a lot more work
8900780 the mask was made by david coulier who weve worked with before
8900781 it was all shot in one night around the back and inside of the astoria theatre
8900782 we had to deliver the video by a certain date and that only gave framestore a week and a half to do all the animation lighting rendering and compositing however after delivery we discovered we were able to take advantage of framestores generosity and the teams commitment to quality for another two weeks to get it to the point where both they and we wanted hooray
8900783 kondisi saya mulai meningkat saya mulai menyiapkan diri untuk kembali ke pertandingan kedua di liga nanti
8900784 kemarin saya melakukan tes saya sudah tidak merasakan sakit lagi hari ini saya bekerja keras untuk bisa bermain kembali saya berada di jalan yang benar dan saya akan kembali secepatnya

8900786 the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid
8900787 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
8900788 you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but that is not the change that america needs
8900789 after a very difficult 17 months i feel like i have finally been validated i have listened and read with horror as judge kents lawyer suggested that what happened to me was enthusiastically consensual i am relieved to find that even federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender

8900827 she made a lot of errors from both sides but more on her forehand
8900828 i think it shows a little bit lack of practice and lack of confidence in that area
8900829 she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8900830 obviously its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better this was a very disappointing loss for me but its something i have to accept especially with everything that has happened the last two months
8900831 at the beginning the crowd was kind of asleep but at the end i had the feeling that strangely they were more for me than ivanovic
8900832 everyone was congratulating me some of them players were a little too happy probably because they hope to be able to get the no 1 ranking now
8900833 my coach mentioned that she coin was from our region and i told him i thought i knew she was
8900834 this morning our paths crossed when i got here and i said to her are you the one that im not sure i recognize and she said she was
8900835 it will be a special match for her theres the dynamic of adrenalin and the emotions of such a great victory and for me its a quest to get back to my best level and put a few good matches together we are really on two different career trajectories
8900836 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year
8900837 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again theyre going to be fantastic games
8900838 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8900839 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic
8900840 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8900841 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8900842 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8900843 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8900844 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8900845 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8900846 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8901084 being that millions of parents are deeply concerned at the messages being directed towards their children on television we expect that both parties will establish clear positions on issues of broadcast decency and consumer cable choice our 1 3 million members who hold a variety of political positions can all agree that there needs to be some level of responsibility on the entertainment industry to help ensure that their children are not constantly assaulted by sex violence and profanity on television and in other media
8901085 we expect that no matter who is elected in november the new president will nominate fcc commissioners who are committed to enforcing federal broadcast decency law help to ensure that citizens will continue to have their voices heard at the fcc when it comes to indecent content that airs on broadcast television and that consumers will be able to choose and pay for only the cable networks they want so that they do not have to subsidize networks they do not want or do not watch
8901086 a majority of americans 79 agree that there is too much sex violence and coarse language on television
8901087 senator mccain has already been a leader of providing consumer cable choice and the democrats have addressed other issues in their platform we hope the republicans will also make these issues a top priority on their platform
8901088 they may agree on little else but we hope that both parties will echo a common sense commitment to restoring a culture of decency and responsibility in our country
8901089 being that millions of parents are deeply concerned at the messages being directed towards their children on television we expect that both parties will establish clear positions on issues of broadcast decency and consumer cable choice

8901091 its clear that the networks will argue anything to try to subjugate the law and ignore the will of the people

8901097 daar zie je het aantal wanbetalingen in de verenigde staten heel rap toenemen
8901098 het is voornamelijk triple a de hoogste kwaliteit en daarbij bestaat er ook een kans dat ing hypotheken die in amerika als prime hoogwaardig red te boek staan hier als alt a waardeert dat maakt het ing pakket dan hoogwaardiger dan vergelijkbare pakketten in de vs

8901212 it was great to see david get off the mark at forest when the ball fell to him i just knew he was going to score
8901213 some strikers just have that instinct that killer touch david showed that at forest and djibril did at tottenham
8901214 any player that goes to a new club wants to do well but particularly strikers and were delighted theyre off the mark hopefully therell be many more goals to come
8901215 im hopeful that we can add one more player to the squad
8901216 hopefully we can get a deal done but ive got to look at players going out as well
8901217 it wouldnt be the end of the world if i stick with the players ive got but one or two players particularly those just coming back from injuries could do with going out and getting one or two games
8901218 it does seem like yesterday when i took the job
8901219 im happy enough with the progress weve made but a lot of credit has to go to everyone connected to the club the backroom staff the supporters
8901220 were not getting carried away we know theres a lot of hard work ahead but were making nice progress
8901221 like i said about robbo yesterday i want as many good footballers at the club as possible and robert fits into that category
8901222 he has become an important member of the squad over the past 19 months and has a terrific attitude
8901223 aspirasi untuk mengugurkan pasangan calon oscar azas ini kami tampung dan akan kami sampaikan kepada ketua kpu pontianak
8901224 i would say it all adds up to a good draw for us
8901225 i see an advantage in the fact that there isnt a supposedly weak team in the group
8901226 there will be no need to send a warning to the players like you sometimes have to do when you play opposition judged weaker than you
8901227 and moreover there is no danger that there will just be three teams trying to qualify we will have to be consistent solid strong and try to take points everywhere
8901228 we want to try to do better than the quarter finals
8901229 the draw is clearly difficult we again have to play the german champions but this time it is bayern lyon had stuttgart in their group last season and that will be another pair of tough games

8901232 i temporarily leave the team where i always dreamt of playing for since i was a child
8901233 this difficult decision was taken with a total agreement with the club i wish all my team mates plenty of success
8901234 massimo oddo is a type of player who can cover the whole right flank
8901235 he will greatly increase out quality because of his experience and his tactical and technical abilities
8901236 we have had massimo oddo in our sights for a long time
8901237 we have the chance to get him and now we have used it
8901238 we are happy to sign an experienced and successful defender in massimo oddo so quickly
8901239 a further world cup and champions league winner in the ranks of bayern will stand us in good stead for the tasks that await us
8901240 i know him from our game against milan last year and also from the national team he was not easy to play against he is full of running
8901241 he has certain qualities that we could really do with i see it as positive that bayern has signed such a player

8901270 its great to finally get back into mickeys shoes after a very busy couple of years both here and in the us tony jordan and i have been discussing all sorts of stories and ideas for the next series and he has written some brilliant scripts with some classic twists im already practicing my pick pocketing
8901271 after a years break its so exciting to come up with new cons for mickey and the gang to pull on a myriad of greedy scumbags
8901272 whilst mickey has been away working the ultimate long con in oz his crew have all gone their separate ways so now hes back in blighty mickeys intent on getting back to business because as long as there is someone who wants something for nothing mickey will be there happy to take a great deal of money off their hands for nothing in return
8901273 its a great privilege to have adrian back in the hustle fold alongside audience favourites robert glenister and robert vaughn
8901274 we are delighted that adrian lester returns to hustle as mickey bricks
8901275 tony jordans wonderful scripts see him return to a different london but using the same delicious scams this series promises to offer everything that we love about hustle but with an exciting new twist
8901276 the fact weve taken the bold decision to re brand our entire entertainment portfolio in one swoop demonstrates the magnitude of our ambition and our commitment to pay tv watch gold and alibi are dynamic channel brands that are clearly identifiable full of personality and i believe will future proof our business as we head towards 2012
8901277 with its innovative marketing and strong schedule dave became almost overnight a top ten channel in multi channel homes a success that cannot be attributed solely to freeview as dave grew by 56 in pay tv this success can be replicated across the network with watch gold and alibi and enables us to exploit the potential of our real estate
8901278 weve undertaken an incredibly ambitious brand overhaul with rigorous analysis of audience needs informing all our changes watch addresses the problem of media fragmentation by putting our viewers in the picture and enabling them to catch up on modern tv classics

8901589 after x amount of years ive decided to take the open source plunge
8901590 rather than buy a new machine running windows vista or take the mac plunge i decided to walk the open source walk
8901591 dont do that will give you bad taste for linux
8901592 these monopendencies could soon turn gnome into monome making it virtually impossible in due time to use basic applications without mono somewhere in the dependecies tree moonlight is a good example of such dangers
8901593 isnt it ridiculous that its nearly impossible to avoid buying vista on a new computer even if you have no desire to get vista
8901594 i wonder if the pro software patents strategy is to solicit input from the public stack it and then claim the public demands software patents in the prior news picks item we see such a request in the uk heres one in malaysia so if you notice others in your country will you please let me know
8901595 it is licensed under the mit x11 license and the apache 2 0 license so there are no annoying licensing issues and can be mixed with anything out there

8901600 ina fried talks about brazils big linux usage but right off the bat implies it is not what the people want and not only does the author start putting linux down right from the start the author uses the last few paragraphs to promote microsofts agenda adding quotes such a 80 of linux pcs get windows installed by users within 30 days and another 10 in another 30 days
8901601 thats write the microsoft employee is quoted as saying that 90 of brazils linux pcs are getting user installed microsoft windows
8901602 the story is a pitch against linux usage and very much about microsofts products and strategies
8901603 this is classic ziff davis style of doing microsoft pr work
8901604 only the poor people of brazil would want gnu linux
8901605 if people had understood how patents would be granted when most of todays ideas were invented and had taken out patents the industry would be at a complete standstill today

8901776 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8901777 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8901778 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8901779 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8901780 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8901789 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8901790 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8901791 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni

8901797 i am delighted to get the chance to play in germany
8901798 the game is played at a very high level here and i am happy to be able to improve myself under a successful trainer im looking forward to the new challenge
8901799 it was great to see david get off the mark at forest when the ball fell to him i just knew he was going to score
8901800 some strikers just have that instinct that killer touch david showed that at forest and djibril did at tottenham any player that goes to a new club wants to do well but particularly strikers and were delighted theyre off the mark hopefully therell be many more goals to come
8901801 last season we topped the table for long periods now the players have to maintain their confidence in their own ability
8901802 theres no need to go over the top now or start analysing things too much weve only played two games after all and im convinced things will go better on saturday
8901803 it isnt as if weve just woken up from a dream
8901804 weve been saying right from the beginning that this season is all about avoiding relegation and thats not going to change
8901805 we simply have to look at the positives against stuttgart we created a lot of good chances
8901806 weve already experienced a few games in gladbach where we have played well but theyve got their noses in front we have to play our own game
8901807 we also have to careful when attacking not to be counter attacked their fast counters were the root of the past few victories over us
8901808 oli has to be patient he knows that himself we shouldnt be looking just to the bremen game we have to think long term
8901809 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8901810 it would be no surprise if rapid intensification occurred and gustav became a category 4 or 5 hurricane by 72 hours
8901811 i think everyones definitely more aware and not trying to wait until the last minute trying to be ahead of the game a little bit
8901812 recorded in 1990 available now for the first time ever
8901813 here was a singer of depth and intensity who was able to convey it all with a breezy laid back phrasing something normally assumed to be contradictory moreover and this was critical to her delivery krall had developed a mature voice and swinging comping style using good chord voicings and placing accents amp fills in all the right places
8901814 what i hope happens is the country doesnt forget the jubilation and excitement thats been generated here
8901815 and i hope it turns into something that changes the world
8901816 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8901817 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8901818 there will be some tough decisions for the final 24
8901819 final selection is in the players own hands by the form they show
8901820 we have a good mix of established players plus a few new names who have expressed the desire to join up with us
8901821 at this stage the players need to keep playing well keep fit and healthy
8901822 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8901823 they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations
8901824 if you would ask if im playing like a no 1 its no

8901911 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8901913 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8901914 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8901915 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8901916 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8901917 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8901918 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8901919 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8901920 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8901921 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8901922 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8901923 who are open to doing something on the production side
8901924 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8901925 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8901926 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8901927 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8901928 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8901929 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8901930 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8901931 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8901932 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8901933 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8901935 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8901936 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8901937 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8901938 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8901939 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8901940 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8901941 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8901942 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8901943 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8901944 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8901945 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8901946 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8901947 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8901948 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8901949 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8901950 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8901951 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8901952 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8901953 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8901954 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8901955 europsko vije e re i e da se sporazum o prekidu vatre u est to aka mora potpuno primijeniti sve dok to nije tako sporazum se razmatra
8901956 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8901957 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8901958 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8901959 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8901960 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8901961 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8901962 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8901973 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8901974 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8901975 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8901976 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8901977 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8902017 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8902018 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8902019 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8902020 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8902021 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8902022 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8902023 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8902024 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8902025 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8902026 im always living with the guilt that if im spending too much time at work then im not giving enough time to my girls
8902027 and then if im with my girls then im not doing enough for work or you name it its a guilt that we all live with in this room can i hear an amen
8902028 usually when issues get to the mayors office they have worked their way through the bureaucracy and the problems are sufficiently complicated that it takes somebody with a very level head and an honest broker and a sense of right and wrong and reason to sort them through
8902029 so we were looking for a person who could help us do that and michelle was outstanding at that
8902030 the mission of the organization was to identify and develop this next generation of nonprofit and community leaders and michelle interpreted that as trying to really find the people with the greatest passion for making a difference in their communities regardless of their background and helping turn that passion into a viable career path
8902031 and so thats a model that she really solidified for us that weve kept to this day this belief that leadership has to come from all parts of the community
8902032 what she helped us do was bring together sort of a strategy
8902033 a lot of people help mentor young people a lot of people help teach
8902034 but when she got to the power of influence about being married to a u s senator about being the wife of a rock star what did she do to affect positive change what she did is help a hospital a not for profit hospital carry out a strategy of maximizing profits
8902035 if you want good people to solve difficult issues i think the market sort of sets whats the price that we have to pay to attract and keep those people
8902036 if theres one thing that ive seen out there as ive traveled around the country over this last year is that women need an advocate in the white house now more than ever before
8902037 a libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right under any circumstances to initiate force against another human being or to advocate or delegate its initiation those who act consistently with this principle are libertarians whether they realize it or not those who fail to act consistently with it are not libertarians regardless of what they may claim
8902038 what do you think about gun control give me the short answer
8902039 if you try to take our firearms we will kill you
8902040 a libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right under any circumstances to initiate force against another human being or to advocate or delegate its initiation those who act consistently with this principle are libertarians whether they realize it or not those who fail to act consistently with it are not libertarians regardless of what they may claim
8902041 what do you think about gun control give me the short answer
8902042 if you try to take our firearms we will kill you
8902043 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
8902044 for god so loved the world he gave his only son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have ever lasting life
8902045 one of them hit me in the back of the head one grabbed my arm i turned around with my skateboard and one hit me in my mouth and one hit me right here
8902046 could infer from the circumstances that the perpetrators intended to inflict permanent injury they intended to assault
8902047 the crips and bloods are the focus for law enforcement now not only here but around the region because of the violence they perpetrate
8902048 weve started seeing more and more signs of the crips and bloods more bloods than crips
8902049 we are seeing a growing presence in the graffiti the clothing the symbols
8902050 there is some indication of activity in the district based on tagging graffiti and people flying colors and throwing signs
8902051 i think whats difficult to determine at this point is how much of that activity is associated with people who are actually bloods in sanctioned sets and people who are claiming to be affiliated but are not
8902052 they run around saying we are the ravenswood boys and everybody says so what
8902053 but if they say theyre the ravenswood bloods suddenly they have some credibility
8902054 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8902055 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8902056 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8902057 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases
8902058 one of the chiefs priorities has been to implement technology for officers
8902059 so incrementally wed like to push for more of a presence of in car video surveillance as well
8902060 the major issue is obviously the budget these can be some expense but were exploring some grant funded opportunities for the cameras

8902064 realistically we are in trouble in the pro40 now and on paper were better than that
8902065 weve played some good cricket but weve not been ruthless enough
8902066 in an ideal world wed be outside of the bottom three and be able to concentrate on the championship
8902067 if dr guma takes over it would not be a problem he is a bright economist and is well experienced
8902068 but the central bank has a good management team and the mpc is well informed
8902069 i think staying for too long at the head of an organisation might not be a good idea
8902070 she and chris want to live together they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8902071 based on this information members of police emergency services took her to the national hospital where she woke up for the first time at about 11 00 on august 22
8902072 unable to get her clothing back on he allegedly drove with her through the city
8902073 he is staying in madrid and there is no possibility of going back on that
8902074 its been rumored all over the internet ive been teasing you about it for a while and ive even let it slip in a few emails and blog posts
8902075 but our focus is still to outwork other teams and win the league championship
8902076 were going to have to keep them as fresh as possible
8902077 im going to have to be conscious about getting them on and off the field

8902090 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state
8902091 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions
8902092 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8902093 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8902094 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8902095 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8902096 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8902097 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat

8902108 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site
8902109 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
8902110 we will enter the main part of the house today and forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all the contents
8902111 there are sweetners here and there but it fails to address some of the fundamental flaws of our economic policies
8902112 our problem is competitiveness its the failure to attract investment the failure to switch our economic policy to become more resilient
8902113 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8902114 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8902115 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8902116 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8902117 were very well poised to move into zimbabwe when it opens up in fact we have a large fleet of vehicles there and we will boost that investment immediately when it opens up
8902118 if you read between the lines the numbers for the motor dealership the distributorship and the car rental i think the margins there are declining

8902121 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours hillary rodham clinton
8902122 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8902123 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5m a year
8902124 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8902125 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8902126 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible healthcare for every single american if you have healthcare my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
8902127 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79bn surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8902128 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8902139 we have benefited a lot from radio since it enhances our general knowledge we should listen to the radio as the programmes help us immensely just as our parents and teachers do
8902140 radio is very beneficial for us it answers our questions very well
8902141 after listening to the radio for half an hour students have improved significantly watching tv they can observe and listen but for the radio they have to concentrate on the subject only by listening through radio we are imparting general knowledge to the students they have been told about their regular syllabus a revision of the same lesson first in classroom and then on radio will enable students to be more proficient

8902157 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8902158 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8902159 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8902160 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8902180 i cant really speak for anybody playing or not playing
8902181 he has his own schedule to uphold if he has to play his 15 events in america then he plays his 15 events in america
8902182 but you might have thought that he would have known that before he either entered here or pulled out of here
8902183 he is very much his own man but it would have been nice to add to the field i suppose and add some colour to an already colourful event god i am being diplomatic
8902184 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while according to you guys in the press but i have not spoken to anyone about that matter and i am not sure anyone else has either i will leave that between him and the captain
8902185 i know one thing for sure rob lee you and i would have swam across to play at glenneagles at qualify
8902186 i would have wanted the opportunity to take that decision out of nick faldos hands and nail on my place in the team
8902187 i do understand what he is saying in terms of his scheduling and the way he has set up his scheduling he felt that the world rankings are massively important to him but for me the ryder cup is all about history and that is worth playing to get in to
8902188 the money and the points will always be there the ryder cup is biannual and is the chance to put your name down in history but he is adamant that this schedule is made up of people wanting his appearances all around the world and he does not want to change from that schedule
8902189 paul casey did not play in four huge tournaments in europe because they were not on his schedule he had a poor start to the season and wanted to get his ryder cup points in early but he had four weeks off where he did not even play in america
8902190 to my certain knowledge the players who do that always perform less well on both tours neither poulter nor casey have won on either tour
8902191 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8902192 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong

8902202 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8902203 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8902204 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8902205 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8902206 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8902207 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8902208 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8902209 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8902210 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8902211 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8902212 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8902213 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8902214 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8902215 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8902216 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8902217 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8902218 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8902219 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8902220 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8902221 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8902222 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8902223 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8902224 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8902225 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8902226 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8902227 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8902228 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8902229 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8902230 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8902231 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8902232 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8902233 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8902234 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8902235 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8902236 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8902237 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8902238 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8902239 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8902240 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8902241 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8902242 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8902243 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8902244 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8902245 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8902246 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8902247 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8902248 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8902249 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8902250 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8902251 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8902252 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8902253 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8902254 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8902255 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8902256 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8902257 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8902258 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8902259 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8902260 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8902261 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8902262 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8902263 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8902264 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8902265 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8902266 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8902267 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8902268 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8902269 no one works for someone we all just work together
8902270 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8902271 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8902272 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8902273 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8902274 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8902275 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8902276 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8902277 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8902278 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8902279 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8902280 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8902281 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8902282 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8902283 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8902284 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8902285 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8902286 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8902287 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8902288 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8902289 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8902290 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8902291 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8902292 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8902293 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8902294 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8902295 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8902296 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8902297 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8902298 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8902299 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8902300 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8902301 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8902302 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8902303 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8902304 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8902337 weve found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8902338 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes
8902339 this means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechano sensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose
8902340 its best to aim a bit forward of its location and try and anticipate where the fly will jump when it first sees your swatter

8902354 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8902355 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8902356 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8902357 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8902358 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8902359 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8902360 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8902361 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army

8902368 relying on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a settlement of local conflicts
8902369 that the court was not the place to solve the cyprus problem
8902370 the cyprus problem is primarily a political problem a problem of invasion and occupation with aspects relating to property and it cannot be solved comprehensively through the courts
8902371 its a bizarre situation where a greek cypriot brought an action against turkey and they settled for an exchange of property and now turkey will be promoting the position of the greek cypriot in the committee of ministers because the cyprus government has not given effect to the settlement

8902374 theres no time to waste on the stupid argument that such a deadly movement as the islamicist represents a sort of cry for help or is a thwarted expression of poverty and powerlessness only a complete moral idiot can believe for an instant that we are fighting against the wretched of the earth we are fighting against the scum of the earth
8902375 there can be no compromise between modern society and the raving of those who study dream and are deluded by wild prophecies and who regard women as chattel and unbelievers as sacrificial animals
8902376 it is impossible to compromise with the stone faced propagandists for bronze age morality morons and philistines who hate darwin and einstein and who managed during their brief rule in afghanistan to ban and to erase music and art while cultivating the skills of germ warfare in confronting such people the crucial thing is to be willing and able if not in fact eager to kill them without pity before they can get started
8902377 george bush may subjectively be a christian but he and the us armed forces have objectively done more for secularism than the whole of the american agnostic community combined and doubled the demolition of the taliban the huge damage inflicted on the al qaeda network and the confrontation with theocratic saboteurs in iraq represent huge advances for the non fundamentalist forces in many countries

8902388 the number of deaths in the riots was very high mainly because of the brutal repression of the protests by the bir people are now too afraid to speak out against anything because of the repression of those demonstrations
8902389 nothing could justify such a punitive action since the bir already has a clear mission and the youths protests against miserable living conditions were legitimate
8902390 this was a special operation and as a general rule the bir does not operate in cities but in this case the countrys security was threatened and we had to do everything possible to restore peace
8902391 the bir must secure a vast territory for its actions to be effective it would need to increase its staff to at least 3 000 and to not be sidetracked for police or gendarmerie operations

8902490 the biggest question is does michael jackson want to come back at 50 has he got the energy has he got the desire his career has been a rollercoaster over the last ten years and crucially im not sure hes got the appetite to
8902491 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8902492 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8902493 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8902494 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8902495 its one of my all time favourites even before i first came here which was back in 2002 for a formula renault race i played it on my computer it was always one of the best tracks it has probably the most exciting corner in formula one eau rouge and its one of the few circuits where you really feel like youre actually going somewhere you blast off into the forest and get to the top of the hill and can feel the whole circuit beneath you its one of the best challenges in formula one
8902496 i dont regret it but its a shame i prefer the more historic circuits like monza silverstone and monaco you really feel the history of those places whenever you race there they have real character each time they are refurbished they lose a little more of their individuality but they are made safer so we can continue to race on them so thats a good compromise
8902497 when you talk about spa everybody thinks about eau rouge but the bigger challenge is pouhon its a sweeping downhill left hander and is very fast indeed its almost flat but not quite so its quite tricky to find a balance that allows you to attack without going off drivers love corners like this high speed turns that are not quite flat thats where the real excitement lies because its up to the driver to make the difference
8902498 spa is a big fast circuit and still feels a little bit dangerous for a driver that always gives you an added element of excitement its fast and narrow almost like a street circuit between the trees and its long so its very difficult to string a good lap together the most important thing you need here is bravery you really need to attack the corners faster than your brain is telling you to youve got to keep the throttle flat even if it doesnt look possible you have to trust your instincts and just put the danger out of your mind its a real drivers circuit
8902499 the reality is that we have tremendous faith in our colleagues at mercedes benz and feel comfortable with both our engines performance and reliability the recent engine failures suffered by ferrari in hungary and valencia clearly demonstrate that even a homologated engine can break so we take nothing for granted theres always an element of risk whenever you come to two fast and demanding circuits but we have the additional security of knowing both our drivers can each still suffer an engine failure without receiving a 10 place grid penalty
8902500 weve got a number of smaller aero developments in the pipeline theres nothing on the car that will be visually very startling but theres plenty of detail work were also focusing on further mistake proofing our systems the championship is going to be a hard fought slog until the end of the year and we need to leave no stone unturned in our quest for additional performance and improved reliability from a human and physical perspective these two races are also pivotal to our title challenge its vital that every member of the team pulls together to make sure these races pass without undue incident and set us up nicely for the final flyaway races
8902501 yes indeed we wanted to win nevertheless our result in valencia is no reason for us to feel disappointed we scored 13 points which continues the trend of the previous three races since silverstone we have scored 55 out of 72 possible points in those four races and reduced the gap to the top of the constructors ranking from 33 to eight points
8902502 the top four in the drivers world championship are covered by 15 points which is an exciting basis for the seasons finale five different drivers from three teams won the 12 races so far apart from the speed necessary for winning obviously the reliability of the technical package will play the most important role we have to be top class when it comes to scoring points and everybody in the team is working hard to achieve this
8902503 the track of spa francorchamps is the longest on the formula one calendar at over seven kilometres and after monza where we will race one week later the one with the second highest average speed of all grand prix circuits in qualifying last year this was 238 km h

8902533 one of the priorities within the inverness command area is to increase police visibility wherever possible
8902534 following the trial period a review will be carried out having officers at the hospital during these times will provide reassurance and act as a deterrent
8902535 we believe this will act both as a deterrent to violent and aggressive behaviour and may encourage victims of crime to report offences
8902536 it is important people waiting in the emergency department can do so without fear of being subjected to or witness to physical and verbal abuse

8902573 the naysayers never understand that this election is not about me its about you the american people
8902574 john mccain needs to understand something that people who serve in the military already know that is that those who bled for and served their country did so whether they were republicans or democrats patriotism has no party

8902579 in terms of a move to bught park for caley thistle i would never say never
8902580 we would obviously have to speak to a number of other parties and sports as i would perceive it as being more of a centre of sporting excellence rather than simply a stadium for football
8902581 caley thistle would of course play a significant part but it would be very much a facility that all the community could use as well
8902582 the latest figures have to be taken in context with the surplus weve made over the previous two years
8902583 when you consider that the transfer fee for marius niculae has still to be taken into account then theres certainly no cause for concern
8902584 our commercial department is continuing to work hard on cultivating new avenues for income and hopefully these will come to fruition in the near future
8902585 i know that there have been suggestions about a new club shop or even a museum at the ground but first and foremost we must remain focused on the fact that we are a football club
8902586 we are not retailers we must concentrate on what we do and that is to run a club that generates funds for investment in the team

8902596 does your handbag deserves a seat why havent you bought it a ticket if everyone who has a bag buys it a ticket i have no problem with that
8902597 an extreme way of looking at our current workplace situation is that millions of people every day drag themselves to their cubicles at great cost to the individual organisation and environment so that they can send emails to the next cubicle
8902598 it is estimated that buildings contribute more than 30 per cent of global greenhouse emissions and yet they are one of our most underutilised assets
8902599 an increase of around 30 40 per cent in the utilisation of public transport roads and office buildings and an end to the crushing futility of the morning and evening peak hour rush
8902600 i believe he the attacker had been to the house on previous occasions and may have lived in the district

8902604 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8902605 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 per cent of the time
8902606 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8902607 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8902608 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8902609 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8902610 obviously ive accepted that offer and i in the meantime assume the portfolios he holds
8902611 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address these matters expeditiously
8902612 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously mr peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation and he will be offering total co operation to the serious fraud office
8902613 mr peters is offering his total co operation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers and the office will take place tomorrow morning

8902615 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8902616 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our service men
8902617 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8902618 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative

8902701 one day at about 8 30am i woke up to a large hacking sound i went out to my window and saw 4 5 men in khadi chopping down the tree outside shocked as how they could do this i ran down to stop them but was told that they have received orders from the bmc and there was nothing i could do to stop them
8902702 after asking around i found out that as a citizen i can lodged a complaint with the police and they have been very helpful and questioned the officer concerned the police have also questioned the garden department and are awaiting a reply along with that i have also started circulating a petition and have over a hundred signatures protesting this act and have submitted it to the bmc all i ask of them is to replant a tree to make up for the one they cut but they are just dragging on giving some excuse or the other
8902703 they have cut the tree a bit too much and ive informed the bmc as well citizens should be aware of whats happening in their locality they can stop the cutting of a tree if they feel that its unnecessary or done too much

8902714 much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8902715 this is the same system we have in place today
8902716 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8902717 may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8902718 at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily

8902747 sugar free is obviously stepping up in trip a couple of furlongs so we will have to see how she gets on
8902748 she ran well at royal ascot and will definitely get six furlongs but whether she will get the seven furlongs we are unsure
8902749 jamie spencer rides her though and we are hopeful shell run well
8902750 the first direction that we look in is obviously to the red bull young driver programme and then well see but we are not quite ready yet
8902751 we dont really have a list in our heads at this stage we are far from saying its this one or that one because we are also waiting to see if something happens elsewhere and probably then well get a new chance
8902752 in formula 1 you have to give someone half a year of time before you start to judge him
8902753 the half year is over and he is now in a situation where he has to prove his talents
8902754 i would not say that i already have a clear opinion on him but i also have to say that sebastian vettel started a couple of races before and he performed very well in the first half year
8902755 so we will have to see how the second half goes for sebastien bourdais and honestly i dont want to be drawn into an expression of opinion at this very moment

8902785 people still are used to deflation and now theyre starting to see the prices of their daily necessities going up sharply
8902786 the package may be able to put out some of the sparks caused by rising prices but it is unlikely to extinguish the origins of the flame
8902787 what the japanese economy needs are not makeshift measures but action to drastically change the economic structure so that japan can survive the rapidly changing circumstances in the global economy
8902788 signs that economic activity is proving fairly resilient as well as growing hope that inflation is close to a peak means there is little sense of desperation among policy makers

8902816 it is necessary to watch the daily lives of ordinary citizens and quickly respond to their pain and concerns
8902817 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8902818 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8902819 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
8902820 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
8902821 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house

8902836 a successful takeover bid would make up for square enixs weakness in
8902837 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8902838 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8902839 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8902840 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8902841 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8902842 it is expected to take several days to carry out the search because of the scale of the buildings and the extent of the devastation
8902843 there must have been at least three seats to this fire given the vast area it covered and the distances between the destroyed buildings
8902844 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8902845 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8902846 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers

8902849 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8902850 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8902852 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8902853 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8902854 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8902855 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8902856 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8902857 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8902858 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8902859 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8902860 you could despair but as a socialist as a marxist you always feel then perhaps one day
8902861 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire
8902862 weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done
8902863 but we are confident that the resources and policies now in place will deliver improved policing for scotland
8902864 but without scottish conservative pressure and insistence there would be no prospect of 1 000 more police no new national drugs strategy and no accelerated tax cuts for scotlands smallest businesses
8902865 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8902866 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8902867 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8902868 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8902869 ensure that renewable energy developments have been located and designed in such a way to minimise increases in ambient noise levels
8902870 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8902871 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8902872 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8902873 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8902874 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8902875 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8902876 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8902877 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8902878 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8902879 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8902880 ive dreamed of playing in a fla flu match since i was a boy
8902881 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8902882 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8902883 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8902884 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8902885 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8902886 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8902887 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8902888 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8902889 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8902890 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8902891 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8902892 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8902893 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8902894 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8902895 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8902896 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8902897 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8902898 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8902899 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8902900 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8902901 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8902902 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8902903 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8902904 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8902905 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8902906 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8902907 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8902908 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8902909 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8902910 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8902911 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8902912 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8902913 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8902914 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8902915 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8902916 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8902917 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8902918 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8902919 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8902920 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8902921 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8902922 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8902923 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8902924 i just heard a big boom and i jumped up and i saw the car inside the house everybody was hollering and screaming at one time it was kind of confusing you didnt know if someone was hurt or not

8902935 todays youths are not interested in taking up indigenous crafts after getting education they want to get employed in the government and private companies thus there is a huge dearth of skilled artisans
8902936 super terrorism in this perspective can be defined as projected future use of chemical biological nuclear and radiological weapons by terrorist groups
8902937 adequate security personnel are there at the factory site and we are keeping a watch on the situation

8902946 sticks and stones can break your bones but words can never hurt you
8902947 it certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and cultures and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8902948 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8902949 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
8902950 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
8902951 at a time of growing economic uncertainty it may be that couples want to try to resolve marital issues before considering divorce
8902952 at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected over the last few months

8902954 we have suspended nine government officials for inciting public by their provocative statements and triggering communal clashes in the district on august 12
8902955 the workers and the executives were afraid and worried and our foremost priority was to ensure their safety hence the management decided to evacuate its manpower from the plant late last evening
8902956 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night so it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8902957 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again

8902960 everyone on the council is aware that the site needs to be redeveloped
8902961 there is potential for a lot of housing and a lot of jobs and we do not want to stand in the way of that
8902962 the main concern was that of over development on the site members were very concerned as to the amount of traffic in the area that would have come about as a result of the development
8902963 we were also worried about the impact on the listed buildings and surrounding conservation area
8902964 we gave a huge amount of consideration to the application there is a lot of skill and experience on the planning committee and we felt there wasnt a sufficient amount of detail in the proposed plans give it the green light
8902965 i would hope that grantside would take on board the comments that the council has made we would most certainly be open to an amended scheme
8902966 politicians should change their attitude towards sports by ensuring their sincere participation in the promotion of games in the country
8902967 in us politicians not only take keen interest in sports but also keeps any eye on each and every sports by ensuring their presence in the grounds
8902968 people have started taking interest in sports in the country and if the trend continues then we will win more medals in london olympics
8902969 sports should be encouraged by providing quality infrastructure and latest equipments the government indian olympic association and other sports bodies have to play important roles
8902970 the people of assam and even most of the ulfa cadre want peace so they have decided to surrender
8902971 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8902972 i thought i can slowly get into the match she played completely different than i expected serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8902973 i made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8902974 i have to put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8902975 i feel it would be in the interests of pakistan democracy and the pakistan peoples party that this office of president remains above controversy and i would humbly request mr zardari that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest and in interest of democratic stability
8902976 i do not want to comment on a persons mental health
8902977 i am preparing for the start of the new icl season this year and so far no one has told me not to practice here
8902978 there was never any ban on shabbir ahmed to practice he is only banned from representing pakistan in tests and odis and from first class cricket
8902979 he is a pakistani and we have no objection in his practicing at nca
8902980 any player who has represented pakistan can practice here but that does not mean we are thinking about changing our policy on the icl it remains the same when the icc recognises it we will also adopt a softer line

8902983 the concept behind kind of blue grew out of the way the two miles and evans played together
8902984 evans and davis were certainly on the same wavelength and the pianist certainly contributes more than a sidemans share of kind of blues air of pensive melancholy in addition to which his eloquent liner notes titled improvisation in jazz cued listeners to hear the album as the very essence of jazz an unmediated exercise in spontaneity
8902985 took place in the nick of time its impossible to imagine davis evans coltrane and adderley coming together so harmoniously a year or two later by which point each had become not just leader of his band but practically founder of his own school
8902986 the last king of america how miles davis invented modernity
8902987 kind of blue would not have been possible if the lp did not exist
8902988 it was jazz conceived for the record album not only because of the playing times of the tunes but also because of how the album creates an overall mood kind of blue is not simply a series of tracks as the standard small group jazz album of the day was kind of blue was one of the few jazz records of its time that had a sense of narrative a cohesive inter relation between the tunes it was a work not a bunch of disparate tunes used to pace a small group jazz album one fast tempo piece one ballad one blues one or two standards a bop oriented original the sense of the album as an organic whole added to its appeal
8902989 improvising on the sparest and starkest of scales as an alternative to bebops dense thickets of chord changes
8902990 sprang verbatim from evans introduction to alone together on an earlier recording of that standard by chet baker
8902991 along with dave brubecks time out another columbia jazz record released in 1959 that made jazz a middlebrow music a respectable music for middle class educated people who felt they had refined taste this was enormously important for davis both commercially and artistically for the rest of his career as jazz ceased to be dance music it needed middlebrow status in order to survive as art music davis was essential in making this transformation possible

8903044 we are going to find out exactly what we have where we will be and what we need to do to improve
8903045 its a good deal for us usually teams have to wait a while before they find out so im glad of that

8903049 people are concerned that 50 years from now it will be warm beyond a point of no return my concern is almost opposite that its cold and getting colder
8903050 as north america emerged from its coldest and snowiest winter for decades the us national climate data center run by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa issued a statement that snow cover in january on the eurasian land mass had been the most extensive ever recorded and that in the us march had been only the 63rd warmest since records began in 1895
8903051 ice cover around the bering strait and alaska that month was at its highest level ever recorded at the same time antarctic sea ice cover was also at its highest ever level 30 per cent above normal
8903052 snow cover over north america and much of siberia mongolia and china is greater than at any time since 1966
8903053 nasa satellites found that last winters arctic sea ice covered 2 million square kilometers 772 000 square miles more than the last three years average
8903054 we have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
8903055 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
8903056 all those urging action to curb global warming need to take off the blinkers and give some thought to what we should do if we are facing global cooling instead
8903057 this warmth peaked in 1998 and the temperature trend the last decade has been flat even as co2 has increased 5 5 percent cooling began in 2002 over the last six years global temperatures from satellite and land temperature gauges have cooled 0 14 f and 0 22 f respectively ocean buoys have echoed that slight cooling since the national oceanic and atmospheric administration deployed them in 2003
8903058 gilles langis a senior forecaster with the canadian ice service in ottawa says the arctic winter has been so severe the ice has not only recovered it is actually 10 to 20 cm thicker in many places than at this time last year
8903059 direct temperature measurements on greenland ice cores show a cooling trend between 1940 and 1995 dahl jensen et al 1998
8903060 the northern hemisphere would appear to be not much warmer now and the extent of barents sea ice cover not much less now than it was sometime during the 1700s when the airs co2 concentration was on the order of 90 100 ppm less than it is now
8903061 reports based on submarine sonar data have suggested arctic sea ice has thinned nearly by half in only recent decades such rapid thinning is a concern for detection of global change and for arctic regional impacts re examining the inferred thinning while including atmospheric timeseries ocean currents rivers runoff and modelled physics of ocean ice snow we find that inferred rapid thinning was unlikely varying winds which rapidly redistribute arctic ice create a difficult sampling problem dominated by a recurring pattern where ice is expelled from the central arctic while thickening in the canadian sector
8903062 analysis of records figures 2 3 also shows that long term ice trends are small and generally not statistically significant
8903063 previous studies showed that at time scales of up to decades sea ice conditions are controlled by changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern our study extends this result suggesting that even at interdecadal time scales winds remain the major contributor to ice extent variation in the siberian marginal ice zone
8903064 recent studies show sea conditions in the arctic today are similar to conditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries while average arctic temperatures are rising almost to their levels of the 1930s
8903065 temporal and spatial variation of surface air temperature over the period of instrumental observations in the arctic
8903066 the latest measurements of antarctic climate show that the main part of the continent is cooling and has been for some time doran et al 2002 changes in antarctic ice that we do observe are part of the normal post wisconsin interglacial process not a recent artifact of human influence on climate conway et al 1999
8903067 our 14 year continuous weather station record from the shore of lake hoare reveals that seasonally averaged surface air temperature has decreased by 0 7 degrees celsius per decade the temperature decrease is most pronounced in summer and autumn continental cooling especially the seasonality of cooling poses challenges to models of climate and ecosystem change
8903068 overall the total antarctic sea ice extent the cumulative area of grid boxes covering at least 15 ice concentrations has shown an increasing trend 4 801 km2 yr
8903069 the total antarctic sea ice area the cumulative area of the ocean actually covered by at least 15 ice concentrations has increased significantly by 13 295 km2 yr exceeding the 95 confidence level
8903070 the upward trends in the total ice extent and area are robust for different cutoffs of 15 20 and 30 ice concentrations used to define the ice extent and area
8903071 major past climate changes were either uncorrelated with changes in co2 or were characterized by temperature changes that preceded changes in co2 by hundreds to thousands of years
8903072 c hanges in co2 concentration cannot be claimed to be the cause of changes in air temperature for the appropriate sequence of events temperature change following co2 change is not only never present it is actually violated in at least half of the record
8903073 the co2 decrease lags the temperature decrease by several thousand years
8903074 the same sequence of climate forcing operated during each termination
8903075 the time lag of the rise in co2 concentrations with respect to temperature change is on the order of 400 to 1000 years during all three glacial interglacial transitions
8903076 the co2 increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years
8903077 exhibits no systematic correspondence with the geologic record of climatic variations at tectonic time scales
8903078 atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for the last 500 million years
8903079 of all the potential climate forcing mechanisms solar variability superimposed on long term changes in insolation bond et al 2001 denton and karlen 1973 mayewski et al 1997 obrien et al 1995 seems to be the most likely important forcing mechanism
8903080 changes in the concentrations of co2 and ch4 appear to have been more the result than the cause of the rccs
8903081 the surprising result of these long range predictions is a rapid decline in solar activity starting with cycle 24
8903082 astrophysics knows two solar activity cycles of 11 and 200 years both are caused by changes in the radius and area of the irradiating solar surface the latest data obtained by habibullah abdusamatov head of the pulkovo observatory space research laboratory say that earth has passed the peak of its warmer period and a fairly cold spell will set in quite soon by 2012 real cold will come when solar activity reaches its minimum by 2041 and will last for 50 60 years or even longer
8903083 kenneth tapping of our own national research council canada who oversees a giant radio telescope focused on the sun is convinced we are in for a long period of severely cold weather if sunspot activity does not pick up soon
8903084 studies show that by the end of the 20th century the suns activity may have been at its highest for more than 8 000 years

8903117 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8903118 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8903119 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8903120 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8903121 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan

8903172 the research does indicate that there is a relationship between advertising and childrens food and beverage preferences and requests
8903173 it also indicates a relationship between television viewing as distinct from television advertising specifically and obesity in children however existing research does not clearly demonstrate a causal relationship between any of these factors and obesity and indeed only a modest association is apparent
8903174 it is unconscionable to think that a considered review of childrens television standards would not include protecting children from the influence of junk food advertising
8903175 it is absurd for acma to allege that advertising junk food to children does not influence their desire for and consumption of these foods
8903176 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8903177 from the facts available to us you are not a true muslim and you are hereby given two days to divorce 82 wives from your 86 wives and if you fail to do so we cannot guarantee your safety in bida and the entire nupe kingdom and as such you should pack your load and leave

8903186 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8903187 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions

8903226 and that their voting choices are wise wisdom means that we see things from gods perspective put first things first and discern whats important and whats not one of the practical effects of such wisdom is that we realize that when the state fails to protect the right to life it ceases to be a true democracy and instead becomes a tyrant state

8903230 at saddleback he obama assured a reporter that hed have voted yes on that bill if it had contained language similar to the federal version of the born alive infants protection act
8903231 even though the language of both the state and federal bills was identical senator obama said people were quote lying about his record
8903232 when that record was later produced he dropped the subject but didnt withdraw the slander and now even senator obamas campaign has conceded that his claims and accusations were false
8903233 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8903234 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8903235 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8903236 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8903237 i am not surprised by this decision but i am still relieved to hear it
8903238 it was a dreadful application and badly proposed but we could not be sure it would be refused until we heard from ms blears

8903248 the real obstacle to studying bumblebees is that we cant find the nests

8903253 we see it as a crisis really the lack of involvement of men
8903254 weve looked at all the data and said somebodys got to do something
8903255 we will give you all the support that is necessary we will do all those things that we feel are within our powers to do but most importantly i will say god gives power but within our own realm here nobody gives power you have to take it
8903256 i am glad that to an extent you made comments about me coming from your constituency very flattering but i will also say to you that former president obasanjos first coming as head of state was at 38 as well former head of state general yakubu gowon who also was 29
8903257 so we have always had our say in nigerian government that is what i am trying to tell you that we are partly part of the people responsible for nigeria as it is today we are always given chances to redeem ourselves and to do what is right
8903258 so this is another chance what you do with your parliament depends entirely on you you could be docile you could be active
8903259 you will have caucuses like we always do different positions would be taken on different issues
8903260 you would be forced to speak on these issues you would be respected on the positions you take and you get a lot of mileage on the positions you take
8903261 you are not likely to be rewarded for those positions at least not in the short term but in the long term i can assure you that those you would be doing this for would benefit from the positions you take
8903262 if current trends continue obama will be drowning out those ads
8903263 obama wont be outgunned thats one of the advantages of having money
8903264 the obama campaign is not afraid to deviate from its national message to put out these local fires
8903265 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look

8903291 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8903292 but its not terribly low 7 9 percent is still high by historical standards
8903293 our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
8903294 until we can achieve those reforms 10 percent remains an unattainable target
8903295 the monsoons have been disappointing this year and raise the probability of agriculture growth coming in at sub 3 percent

8903364 we know so much about the other offenses that we know what to do before we play them
8903365 im trying to take it one day at a time with the girls and our big thing is to try to get better as a team

8903373 but that was last year the seniors really have a chance to leave a legacy this year

8903375 shes even better this year than she was last year
8903376 specifically her passing and defense have been better shes always been a really good player but to be a complete player she has to focus on that end of it and shes done a really good job
8903377 and by the time shes done here i expect her to be one of the best players not just in the county but in the state

8903418 with activity remaining subdued in the first half of 2008 and into 2009 and inflation continuing its decline the case for ecb rate easing will become more forceful
8903419 the crips and bloods are the focus for law enforcement now not only here but around the region because of the violence they perpetrate
8903420 a lot of people like to say someone is a wannabe
8903421 someone who wants to be is more dangerous than someone who is because they are trying to prove something
8903422 if you approach them right they will offer right out that they are a member of the crips or bloods because they are proud of it
8903423 i think in canada if were not in recession were mighty close to it
8903424 its one of those funny recessions though in that domestic demand is still very positive and real incomes are actually rising because of the rising commodity prices

8903475 at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8903476 he was trying to be specific because hes been criticized for being too vague
8903477 but he offered too many specifics on too many things and i dont know how you do it if you provide health care for everyone and still cut taxes and shrink government you deserve a nobel prize
8903478 and ive seen it in this campaign in the young people who voted for the first time
8903479 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8903480 your letter overreaches and is preventing some local election officials from performing their duties as required by law and directive

8903484 its not a charity were running it has to be paid for
8903485 i know honestly that the cynical among us are going to think what they may and i dont care what they think because i am quite comfortable with the facts and legally ethically and morally weve done everything to standards
8903486 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8903487 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8903488 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8903489 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8903490 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8903491 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8903492 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8903493 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8903494 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is that youre on your own
8903495 that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8903496 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8903497 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped my life and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8903498 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8903501 that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8903502 and it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8903503 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8903504 the real obstacle to studying bumblebees is that we cant find the nests

8903506 i believe the economic expansion under way and the skills challenges we face signal that this is exactly where we need to concentrate our planning and investment for the decade ahead

8903589 irish motorists have paid for the m50 motorway many times over through tolls paid to the private company national toll roads ntr over a period of eighteen years now that the ownership of the west link bridge has passed to the state motorists should no longer be made to pay these unfair charges
8903590 the governments reluctance to invest money in major irish roads and its dependence on private partnership arrangements with private companies for the building of our roads has led to a situation where irish motorists have paid for the m50 motorway many times over
8903591 this is totally unacceptable at a time of economic instability when everyone is feeling the pinch the government should be looking at ways to ease the burden on the public lifting these unfair and unnecessary tolls would be one way of doing this
8903592 had the government invested public money in the building of the m50 in the first place tolls would have ended many years ago and the 600 million buyout of ntr would not be necessary
8903593 the most worrying part of all this is that the government seems to have learnt nothing from this episode

8903620 the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about worth the agony and the sweat he must learn them again he must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid and teaching himself that forget it forever leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truth of the heart the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice

8903746 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8903747 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8903748 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8903749 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers

8903753 public toilets in delhi an emphasis on the facilities for women in slum areas
8903754 a man has options but a woman cant urinate in the open as that is deemed uncultured the issue of public toilets affects women the most especially poor women
8903755 people talk about feminism all the time but nobody thinks of a need as basic as a toilet for them despite the fact that our chief minister and mayor are both women
8903756 we are preparing ourselves for the commonwealth games and its horrible that the citys civic agencies do not even perform their basic duties its a violation of the rights of citizens especially women who have no option but to defecate in the open
8903757 one day during my internship with ccs i saw a woman cleaning a public toilet at yusuf sarai it struck me that though she was cleaning the toilet she herself couldnt use it since it was meant only for men like most public toilets in delhi i decided to find out the real status of public conveniences in the city
8903758 in the indian context its sad but true that an ideal woman is one with a dress a smile and a vagina no one cares to look at the number of pipes and organs in her body that are there to give birth to a life and that she needs a hygienic toilet
8903759 officials from the slum department of the mcd said the norm in slum areas is one latrine seat for 150 people and a 20 20 20 latrine seats for men and 20 latrine seats for women for a plot meant for 500 households
8903760 the mcd should make it mandatory for companies who show interest in constructing repairing and maintaining toilets on a bot basis in lucrative areas to also do the same in slum and resettlement areas
8903761 pay and use toilet facilities for women can work as a policy for slum areas every adult can make a one time deposit of rs 100 towards the maintenance fund for the constructed public toilet

8903791 estamos preparados tanto en lo que se refiere a la puesta a punto de la moto como a los neum ticos todo ello nos autoriza a tener confianza
8903792 sin la ca da de stoner no habr a ganado probablemente
8903793 s que se lesion palermo al que le mando una pronta recuperaci n y tuve una llamada por parte de boca pero no prosperaron las negociaciones uno est bien ac pero tambi n realista y sabe que cambia el f tbol d a a d a que te llame boca es algo importante sobre todo si eres argentino yo no me lo esperaba porque fue todo de un d a para otro
8903794 creo que han llegado muy buenos refuerzos y tambi n somos buenos los que est bamos en la plantilla si bien hubo fases en las que no lo demostrados creo que tenemos equipo para no pasar apuros
8903795 hay que pregunt rselo a alguno que tenga la bola de cristal pero lo que tenemos que hacer es ganar los tres puntos y comenzar ganando que me comentan los compa eros que llevamos varios a os sin hacerlo siempre es motivante arrancar ganando el recreativo es un gran equipo pero nosotros confiamos en nuestras posibilidades
8903796 tratamos de estar m s equilibrados y tener la pelota m s para que el betis sea m s protagonista y as lastimar cuando lleguemos al ataque lo ideal es manejar el juego y ser equilibrado en la l nea creo que los jugadores que han llegado nos van a aportar eso que fue lo que nos falt en parte de la liga pasada
8903797 parece que hay una bruja pinchando a los delanteros se han lesionado todos los de arriba y nos hemos quedado sin variantes de hecho hoy el mister ha tenido que probar con juande arriba y con babic de extremo lo bueno es la predisposici n de los jugadores a participar en un puesto que no es el suyo por lo menos en lo personal la ilusi n est a todos los futbolistas nos gustan los domingos y tener la afici n apoy ndote
8903798 el mister es el que mejor sabe qu nos hace falta por la forma de jugar a lo mejor estoy yo solo de nueve nueve el resto puede jugar por las bandas yo no a lo mejor se busca un delantero de mis caracter sticas para que haya m s variedad sobis hasta ahora sigue como siempre entrenando con normalidad desgraciadamente el otro d a tuvo un golpe pero nosotros no sabemos nada de una salida
8903799 en lo que va de 2008 ha debutado y por lo que he visto por televisi n ha tenido muy buenas cr ticas por eso fue a la sub 23 de los juegos ol mpicos y estuvo a punto de ir a la absoluta la realidad es que no s qu va a pasar con l porque no he hablado
8903800 i view this deliberate attempt to subvert the executive as an act of the utmost bad faith
8903801 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofm dfm without the agreement of sinn fein people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics
8903802 the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority it is weak politics and no way to do business
8903803 the strategy which you have published is not the strategy which was agreed by the executive on 10 april i have sought and received legal advice on this and consider you to be in clear breach of your ministerial duties and that you have acted unlawfully
8903804 i would be grateful for an urgent response from you setting out the steps required to rectify this situation
8903805 if we cannot trust colleagues to take forward a decision agreed by the executive then this is a very worrying and dangerous situation
8903806 in these circumstances i am also seeking an urgent meeting of the executive as soon as possible to discuss this important matter it may be that the executive can resolve the situation without recourse to the high court
8903807 the regional development strategy produced by drd is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level it would suit mr robinson better if he used his time engaging in the process of intensive dialogue he committed his party to in june to sort out serious issues
8903808 if she doesnt get home on time im not sure whats going to happen now we were looking forward to her coming home for one week before she goes to university in dundee
8903809 i tried to phone calgary airport today but all the phone lines are busy i tried to ring zooms phonelines but their offices are closed its a long weekend here in calgary for labour day so all the hotels are getting booked out as well
8903810 they obviously knew what was happening and they put us through all the security i went to boarding at 4 05pm and the girl said there is a slight delay with zoom because of incoming flights this morning
8903811 i think it will be a very very long hard winter for airline industry and i think come the spring in europe of sure a number of airlines wont be with us
8903812 if they sneeze american airlines a lot of people in europe say that the british are getting flu which is unhelpful
8903813 i didnt want the interval to come he mark had time to regroup and it showed in the second session
8903814 mark fought his way back into the match rather than me making mistakes he showed what hes capable of in those three frames he won
8903815 he plays far too openly so hell have to change but im sure he will do hell learn that he has to adapt
8903816 for the crowd and for the fans back at home its nice to see someone wind up and have a go
8903817 you dont mind taking shots on when its 50 50 but he was taking shots on which were 20 80 in his favour
8903818 i felt as if i was hitting the ball well but i missed a couple of balls i couldnt really believe
8903819 im happy though the conditions out there were first class ive criticised them in the past but i hold my hands up because theyve been superb it was good to get over the line
8903820 kc has taken a step back this year but vermes has done a good job of not only hiring a very promising young coach in curt onalfo but also in remaking an old and underperforming kc roster

8903829 i really think it is quite shameful that minister murphy has imposed his grubby republican speak on planning documents
8903830 it is offensive and wrong to so politicise a planning document that it has chapters headed the spatial development strategy for the north and the rural area of the north of ireland likewise the text is riddled with such inaccurate and political language in similar vein the second city of northern ireland londonderry is constantly referred to as derry which is not its name
8903831 now it seems murphy hoodwinked his colleagues and surreptitiously inserted his republican propaganda this demonstrates the bad faith with which republicans misuse their government office
8903832 a learning by unionists of this further lesson in the unworkability of mandatory coalition and the untrustworthiness of sinn fein
8903833 there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest there is intent even if there was recklessness that is not enough there has to be clear intention if someone submitting a document and if that document may not be correct they still have to have intent that they know it will result in a prejudice or inducement to someone else to do something
8903834 what would happen if every solicitor was investigated in relation to something like this
8903835 i have looked very carefully at the statements of evidence in this case it gives me no pleasure to say i return you for trial
8903836 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that

8903851 rishi hein the hebrew school director is very progressive in her thinking and i really like the curriculum
8903852 i did take a look at other temples but i like their style they are going to connect content not just teach hebrew but teach the culture the history and incorporate it into real life
8903853 our goal is to educate jewish people as far as heritage our way of life and observance this is what we do and hebrew school is just another forum for doing that
8903854 the children who are currently enrolled happen to be affiliated with certain temples in the community
8903855 their parents just havent found a place for their child and maybe we are a better fit for their family or child were not here to take children out of other hebrew schools
8903856 its not as intensive we meet about once a month its not a hebrew program but more of a cultural education
8903857 we wanted tabetha to have more hebrew and more preparation for her bat mitzvah as well as a cultural education and i think chabad can accomplish that
8903858 we structure the lesson so children can actually relate to it
8903859 we bring it to their level with relevant personal examples and have them see things and hear things

8903869 there were two men in a certain city the one rich and the other poor 2 the rich man had very many flocks and herds 3 but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb which he had bought and he brought it up and it grew up with him and with his children it used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms and it was like a daughter to him 4 now there came a traveler to the rich man and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him but he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him
8903870 as the lord lives the man who has done this deserves to die 6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity
8903871 the lord also has put away your sin you shall not die 14 nevertheless because by this deed you have utterly scorned the lord the child who is born to you shall die

8903875 yet you say the way of the lord is not just
8903876 therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways declares the lord god repent and turn from all your transgressions lest iniquity be your ruin 31 cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel 32 for i have no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the lord god so turn and live

8903951 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8903952 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8903953 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8903954 dr martin luther king assassinated 1968 harold washington elected mayor of chicago 1983
8903955 barack obama elected president of the united states of america 2008
8903956 weve had disappointments since then but if someone told me i would be here
8903957 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8903958 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8903959 im looking for obama to offer a mantra or a symbol a connection that will easily identify his sense of hope
8903960 in the last eight years weve done some incredible things men and women of our country have done some incredible things

8903964 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8903965 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

8903972 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital
8903973 what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure that the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
8903974 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8903975 this leads to nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures by health care professionals developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8903976 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
8903977 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
8903978 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8903979 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8903980 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense it is not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory

8903983 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8903984 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8903985 are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
8903986 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics
8903987 we think that if we can embed these cues in control systems we can make following more reliable
8903988 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8903989 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8903990 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8903991 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8903992 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8903993 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8903994 since preterm infants continue to have significant cardiorespiratory events after discharge from the hospital our study may help identify the infants at risk for attenuated recovery from hypoxemic episodes while at home
8903995 furthermore it might help distinguish the infants who will arouse in response to hypoxemia
8903996 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8903997 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8903998 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses
8903999 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8904000 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8904001 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8904002 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8904003 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8904004 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8904005 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8904006 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8904007 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
8904008 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself
8904009 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8904010 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8904011 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8904012 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8904013 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8904014 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8904015 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8904016 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8904017 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8904018 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8904019 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8904020 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
8904021 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8904022 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8904023 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8904024 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8904025 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8904026 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8904027 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8904028 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8904029 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8904030 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8904031 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8904032 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8904033 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8904034 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further

8904043 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
8904044 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids
8904045 lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colours thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8904046 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire
8904047 weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done
8904048 but we are confident that the resources and policies now in place will deliver improved policing for scotland
8904049 but without scottish conservative pressure and insistence there would be no prospect of 1 000 more police no new national drugs strategy and no accelerated tax cuts for scotlands smallest businesses

8904055 we discount freddies presentation about how it can stay above regulatory capital minimums come hell or high water
8904056 weve obviously provided you with an extraordinary amount of information but im not going to apologize for that
8904057 as much information as you could possibly need to come to your own best view of what the future may hold
8904058 they were getting really lairy they talked all the way through and kept being told to shut up
8904059 but it really kicked off when a scene about russian immigrants flashed up
8904060 some people walked out in disgust and he was chucked out by the bouncers
8904061 i cried my eyelashes off i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8904062 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8904063 there has been a lot of talk about who is coming over from the u k
8904064 i think this album is more sophisticated than her first the writing production and her confidence has grown too overall she is a better artist
8904065 we were never the most proficient musicians when the band started pink floyd were unique in that they werent great blues players in fact we never did become that musically accomplished
8904066 i am writing all the time i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
8904067 we go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i want them to get to do the kind of things i didnt get to do so i fill them with a lot of enjoyment that way a lot of amusement you know
8904068 i have always loved showbusiness and have always enjoyed making people happy through that medium i love the celebration of music and dance and art i just love it
8904069 for years i tried to get producers to have vinny sell his hummer sports utility vehicle and buy a enviromentally friendly toyota prius then i realised this show is entertainment i know that entourage is often demeaning and crude but theres also a lot of social commentary
8904070 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
8904071 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
8904072 i dont have one a favourite rap song i dont need to listen to music that brings me down with negative thoughts i prefer to listen to music that makes me happy like my new album that lucky old sun which was inspired by mr louis armstrong
8904073 i still get it yeah im nervous as hell before each show and i hate that feeling i love performing but i dont like feeling scared its a crummy feeling
8904074 when im not working i want to be myself i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try to pretend in my own head that this isnt happening
8904075 i think a lot of actresses live in this cotton wool world but im very free spirited and i want to be able to live the life i do
8904076 i was well known before i had a film out but i dont court attention i dont go to other peoples premieres i havent been out to a club in london for years
8904077 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8904078 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8904079 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8904080 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases
8904081 we are very far from treatment but this is a big step
8904082 i havent been well since beijing and its gotten a lot worse since coming home
8904083 the relaxed group dont let email exert any pressure on their lives
8904084 they treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail ill fetch it ill deal with it in my own time
8904085 the second group felt driven to keep on top of email but also felt that they could cope with it the third group however reacted negatively to the pressure of email

8904105 day to day the nationwide average price of self serve regular gasoline is continuing to move lower
8904106 prices have been falling in reaction to the downward move in the crude oil price and because demand for gasoline among american motorists has been less this summer driving season than it was one year ago
8904107 the future price of gasoline will be heavily dependent up on the crude oil market
8904108 with oil representing about 75 of the price of gasoline one can see in the past several weeks as crude oil prices have dropped nearly 30 per barrel retail gasoline prices have dropped considerably
8904109 will be competing with one another as the year progresses

8904111 dont underestimate the potential negative impact of supplies and prices if gustav comes through the crude oil production and refining sector of the gulf
8904112 despite huge investor skepticism surrounding the dollars rally we think it was supported by clear fundamental factors was reasonable in magnitude and has more room to run
8904113 are expected to remain weak but part of this is probably priced in after the recent euro decline
8904114 on top of that the ecb still gives no sign at all that this slowdown is already enough of a reason for a rate cut
8904115 going forward we expect that inflation will continue to decline in the currency area and for the european central bank to adopt a more balanced stance to price pressures however given the banks track record in responding to inflation we do not believe that the 25 basis point increase in interest rates in july will be reversed quickly
8904116 ppr has always been able to take advantage of periods of slower growth and the present case is no exception

8904136 inflation has started to slow but remains too high for the ecb to soften its rhetoric
8904137 is consistent with stagnation in the economy and a genuine risk of recession

8904142 was it a dream was it the dream of a somnambulist a dream within a dream and hence more real than a real dream since it cannot be measured against waking since it cannot be measured by consciousness because it is a dream from which one awakens into another dream or was it a god like dream a dream of time and eternity a dream without illusions and doubts a dream with its own languages and senses a dream of both soul and body a dream of consciousness and corporality both a dream with clear cut boundaries with its own language and sound a dream that is palpable that can be explored with taste smell and hearing a dream stronger than waking a dream such as only the dead perhaps can dream a dream that cannot be denied by a blade nicking the chin for blood flows at once and everything one does is but a proof of reality and waking the skin bleeds in the dream as does the heart the body rejoices in the dream as does the soul there are no miracles in the dream other than life the only way out of the dream is to awaken into death

8904155 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8904156 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8904157 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8904158 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8904159 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia

8904172 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either

8904208 in both cases the center started a war in kosovo and south ossetia as well as abkhazia but the conflicts were halted in different ways through the ruthless inhuman bombardment of belgrade in the case of kosovo and without punishing tbilisi for its attacks on sukhumi abkhazias capital
8904209 a ceasefire was agreed peacekeepers were deployed and mechanisms for talks established belgrade has never tried to use military force or cast doubt on negotiations since 1999 but they were destroyed by kosovo albanians supported by the west and it was tbilisi that undermined the settlement mechanisms in south ossetia and abkhazia

8904233 for too long we have relied on faith good fortune or flagellation for the education of our young
8904234 yet in todays world we have the tools at our disposal the data the recording systems the number crunching powers the analytical algorithms to replace intuition with evidence as the foundation of public policy and education management
8904235 what it takes is a determination to ask questions that probe deeper to examine the facts from new angles to be open to findings that will sometimes confound our preconceptions
8904236 our universities and research institutions are rightly at the forefront of analysis of south african demographic trends epidemiological patterns labour markets industrial processes mining technology
8904237 but there are areas of social enquiry in which we are not yet making anywhere near enough use of available data and analytical tools
8904238 my submission to you is that the best functioning universities and colleges in the 21st century will be those that make the most aggressive use of data data about what they do data about how their students do data that tracks student performance into the work place career development skills and earnings
8904239 we need more studies of classroom practices we need more analysis of learning outcomes we need tracer studies that follow students out of the classroom into their careers
8904240 if our schools and colleges are to play their role as an inter generational ladder out of poverty and if higher education is to play its role in technology change and supporting economic advancement then we need to continue to build more direct links between learning and doing
8904241 if we are to achieve growth of seven percent a year over the decade ahead what would that mean for our engineering and technology enrolment

8904328 theres been a popular misconception that the world can produce as much food as it likes well it obviously cant and asia cant feed itself at the moment
8904329 we need to give incentives to producers because people are buying and eating more
8904330 this is our opportunity to produce and export more and help to reduce hunger in the world
8904331 between 500 billion and a trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide each year
8904332 while some of you might be tempted to go all samurai on us for a couple of the bugs overall things went very very well
8904333 the government of car has not explained to us why the amending decree revoking our rights to minerals other than gold on the bambari 1 and 2 permits was necessary
8904334 we will allocate this rig to license partnerships in the future for exploration drilling on the ncs and consider this to be a major asset in our ongoing business development activities
8904335 the production level at the didon field has been satisfying since the start of didon 5 we therefore maintain the production forecast we presented in the financial report for the second quarter our estimate is that the average production in the group during the second half of 2008 will amount to between 16 000 and 21 000 barrels of oil per day
8904336 im hoping that itll firm it up and shape it up

8904340 the fact there has been something like 38 applications so far out of the 1000s of products on the uk market alone says a lot about this process

8904342 the european commission must conduct another review of the thmpd which fully reflects the impact of this over burdensome regulation to the sector

8904354 brechts socialist philosophy his thoughts about the poor man in this world seemed out of sync with our society and it seemed slightly hypocritical for me to present this play about desperately poor people poor in ways we dont really comprehend for audiences of rich people
8904355 we still are not poor in the same way with that kind of global depression and the absence of all jobs
8904356 yet i think the american landscape right now when we are seeing the instability of our financial institutions even if we are not quite ready to admit to the word recession has put the failures of our economic system on peoples minds a bit more
8904357 for any play to really work you have to speak to a modern audience though that doesnt mean you have to contemporize everything
8904358 costume designer alison siple and i were visually inspired by the 1920s and 30s but the homeless people will look more like now than then and while the setting will be a bit german it also will be nowhere and everywhere
8904359 i wanted the members of the audience to feel they were in a relaxed environment one where they could sit at a table and look at each other while also watching the performers
8904360 so our set designer lee keenan came up with the idea of two huge wooden table like platforms that can swivel around half the audience of about 100 will be be seated on those while the other half will be on traditional risers

8904469 rishi hein the hebrew school director is very progressive in her thinking and i really like the curriculum
8904470 i did take a look at other temples but i like their style they are going to connect content not just teach hebrew but teach the culture the history and incorporate it into real life
8904471 our goal is to educate jewish people as far as heritage our way of life and observance this is what we do and hebrew school is just another forum for doing that
8904472 the children who are currently enrolled happen to be affiliated with certain temples in the community
8904473 their parents just havent found a place for their child and maybe we are a better fit for their family or child were not here to take children out of other hebrew schools
8904474 its not as intensive we meet about once a month its not a hebrew program but more of a cultural education
8904475 we wanted tabetha to have more hebrew and more preparation for her bat mitzvah as well as a cultural education and i think chabad can accomplish that
8904476 we structure the lesson so children can actually relate to it
8904477 we bring it to their level with relevant personal examples and have them see things and hear things

8904481 car fuel efficiency is a simple effective and sustainable way to reduce europes climate changing emissions meps should listen to their constituents and vote for a regulation which is guaranteed to deliver a 25 per cent reduction in fuel consumption by 2012

8904539 obama appeared to achieve every goal the pundits and political backseat drivers had set out for him in advance he showed his heart emphasized the economy and most of all looked like a president

8904549 if theres anything i learned from my roots its trust the people
8904550 theyre a hell of a lot smarter than you think they are they know whats good for them they know whats good for the country and we dont seem to trust the folks but you know if you think about it thats what the obama campaigns all about
8904551 weve never been in a deeper hole internationally and ive never seen in five decades the american people the middle class so uncertain about their future and folks
8904552 we either fix it or we dont we change that direction or were not gonna fix it all but we change that direction or were gonna careen off the edge and its gonna be for the better part of a generation
8904553 joe bidens effort to create a record out of thin air for barack obama will not be enough to make up for barack obamas lack of experience lack of judgment and plans to raise taxes on the hard working families of pennsylvania
8904554 barack obama could have made that speech were he alive in 1972
8904555 no he was alive he was alive by the way if i hear one more time he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8904556 there was somewhere between six and ten busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down to wilmington del to the train station uh and i mean and there were there were hundreds of thousands of people

8904567 how many different ways can you sneak your own biases into a paragraph
8904568 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8904569 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
8904570 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8904571 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk
8904572 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama

8904579 like his friend paul robeson and others davis perceived the soviet union as a staunch foe of racism as he later put it in his memoirs and at one point he joined the communist party
8904580 by the time they obama and davis met davis had been out of politics for decades and mentor may exaggerate his role in the young mans life still its clear that obama did seek advice from the old man and that what he got was undiluted

8904660 die politik hat wort gehalten und die verhandlungsf hrer von kassen und kbv zu einer tragf higen l sung stimuliert
8904661 es wurde h chste zeit dass die niedergelassenen rzte mehr geld bekommen dies ist der ersatz f r zehn jahre stillstand in deren honorarstruktur

8904667 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
8904668 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
8904669 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
8904670 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
8904671 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
8904672 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
8904673 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
8904674 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
8904675 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
8904676 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
8904677 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
8904678 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
8904679 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
8904680 we want a change that is going to help us all
8904681 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
8904682 a body immersed in a liquid is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the water it displaces
8904683 this election has never been about me its about you
8904684 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8904685 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8904686 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
8904687 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
8904688 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
8904689 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8904690 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8904691 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8904692 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8904693 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8904694 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8904695 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8904696 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8904697 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
8904698 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
8904699 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
8904700 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
8904701 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8904702 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
8904703 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8904704 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
8904705 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
8904706 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8904707 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
8904708 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
8904709 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8904710 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8904711 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8904712 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8904713 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8904714 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8904715 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8904716 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8904717 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8904718 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8904719 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
8904720 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8904721 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8904722 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8904723 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8904724 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8904725 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8904726 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8904727 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8904728 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8904729 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8904730 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8904731 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8904732 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
8904733 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
8904734 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
8904735 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
8904736 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
8904737 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8904738 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8904739 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8904740 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8904741 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8904742 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8904743 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8904744 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8904745 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8904746 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8904747 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8904748 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8904749 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
8904750 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
8904751 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
8904752 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
8904753 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
8904754 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8904755 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8904756 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8904757 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8904758 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8904759 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8904760 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8904761 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8904762 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8904763 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8904764 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8904765 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8904766 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8904767 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8904768 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8904769 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
8904770 sen obama this is truly a good day for america how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8904771 the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin
8904772 in the meantime while on the look out ill be hoping for a more compassionate government from the next president
8904773 i dont know what i despise more ageism of all kinds
8904774 because you must be 18 to enlist 18 is a suitable minimum voting age
8904775 also i assume a president can exercise compassion without defying the constitution
8904776 gee why do we let them vote shouldnt we screen the registration system so only the intelligent and deserving dont worry john im sure youd make the cut are able to cast ballots
8904777 first of all your little plan of only letting smart educated people vote is going to backfire since polls show that more educated people overwhelmingly back obama
8904778 shame on you for assuming that younger people dont take the time to learn the issues and are just swayed by a charismatic man and shame on you for thinking you are better than us just because you are older and here i was always taught we were all created equal
8904779 only a moron would utter such words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
8904780 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8904781 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8904782 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8904783 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8904784 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8904785 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8904786 valign center height 57 gt i have a new email address
8904787 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8904788 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8904789 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8904790 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8904791 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8904792 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
8904793 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
8904794 the american people think if the latest luntz poll is to be believed that the institutions of the republic are failing that the government mainly the executive branch which was suppose to serve them no longer does
8904795 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8904796 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8904797 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
8904798 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8904799 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8904800 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8904801 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
8904802 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8904803 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8904804 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8904805 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8904806 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8904807 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8904808 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8904809 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
8904810 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8904811 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8904812 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8904813 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8904814 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8904815 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8904816 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8904817 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8904818 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8904819 seguimos em uma fase de di logo com moscou n o em uma fase de san es
8904820 alguns pa ses europeus propor o san es mas outros as rejeitar o
8904821 just three months after announcing our greenfield projects in goias land prices in that region had risen almost 40 percent
8904822 today we have some interesting prospects in terms of mill acquisitions that would cost less than the greenfield projects
8904823 senza timori e reticenze mai cedendo ai condizionamenti del mondo
8904824 nella storia della chiesa afferma benedetto xvi non mancher mai la persecuzione
8904825 proprio la persecuzione diventa fonte di missione di nuovi cristiani
8904826 da autentico profeta giovanni rese testimonianza alla verit senza compromessi
8904827 tutti coloro che seguendo il suo esempio introducono nel mondo la giustizia del regno di dio
8904828 con speciale vicinanza spirituale penso anche a quei cattolici che mantengono la propria fedelt alla sede di pietro senza cedere a compromessi a volte anche a prezzo di gravi sofferenze
8904829 il martire cristiano attualizza la vittoria dellamore sullodio e sulla morte
8904830 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8904831 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8904832 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8904833 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8904834 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8904835 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8904836 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8904837 john mccain will pay hundreds of dollars for his own shoes but were the ones who have to pay for his flip flops
8904838 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8904839 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8904840 what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8904841 the idea that were responsible for ourselves but we also rise and fall as a nation
8904842 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8904843 he took the last 8 years of the bush administration and said enough
8904844 i thought it was riveting i thought it was stunning he really did a fine job
8904845 he did everything he was supposed to do it was really inspiring
8904846 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8904847 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8904848 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8904849 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8904850 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8904851 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8904852 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8904853 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8904854 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8904855 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8904856 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8904857 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8904858 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8904859 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8904860 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8904861 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8904862 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8904863 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8904864 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8904865 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8904866 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8904867 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8904868 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8904869 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8904870 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8904871 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8904872 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8904873 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8904874 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8904875 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8904876 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8904877 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8904878 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8904879 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8904880 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8904881 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8904882 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8904883 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8904884 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8904885 i wish i had know this before we had three
8904886 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8904887 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8904888 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8904889 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8904890 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8904891 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8904892 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8904893 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8904894 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8904895 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8904896 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8904897 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8904898 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8904899 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8904900 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8904901 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8904902 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8904903 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8904904 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8904905 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8904906 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8904907 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
8904908 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8904909 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8904910 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
8904911 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8904912 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
8904913 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
8904914 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
8904915 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8904916 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8904917 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8904918 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8904919 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8904920 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8904921 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8904922 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
8904923 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
8904924 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8904925 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports

8904932 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8904933 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8904934 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8904935 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8904936 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8904937 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8904938 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8904939 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8904940 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8904941 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8904942 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8904943 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8904944 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8904945 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8904946 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8904947 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8904948 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8904949 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8904950 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8904951 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8904952 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8904953 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8904954 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8904955 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8904956 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8904957 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8904958 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8904959 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8904960 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8904961 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8904962 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8904963 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8904964 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8904965 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8904966 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8904967 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8904968 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8904969 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8904970 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8904971 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8904972 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8904973 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8904974 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8904975 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8904976 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm

8904978 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8904979 taking a cue from the work of karl popper a highly regarded philosopher friedman argued that the best test of a model is to compare its predictions with actual outcomes to this end it was defensible to construct a model on the basis of simplifying assumptions
8904980 investors will do well in the coming years if they remain anchored by the secular themes described earlier in this book having specified their expected return target and their risk tolerance they must adequately design and execute the three basic steps of portfolio management choosing the right asset allocation finding the best implementation vehicles and conducting risk management
8904981 many sophisticated investors have found that a disciplined approach to asset allocation provides structure that performs an important anchoring function such anchoring facilitates constructive outcomes and makes destructive outcomes less likely
8904982 close observers can say that the real secret to yales remarkable success is defense defense defense but how you might ask can defense be so important to yales remarkably positive results starting with that great truism of long term success in investing if investors could just eliminate their larger losses the good results would take care of themselves we remind ourselves of the great advantages of staying out of trouble yales rigorous defense in investing combines a series of rational initiatives rooted in the powerful body of investment theory developed at yale and other universities the architecture of yales portfolio structure is designed to locate the endowment portfolio on the efficient frontier in trade off between risk and return
8904983 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8904984 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8904985 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8904986 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8904987 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8904988 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8904989 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8904990 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8904991 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8904992 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8904993 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8904994 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8904995 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8904996 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8904997 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8904998 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8904999 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8905000 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8905001 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8905002 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8905003 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8905004 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads

8905015 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
8905016 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers baa would have known about this in good time and they didnt let us know
8905017 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
8905018 i asked for their attention and belted it out in my best theatrical voice i told them they were all famous they were being reported on the news we came out and the media was waiting for us so they knew everybody but us knew

8905026 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8905027 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8905028 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8905029 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8905030 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8905031 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8905032 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8905033 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8905034 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8905035 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8905036 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8905037 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong

8905049 the pc revolution was launched with pcs that invited innovation by others so too with the internet both were generative they were designed to accept any contribution that followed a basic set of rules either coded for a particular operating system or respecting the protocols of the internet both overwhelmed their respective proprietary non generative competitors such as the makers of stand alone word processors and proprietary online services like compuserve and aol but the future unfolding right now is very different from this past the future is not one of generative pcs attached to a generative network it is instead one of sterile appliances tethered to a network of control
8905050 it is certainly understandable that google in choosing to make a generative service out of something in which it has invested heavily would want to control it but this puts within the control of google and anyone who can regulate google all downstream uses of google maps and maps in general to the extent that google maps popularity means other mapping services will fail or never be built

8905058 we have the strongest squad in my time as manager at old trafford and whats more its going to get even stronger as we have a pool of players with time on their side some of them are so young that at times ive wondered how they have delivered such a technically high level of football but the best is yet to come because so many of them have not yet reached their football maturity i am thrilled to be in on the start of their great adventure
8905059 is to broaden the issues christians pay attention to and also to counter falsehoods or smears targeting senator obama the pac is sponsoring radio and television advertisements aimed specifically at christians mostly on christian radio in key swing states there are ads in religious publications as well
8905060 people like myself get a lot of attention when we talk about issues like abortion and family life but not when we talk about helping low income people
8905061 matthew 25 gives us the opportunity to try to get candidates to focus on these concerns
8905062 says he found his christian faith while working as a community organizer among low income people in a catholic sponsored program

8905232 the icc is having a meeting on september 11 and 12 to decide the best dates for the tournament when it is held next year but the final decision on whether it will remain in pakistan will be taken in march
8905233 the icc member countries have basically decided to wait and see if the situation changes in pakistan in the next six months and if this happens then the champions trophy would remain with us
8905234 there will be some changes in the ftp as the champions trophy where ever it is held will take three weeks for which all teams must be available
8905235 but we and india threatened to boycott the event if any hasty decision was made after which it was decided to adopt a wait and see policy until next march
8905236 the indian teams tour to pakistan from early january will be used to make assessments about the security situation in pakistan
8905237 i was watching their hand especially murali and mendis my plan was that if i can read their hand i can play well that was the gameplan
8905238 since we had lost the final of the asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka we put up a good show here
8905239 i am getting into a good shape now and all thanks to the people who gave me support like our coaches robin singh gary kirsten venkatesh prasad and others we had lots of good practice sessions in sri lanka and pakistan so we have come up with a good team now hopefully we will maintain the same intensity in international matches
8905240 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems as if these players just dont understand the problems being faced by us
8905241 we are trying to play cricket anywhere if we organise a tournament in pakistan india west indies and sri lanka will be available to tour as they said they had no issues on playing in pakistan
8905242 india is coming to play in pakistan in january and want their players to rest due to the postponement of the ct so
8905243 we still have sri lanka as an option but we have asked a couple of nations to invite us in writing
8905244 we have received favourable response from one of these nations and we are awaiting the response of their sponsors for a one day series it can be a bilateral series a tri nation or even a quadrangular we dont know but we are hopeful of getting cricket next month
8905245 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
8905246 i think even these players know they cant afford to offend the indians because all the money now is coming from india i would also love to see graeme smiths response if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
8905247 but we want the betterment and promotion of cricket and we want to move forward but for that the other countries must cooperate with us

8905301 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8905302 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8905303 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8905304 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8905305 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8905306 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8905317 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8905318 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8905319 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8905320 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8905349 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

8905511 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people
8905512 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8905513 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs

8905539 the director of phuket international airport decided to temporarily shut down the airport because protesters have trespassed on the parking spots and blocked the runways
8905540 the phuket governor is trying to negotiate with protesters now
8905541 the authority shut down both hat yai and krabi airports soon after phuket was closed because officials are unable to operate
8905542 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8905543 we call on our members from every department to exercise their right to take two days sick leave without a doctors certificate because this morning the government attacked people
8905544 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8905545 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8905546 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
8905547 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
8905548 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house
8905549 we will not let anyone control our fate we will write our fate on our own
8905550 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8905551 this is not a social dinner this is a working dinner
8905552 as children are the true essence of our future the importance of providing them with the most basic right of having a safe and happy childhood can not be underestimated
8905553 its just wonderful to have this new connection between the scandinavian countries and australia
8905554 the new problem of cyber bullying has become something of an epidemic
8905555 it requires therefore all of us at the level of being parents at the level of community leadership at the level of political leadership to work together against a problem which now knows no geographic frontiers
8905556 the fact you have turned tragedy into opportunity says so much about you
8905557 it was really exciting and i was a bit nervous when i gave her the certificate
8905558 i am delighted to have had the opportunity to find out more about how the alannah and madeline foundation initiative works and to talk about our programs at the mary foundation
8905559 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8905560 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8905561 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8905562 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8905563 you know passions may fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers but this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8905564 were very encouraged by the progress weve made over the past fiscal year
8905565 weve achieved significant bookings and backlog growth which positions us well as we enter fiscal 2009 to execute on the second year of our three year plan to achieve a profitable operating structure with our new products and services weve seen acceptance of our solutions across all targeted technical and commercial environments
8905566 we are pleased with bookings performance year over year as a leading indicator of the markets acceptance of our solutions
8905567 our fiscal 2008 financial goals were to generate double digit bookings growth stabilize revenue and manage cash and expenses we largely achieved these goals particularly through the growth in our core products bookings although the timing of customer acceptances did impact revenue for the year
8905568 these new products have allowed us to capture some of the worlds most coveted hpc wins while placing us in new accounts like a major online trading community
8905569 developments like these give us great confidence about the validity of our strategy and direction
8905570 i look forward to continuing to work closely with management and my fellow board members
8905571 i am pleased to have worked with the company during this transition and i have confidence in bo and tony in leading sgi forward

8905575 the cpm does not want india to go for the nuclear deal but they do not have any objection to china going for the deal can they not be called agents
8905576 the cpm has opposed india signing the gatt treaty and inclusion in the wto now even china has entered wto and wants most favoured nation status from the us
8905577 does the deal mean that we cannot make nuclear bombs the answer is we can no one can influence our military strategy the only condition is that we cannot send our reactors to any other country
8905578 during the chinese aggression in 1962 the communists did not even acknowledge it as an aggression when india fought with pakistan in 1971 to free pro liberation leader mujibur rahman and to create bangladesh the communists had no role in it
8905579 weve lost our homes weve lost our clothes weve lost everything
8905580 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
8905581 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
8905582 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
8905583 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
8905584 the camps are not organized yet and we are receiving reports of diseases

8905589 essa bola est com eles eles ainda n o apresentaram o que foi solicitado
8905590 we did away with the static html site and said heres the wiki
8905591 the success of that site is the narrow topic focus
8905592 trying to build a big all purpose wiki site is hard to make successful
8905593 all of our templates were created with the help of teachers from around the world
8905594 they increase student engagement and participation and they facilitate communication between teachers and parents and guardians
8905595 within each group tasks can be divided up one person can edit one person can hunt for information one person can draft copy etc
8905596 it turns the online course into something that has a permanent component
8905597 but in the online collaboration model you have something that lives on
8905598 i am thinking about buying an iphone but i have been hearing reports about its unreliability should i be worried should i wait for the problems to be fixed before i purchase an iphone should i not get an iphone at all
8905599 i like the iphone for its touch screen interface and for the fact that i can combine my ipod and my mobile phone into one device i even like that i can use an app like maps occasionally but thats it mainly i want a mobile phone that i can depend on for making and receiving calls without having to jump through hoops or read hundreds of pages of documentation
8905600 theyre giving them unique offers they wouldnt have had otherwise
8905601 so the consumer is smiling as theyre getting out because theyre redeeming an average of two offers per trip
8905602 the consumer is now buying more because theyre getting relevant offers that encourage them to buy what they might not have bought otherwise
8905603 ive seen this technology come up in the past i dont know whether it was the technology or usability but it drove customers out of the stores
8905604 things like this need to be extremely easy to use
8905605 we dummied it down to make it easier to save time
8905606 it was too complex before too powerful therefore it was not adopted
8905607 we do have in some stores kind of in the area of natural foods some tv screens that talk about eating properly and things like that
8905608 there are some mommy tips but thats just hit or miss and not in many stores
8905609 you can get an overall snapshot and it will tell you if youre high or low on specific nutritional attributes
8905610 for instance it will tell you if it looks like youre consuming too much sodium
8905611 you can drill down to figure out what youve purchased
8905612 if youre looking for cereal thats low in sugar and high in fiber it will help you find that with foodflex initially when you sign up you provide certain information about your family how many people matters in calculating what youre buying
8905613 the first challenge was crossing the chasm getting over the big hurdle of having one retailer spend millions of dollars in putting it into hundreds of stores
8905614 seeing that the benefits are real theyre now expanding the program and stop amp shop will roll it out to more stores
8905615 in malaysian politics you have the both the bn and opposition parties controlling 30 of the hardcore base vote and the 40 in the middle will determine victory and in permatang pauh he anwar solidly captured 70
8905616 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
8905617 with regards to why anwar gained chinese support despite a bn candidate fluent in chinese the chinese saw the message over the candidate bn tried to play a divide and rule game by portraying datuk arif shah omar shah as a pro chinese candidate on one hand while attacking anwar as a malay traitor
8905618 so no matter how proficient arif shah was at hokkien or mandarin it would not have helped
8905619 anwar has been consistent in his message for change to free the country from racial politics and corruption and that message has gone down well across communities the key factor was that people were frustrated with the status quo with bn politics and just wanted a change
8905620 no one believes in bn like they did before and there is a lack of trust in bn leaders umno has remained in a state of denial since march 8
8905621 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media they are insulting the intellectual voters by trying to use the media to play up their stories the bn governments thinking gap is far from the peoples their campaign strategy is a failure it is too out dated and it is just not working
8905622 the people want something but the bn gives a different thing those who believed that the bn government would do something to change their lives are probab y upset
8905623 the ruling party could not answer or respond to all the questions put forth by opposition leaders anwars promise of a new hope for malaysia has somehow convinced many even some strong bn supporters
8905624 bn has also lost the confidence of the malays and non malays especially among the middle class group it failed to understand the peoples grievances and that is how they become silent voters
8905625 i am not denying that the bn government has contributed a lot in the past
8905626 we should join with semper vita as a church pastor
8905627 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night then realised wed have to come back this morning it has not been very well handled
8905628 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
8905629 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers baa would have known about this in good time and they didnt let us know
8905630 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
8905631 i asked for their attention and belted it out in my best theatrical voice i told them they were all famous they were being reported on the news we came out and the media was waiting for us so they knew everybody but us knew
8905632 i take a lot of pride in what i am
8905633 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8905634 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8905635 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8905636 people should be confident they have not been exposed to highly dangerous chemicals
8905637 hey its labour day and you always want a crack at edmonton
8905638 ive been around long enough to know that this is a big game and it has absolutely nothing to do with the last game
8905639 when youre playing for the stampeders and youre playing against edmonton its always a big one its a big rivalry not too many of our guys know about it because we have such a young team so ive been trying to harp on that all week
8905640 ive been telling them its like a big college game down south theres going to be a lot of hype around here a lot going on and you have to be ready for it and not let the hoopla get to you
8905641 there was a lot of mistakes we made at the last moment but we cant dwell on that we just have to execute the things we didnt execute in the first game
8905642 its going to be a dogfight thats all i can say
8905643 you cant have him standing back there all day because hes going to pick you apart
8905644 but im sure our coaches have come up with some different schemes to get some pressure on him
8905645 ray has a lot of weapons they had a lot of guys doing a good job before tucker got hurt and theyve had a lot of guys step up and gotten better so you cant just focus on one guy you have to shut down their entire offence
8905646 we cant fear ray but we have respect for him
8905647 that first game we came up short on the play that ended the game so we have to bring our best to pull it off
8905648 we have to stick to the game plan run our schemes and i think well be all right
8905649 for the past year ive been working on a volunteer project that has been an endless source of frustration
8905650 24 hour turnaround itll take me an hour to fix afterwards email me i answer my emails in one hour tops

8905713 el gobierno del psoe lleva casi cinco a os gobernando en espa a y por tanto tiene una tremenda responsabilidad sobre la situaci n econ mica que hoy tenemos

8905725 theyre more or less fighting for market share at this point
8905726 one of the classic examples of that would be the pepsi challenge
8905727 from my perspective this is the way that gsk has always kind of handled things in the past
8905728 their modus operandi is always kind of to bash the competition and they do that in a number of ways
8905729 running jaws ads is just going to raise the anxiety level very high for people nervous about getting treatment this could put them over the edge
8905730 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8905731 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8905732 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8905733 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8905734 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8905735 in psychodrama participants explore internal conflicts through acting out their emotions and interpersonal interactions on stage
8905736 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation

8905744 then all of a sudden they decide lets just go to the same school sally goes to it makes our job a little more difficult
8905745 theres such a strong collegial relationship with superintendents of school corporations that i dont think that will take place
8905746 we dont want to get into a stealing students kind of mode
8905747 i know ips is trying really hard to make a lot of changes
8905748 but the people who end up getting left behind are the students who achieve really well
8905749 what will happen is only students with families that can provide transportation which is huge will be even able to take advantage of that
8905750 we want to make sure that we dont overextend ourselves
8905751 the 140 number is easy for us to manage weve done it for years if its much more well have to go to plan b
8905752 i feel like i just hit the lottery and didnt have to buy a ticket
8905753 its all about opportunity and being able to choose and pick the best choice i honestly look at it as what a phenomenal opportunity for those who may not have the financial capability to pay private tuition
8905754 the more important concept is parents have a choice and then they have a greater commitment to that whole exercise because theyve made a choice
8905755 it would be so good for the public schools and the parents and the kids its the right thing to do
8905756 thats just the new normal and people dont like the new normal
8905757 theres just a lot of bad news out there and the workplace is just one of the weak spots

8905760 the director of phuket international airport decided to temporarily shut down the airport because protesters have trespassed on the parking spots and blocked the runways
8905761 the phuket governor is trying to negotiate with protesters now
8905762 the authority shut down both hat yai and krabi airports soon after phuket was closed because officials are unable to operate

8905766 for most workers the weekend is more endangered than some california condors we check our email six times a day we own enormous homes that need to be repaired and remodeled we commute hours to work and hours back home we live in an age that has subsumed the human spirit and all its social spaces and work and leisure time to the imperatives of alienated work without end
8905767 the hourly rates of the countrys top lawyers are increasingly coming with something new a comma a few attorneys crossed into 1 000 per hour billing before this year but recent moves to the four figure mark in new york which sets trends for legal markets around the country are seen as a significant turning point on sept 1 new yorks simpson thacher amp bartlett llp will raise its top rate to more than 1 000 from 950 firm partner barry ostrager a litigator says he will be one of the firms thousand dollar billers along with private equity specialist richard beattie and antitrust lawyer kevin arquit the top biller at new yorks cadwalader wickersham amp taft llp hit 1 000 per hour earlier this year at fried frank harris shriver amp jacobson llp also of new york bankruptcy attorney brad scheler now at 995 per hour will likely soon charge 1 000
8905768 lawyers who bill by the hour typically spend their time thinking about hours rather than results few hourly billing attorneys tell their client what they will be delivering and the costs upfront once deliverables are defined a value billing attorney simply asks himself herself the same question each moment of each day how do i deliver the deliverables i have promised the client instead of cases just meandering forward each day the lawyers required to think strategically the lawyer has tremendous incentive to achieve that result sooner rather than later this is because hours of time now count against him her in contrast to the hourly billing approach where hours count against the client
8905769 many firms are actively thinning the ranks of equity partners
8905770 partners have given away almost all their rights running the firm is delegated to a committee which runs the firm like a business underperforming partners are given a warning and then shown the door
8905771 the eeoc has been watching this the agencys position often is that so called partners have ceded so many rights that they are really employees they are no longer partners the way they actually work on the ground
8905772 with overhead an associate costs a law firm double her salary thus an associate must bill 1 500 hours simply to pay for herself because not every hour can be billed that is about 1 800 hours of work six hours a day six days a week the rest of the day is the unpaid labor generating the surplus value value that the partners appropriate
8905773 in some ways this is reflective of the larger economy
8905774 older faculty appreciate loyalty and longevity our parents worked for the same companies all their lives i ask my mba students would they be interested in working for a company for 30 years and they laugh at me this may be true of newly minted ph d s as well
8905775 the decline of tenured faculty and the tenure system may not be such a bad thing there will be more mobility if tenure somehow went away thered be a lot of openings 20 25 percent might be forced out this would drive up wages it might be good for both individual institutions and for competent faculty
8905776 bad for the industry the benefits of tenure include shared governance without tenure all power would be transferred to the administration which is primarily interested in the short term while the tenured faculty tend to take the long view higher education would wind up with the same problems that plague corporations which quest only for short term profits
8905777 the broadest trend i see is how philanthropy is administered its all about accountability administrators turn to the for profit playbook an institutions biggest cost is people lots of institutions are aggressively paring down their people costs by cutting tenured faculty to the bare minimum the problem for administrators is that theres no comparable private sector playbook for managing tenured faculty tenure protects dead wood thats the terrible side of it administrators have to turn to the soft side in order to try to make these folks more productive
8905778 i certainly think i do have the best job in the legal world every day i wake up and thank god

8905820 banyak mereka pns red malah menduga keterlambatan pembayaran uang makan itu disebabkan belum disahkannya apbd labuhan batu oleh dprd padahal kan tidak begitu

8905886 redtag com a discount online retail site launches today with a us 1 95 shipping charge on all orders one of the lowest such rates in the industry
8905887 your competitor is only a click away and weve seen over the last four years that retailers have become very aggressive with shipping prices and used it as one of their most productive promotions i dont know that it will necessarily start a price war because its already extremely competitive
8905888 theres free shipping that a lot of retailers offer offers free shipping with a minimum 25 order
8905889 during the holiday season last year eight to 10 retailers were offering free shipping with no conditions or a minimum order size
8905890 free shipping or significantly discounted shipping costs the retailer money
8905891 im sure from a consumer perspective they still think gas is a major expense and theyre trying to reduce it any way they can
8905892 thats one of the reasons that the down economy has the effect of pushing people to shop online more than they did in the past
8905893 a lot of consumers tell us that one of the things that keeps them from making online purchases is fear of getting a big bill for shipping
8905894 we fixed the shipping price to eliminate that concern a price war is not our intent we spend our time making sure we have a good value equation for our customers we dont know how our competition will react
8905895 well make it up hopefully when customers come back to redtag com to buy more items thats why were willing to go low on the shipping because we want to earn the customers long term loyalty
8905896 redtag is smaller but its got some good relationships in place

8905932 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world set free because neosignal means no more compromise nobody to answer to a product a brand which is theirs from start to finish autonomy time to push boundaries
8905933 funked out rolling badness from phace this track is gonna be in my box for a long while to come its the perfect combination of a deep nasty dancefloor killer timeless
8905934 in his debut release for neosignal phace delivers another top of the range 12
8905935 probably my favourite track by phace evar a very untypical phace track one might say cause its so riff driven and progresses in a more subtle and dosed way than most genre counterparts it does things ive never heard a phace tune do before and yet still its undeniably phace but the most important reason why its such a standout tune is because its got so much heart so much more than most current techy d amp b its like hearing music youve been wanting to hear for a long time leaving you wondering why arent there more tracks like this and the answer is simple because magic like this doesnt happen often
8905936 neosignals first release brings the long awaited cold champagne rollers dont come much slicker than this phace bring the phunk with style once again killer every time and sick to mix massive support from the lifted camp
8905937 cold champagne brings back the phace funk from yesteryears a resurrected cut from their earlier days gets a face lift and delivers a tight blend of old phace with the new deep driving and introspective a must for any djs box whos willing to dig deeper
8905938 this is phace doing what they do best stomping driving twisting turning appealing to that part of your brain that only phace seem to know how to get to serious for me the best part about this tune is the fantastic switch from the brilliantly unusual levitating pad solo into a relentless persuasive groove that manages to breathe as much as it kicks and so the bar is set higher once again
8905939 we are really excited to finally see the mighty phace and misanthrop machine set free upon the world

8906132 the success of that site is the narrow topic focus

8906151 it would be silly not to use that sort of emotion for our benefit in this game
8906152 those three guys have been outstanding for this club and it would be sad to see them come off the field for the last time we have to make sure we play well and bring a bit happiness to the occasion as well

8906161 we are in a little bit of suspense on the market it could go either way
8906162 the only issue is youve had so much production taken out this year and that is going to come back into the market and at the same time youve got new production coming on
8906163 the shocking thing is even with all these cuts it still looks like a surplus market of 27 000 tonnes for this year

8906167 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8906168 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8906169 die arbeit im hostel ist einfach perfekt f r jemanden wie mich
8906170 ich lerne portugiesisch und andere sprachen finanziere meinen aufenthalt und meine studien hier habe einen platz zum schlafen und mache nebenbei eine weltreise in gewissem sinne
8906171 jeden tag sagen mir menschen mein gott hast du ein sch nes leben und sie haben recht
8906172 denn die stimmung im hostel ist einfach toll auf reisen ist jeder entspannter toleranter mehr dazu bereit etwas von sich zu geben
8906173 da hatte ich einfach keine zeit mehr f r mich und verga v llig wer ich bin
8906174 die arbeit bereichert mich hier kann ich mehr zu mir selbst finden ich treffe tolle leute lerne sprachen und viel ber die welt
8906175 ich habe diesen job vom ersten bis zum heutigen tag an geliebt
8906176 mein traum ist es irgendwann an einem anderen ort in den ich mich verliebe mein eigenes hostel aufzumachen
8906177 klar ist f r mich ich will weiter im hostel arbeiten ob als angestellte oder besitzerin das wei ich noch nicht
8906178 als schreiberling ist man ja sehr flexibel mit dem n tigen kapital passt da ein hostel in ungarn durchaus in meine pl ne und w re vielleicht auch eine gute inspirationsquelle f r meine romane
8906179 this concert was astonishing i went in expecting it to rock and to look cool but they went much further than that
8906180 during many sleepless nights i kept asking how is it that possible that we did this to each other
8906181 i have not found the answers but i know one thing if the truth cannot save us then really nothing can save us
8906182 because of those victims because of my conscience because of my life my child and my wife i cannot change what i said because of the peace of my mind my soul my honesty because of the victims and war and because of everything
8906183 i can only hope that by expressing the truth by admitting to my guilt and expressing remorse i can serve as an example to those who still mistakenly believe that such inhumane acts can ever be justified
8906184 i ask from my brothers croats to forgive us their brother serbs and i pray for the serb people to turn to the future
8906185 it is quite amazing those who confessed took this step
8906186 the accused not only had to come to terms with the crimes individually but it is also very courageous since they are themselves part of a criminal enterprise by apologizing they are thought of as traitors and this makes it difficult
8906187 when you are dealing with organized crime you need the assistance of the people most involved you have to penetrate the cabal but these people understand they are going to prison
8906188 those who confess have come to this by many ways but the intrinsic recognition of the criminal act is central to the truth telling and healing i cant say enough about that it is central to what the court does but it doesnt get attention
8906189 did not think anything particular would happen however thats not how it was
8906190 until the very last moment that i would be a member of a generation that would live its life in peace i had peaceful relations with my neighbors muslims and croats we lived together and socialized together and i even had girlfriends who were non serbs
8906191 radio television press everything was full of threats against serbs and against muslims
8906192 most of the people on trial are well educated with manners and families and who would not do these things in their daily lives
8906193 if my attempt to face myself contributes to the quicker healing of these wounds i will have done my duty as a soldier a fighter a human being and a father
8906194 i have now come to the belief and accept the fact that many thousands of innocent people were the victims of an organized systematic effort to remove muslims and croats from the territory claimed by serbs
8906195 if accountability is not present then the reconciliation would be a contradiction in terms i think systems of criminal justice exist not simply to determine guilt or innocence but also to contribute to a safe and peaceful society
8906196 you began to see that a lot of the question about who came to the hague was local politics
8906197 yes those indicted may have had a good case against them but you could see there were three or four around them who were zealots more responsible

8906203 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation

8906208 our study confirms that drivers in ireland still continue to use mobile phones whilst driving despite current legislation
8906209 in 2006 the number of registered motor vehicles in ireland was 2 261 466
8906210 if two million of these took to the roads every day our findings would suggest that in any one day up to 46 000 drivers would be driving while using handheld mobile phones

8906237 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8906238 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8906239 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8906240 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8906241 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8906242 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8906243 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8906244 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8906245 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8906246 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8906247 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

8906259 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it
8906260 these cinemas considering going popcorn free are creating a radically different model to any weve had before in the industry

8906298 we are extraordinarily proud of ann who has demonstrated over the years that she is truly a consummate golf professional
8906299 ann is recognized statewide and throughout the rocky mountain region as both a top notch instructor and a special person by her peers and students alike the country club of colorado and those who have benefited from her immense talent as a golf instructor have been very fortunate indeed
8906300 it was truly my love for kids and the enjoyment that i get working with children that provided the motivation to pursue teaching golf on a full time basis
8906301 if youre in a fight i want to kick them again i learned that when i used to be a boxer you dont want this guy coming back so when hes down kick him again
8906302 it is the best thing to have happened to half moon bay golf links and an incredible honor to host this event
8906303 to host an event where the most elite field in womens golf will be participating is amazing for us everyone is excited the news is shared with our guests and we cant wait for the event to arrive half moon bay is a special place and one that we get to share
8906304 the community is definitely looking forward to hosting this event and showing off their great town by the ocean the staff at half moon bay golf links is very excited to be hosting a world class event here at our facility
8906305 early on i attended a city merchants committee to give them an overview of the event and share how excited we were to host the tournament after the presentation every merchant asked what they could do already many of the stores on main street and in the strawflower shopping center have decorated their storefront windows in golf motifs to promote the event this is definitely a community affair that wants to welcome this event to a place that is warm friendly and energized to see world class golf in their backyard we cant wait to see the best in world play against the ocean
8906306 weather will be a large factor in deciding how the ladies score
8906307 the ocean course is a links style golf course with nothing to stop the wind if it blows in from off the ocean if it is blowing hard it will become the focal point playing 2 4 clubs different it will affect every part of the players game even the putting course setup will not change very much for the tournament we will pinch in a few fairways but it will play close to how it plays everyday
8906308 no 17 is a par three that plays along the bluff
8906309 if the wind is blowing it may be necessary to aim your shot out over the bluff and have the wind bring it back in spectacular views of the ocean and playing right up against the bluff make it a great hole
8906310 the other projects we are undertaking to enhance the course is extensive top dressing to speed up the greens and bunker refurbishment to provide championship conditions worthy of this remarkable field of players
8906311 as with links style courses they are a little more rustic so our focus is to make sure the bunker depth is consistent that the grasses are pristine and the course signage looks fresh and new
8906312 watching the worlds best of 2008 competing on the ocean course at half moon bay golf links makes for great sporting spectacle fabulous scenery fun and relaxation
8906313 golf and sports fans are ensured of witnessing the highest quality of golf here
8906314 our new burner plus irons possess one of the highest moi measurements of any taylormade iron making them super forgiving and easy to hit
8906315 these are so easy to launch that its a blast to make a big swing and let them fly we had a lot of fun designing them and are looking forward to the reception they receive among golfers who like to go long
8906316 we took special care to address a common problem thats plagued many of our competitors combo sets and thats the distance gap formed between the lowest iron and the highest hybrid
8906317 for example if you average 170 yards with your 5 iron and 190 yards with your 4 hybrid youve got a 20 yard gap between those clubs and thats a problem we avoided that issue by carefully configuring the two rescues in the burner plus combo set to deliver a distance increase thats consistent with the distance increase delivered from iron to iron from the lob wedge all the way up to the 5 iron thus if a players distance difference between each iron is 10 yards he can be confident that his rescue 4 will be 10 yards longer than his 5 iron and that his rescue 3 will be 10 yards longer than his rescue 4
8906318 my brothers and i are emotionally and financially invested in this vision of creating a golf destination and community unlike anything in this part of country
8906319 considering the economic times its a gamble for the developers
8906320 the thing that impressed me the most however is that they havent asked the state for anything theyre doing it all with their own money
8906321 it really says something about the quality of heron point by pete dye that in one short year enough industry insiders and course ranking panelists recognize the merits of heron point to place it in such a lofty position
8906322 this years best places to play rates nearly 6 000 courses in north america and the islands
8906323 the courses were evaluated by approximately 20 000 golf digest readers on a five point scale
8906324 pete dye returns to sea pines to make over heron point into a worthy complement to his breakthrough harbour town
8906325 pete dye returns to the sea pines resort to create his newest masterpiece
8906326 in a crowded marketplace where you have all kinds of competition around hilton head myrtle beach and charleston heron points entry in the state rankings says something for both the sea pines resort and for pete dye
8906327 its wonderful and refreshing to see that even as tastes have changed and hundreds of new wonderful golf courses have been added since harbour town was built harbour town maintains its status as one of the greatest courses in the country public or private people still recognize it for its merits even after years of changing tastes
8906328 we couldnt be happier with this kind of recognition especially coming from one of the premier golf magazines in the world golf magazine rankings have always been significant not just among insiders and travel aficionados but with the general golfing public they take the selection process seriously and the readers know that a golf magazine ranking means something special
8906329 more than anything were proud to have great golf courses that the public can play
8906330 too many great courses are private and inaccessible our goal at sea pines resort has always been to provide the quality and service you find at the best private clubs in a resort setting
8906331 these rankings are important because the majority of golf magazine readers the majority of golfers out there dont have access to private clubs especially top ranked private clubs that populate other lists our list is for everyone there are no barriers
8906332 to get in the tour championship would be a dream rookie season
8906333 images of a gentleman brings the world of golf through photography to those that enjoy the sport and have an appreciation of its traditions
8906334 gentleman jack has long been involved in golf often a favorite on the course or to toast the days winner we are proud to bring this evening to a passionate audience and to share with them a toast to the finer things in life
8906335 the images that were chosen to be featured in this series of engagements are among the most iconic in golf digests extensive collection
8906336 i cannot think of a better way to showcase these remarkable photographs than in conjunction with the prestige that is associated with the gentleman jack brand
8906337 mit ihrem illegalen verhalten haben sie die glaubw rdigkeit und den ruf der olympischen spiele verletzt
8906338 es sind zwar nur eine handvoll idioten aber so etwas darf es nicht geben
8906339 es hat mich aber irritiert dass die fans auch danach weiter sachen auf das spielfeld geworfen haben
8906340 man stellt sich nicht darauf ein dass man durch einen zuschauer verletzt wird
8906341 ich war immer einer der auf die fans zugegangen ist ich wei nicht genau wie ich damit umgehen soll
8906342 es kann zwei monate dauern oder auch zwei jahre manche werden nie geheilt ich setze auf den faktor zeit
8906343 ich habe mir noch keine gedanken gemacht wie ich jetzt reagieren werde
8906344 such a string of mishaps and missteps might throw another electronics company into crisis
8906345 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8906346 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things
8906347 as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
8906348 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
8906349 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

8906393 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8906394 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path

8906409 there have been far too many deaths related to the use of tasers
8906410 so if the police feel that they need more time to study this issue fine but in the interim rather than declare that tasers are an acceptable intermediate force option police forces across the country should impose a moratorium on their use until the report is released otherwise a cloud of doubt will continue to hang over the effectiveness of tasers
8906411 while further study into taser use is certainly needed a delay this long means that full police accountability of taser use will not be forthcoming
8906412 but withal if one is patient in adversity and forgives this behold is indeed something to set ones heart upon

8906437 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8906438 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8906439 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy

8906445 late on thursday manchester city told rcd espanyol that it was ready to pay the buy out clause for argentine pablo zabaleta

8906447 the package is aimed at getting voters attention in anticipation of the next election
8906448 its definitely positive but to what extent is the question
8906449 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8906450 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8906451 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions

8906454 they are hoping that economic data today confirms the idea from the gdp number that the economy may not slip into recession
8906455 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside
8906456 this is just sort of data that trickles out that can be very positive one day and negative the next we dont yet think it signals a trend
8906457 in the light of the turbulence in the banking and housing sectors the first six months of this year have been very challenging for b amp b
8906458 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy
8906459 to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year
8906460 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8906461 every chance you get you have to take advantage of it i had 36 35 chances combined rushes and receptions and i tried my best to take advantage every time i touched it
8906462 he had worked some there in camp but he really hadnt gotten very many reps inside there
8906463 i understand why he didnt want to play the starters
8906464 i wanted to play but its not a big deal i never really brought it up
8906465 weve got into this big debate about banning tasers in my experience conducted energy devices save lives its an intermediate tool that police officers should have available to them what we need to debate is the proper use of the tools and the accountability
8906466 we decided to pass it out to an independent body so that the work that comes back has all that scientific rigour and validity that goes into a peer reviewed document

8906475 you know for a place in the fourth round of the biggest tournament of the year
8906476 i think well probably put our friendship aside for a couple of hours

8906480 ive got a pretty big hurdle at the moment with james id like to think that he does as well
8906481 pressure is a synonym for opportunity without any pressure youre probably doing something a lot of people dont care about or youre doing something thats easy nothing im doing out there is easy and im proud to be in that position of having pressure
8906482 i am looking forward to finally getting a chance at being home
8906483 when its not funny but its supposed to be well be the guys laughing and supporting you
8906484 its kind of hard to take everything and to understand the experience that ive had
8906485 hopefully as time goes on ill be able to sit down and really think about the opportunities ive had
8906486 i thought i ran out of time i messed up

8906488 were looking forward to playing high quality opposition in preparation for next weeks start of the magners league

8906492 i dont realize yet that i beat the no 1 player in the world
8906493 i dont realize that i played at the big court i dont know how i am going to sleep tonight
8906494 because i was playing some tournament before i play in the states i wasnt playing that good and i was thinking am i really made to play tennis am i going to get in the top 100 one day because its not worth it to play tennis if youre not in the top 100 at one point i was thinking like to maybe stop at the end of this year
8906495 the adverse impact of the continued violence and intimidation of the work force of the nano plant is not restricted to singur or west bengal but will resonate in indias global image

8906724 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8906725 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8906726 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8906727 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8906728 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8906729 we still have a third world grid with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy

8906734 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8906735 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8906736 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8906737 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8906738 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8906739 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8906740 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8906741 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8906742 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways

8906747 this is a bill that is going to be subjugated to public consultation and i dont think there are reasons for this commotion
8906748 destabilizing the country playing with fear and keeping information from the venezuelan people
8906749 the publication yesterday monday in the newspaper el universal in which it as indicated that within the national assembly there is telecommunications bill up for quick approval is totally false we think that this has been written in a media campaign with a view towards the upcoming elections of 23 november trying to say that the national government seeks to monopolize the system of media of the country
8906750 its completely the opposite our vision is that every day we could have better utilization of the internet by the people and the citizens this is a very useful tool and it enables us to raise the level of knowledge of our people so for us its fundamental that this power reaches all sectors and its one of the aims of the new cantv and the ministry
8906751 obviously during that timeframe the fight in sadr city was a very kinetic fight
8906752 with the threat of these areas being lower and the ground guys focusing more on non lethal operations we of course conduct fewer lethal operations as well
8906753 if you look at the big picture the less we have to shoot and destroy targets or kill insurgents indicates that we are getting closer to mission success in iraq
8906754 the changing nature of our attack and reconnaissance missions reflects a greater level of security among the people a demonstrated capability of the iraqi police and army and a general improvement in the daily lives of the population this would not be possible without the continued efforts of our ground partners to transition security to the iraqis and aid in the economic development of their areas these positive trends have allowed us to provide a greater degree of overwatch and a reduced level of direct action
8906755 because of the progress of the iraqis and their ability to handle their own internal affairs with minimal coalition support the decision was made to minimize our presence around karbala
8906756 it bolsters the iraqis confidence not only the iraqi security forces confidence but the confidence of the iraqi population in the security forces ability to do its job

8906766 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8906767 they either had a meal here or live here and were walking to the trolley
8906768 theres not much to say other than we have to find out what happened
8906769 home prices are coming down in champaign county in time the multipliers wont be as big
8906770 have determined that the programming and services offered are not structured in a manner to support the needs of students with severe behavior issues
8906771 very early on we had taken the position that columbia could not be modified and needed to be closed it was a racially identifiable school
8906772 looking at the level of changes the complexity of changes recommended we collectively made the decision we didnt have the capacity to make the changes while we had a full school running
8906773 when i see the data that shows the attendance rates its obvious there needs to be a change made
8906774 i think theres a great opportunity to spend some time now and next semester to really take a close look at that program and programs like columbia to see what we can do
8906775 we are concerned that there be a sound educational program for kids
8906776 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8906777 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8906778 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8906779 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8906780 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8906781 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8906782 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8906783 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8906784 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8906785 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8906786 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8906787 while they now have the excuse of a slower economy to hide behind and they used it as such in their release results were weak
8906788 despite the weakness the company is clinging to the belief that its second half will be stronger helped by massive expense cuts and by pulling inventory lower we have seen this picture before and it is not a happy ending
8906789 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8906790 it seems even from their perspective its been a pretty rough year so far
8906791 but i think the sales environment is going to remain challenging through the remainder of the year and theyre going to continue to feel the pain particularly in accessories like appliances and tools that are directly related to home
8906792 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8906793 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8906794 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8906795 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8906796 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8906797 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8906798 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8906799 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8906800 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8906801 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8906802 if people start canceling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm were probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated
8906803 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8906804 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8906805 i understand people having wanting things to have happened yesterday i understand the anxiety of the people on the ground so there is frustration but i want people to know there is a lot of help coming
8906806 is that we waited for the government response and it never came my government is the first one there when anything happens in a foreign country and here they failed from the very beginning
8906807 we might take one calculated risk but we probably wont take two

8906919 one term thats sometimes used in the public relations trade to describe this is what they call the third party technique which is to put your clients message in someone elses mouth
8906920 one way to do that is to get your clients message in the news so that it looks like a news story another commonly used technique is the third party expert someone who is presented to the public as an independent expert on some issue such as tobacco and health or global warming or food safety or product safety and either not disclosing or generally downplaying and not mentioning the fact that this person has actually been recruited and often paid by the industry itself to deliver its talking points
8906921 in terms of how pervasive that is in society well studies have been done of newspapers and their contents that typically find that approximately half of the content of the daily newspaper originated with some pr firm in some fashion or another through news releases or other forms its really a strikingly high percentage of the information that the public gets as news thats actually something that started from someone deciding that they wanted to push that message out to the public
8906922 during the first world war woodrow wilson set up something called the committee for public information to mobilize support for the war effort and they invented a lot of the techniques that later got taken up by the pr industry
8906923 a number of the people who went on to become founders of the public relations industry worked for the committee for public information and after the war ended they realized that there was a market and money to be made by providing similar services to companies
8906924 one of the boldest and most extensive pr campaigns in history primarily financed by the energy industry and executed by some of the best pr talent in the world
8906925 clear the pr pollution that clouds the science of climate change
8906926 in this case all they were trying to do and they still do is try to create seeds of doubt
8906927 the goal is not to persuade persuasion is much more difficult to actually make people change the way they think or change the way they do things is much harder than just giving people a reason not to do something like be concerned about an issue
8906928 and doubt is very easy to create by creating a debate in the media around the science of climate change
8906929 which 10 years ago may have been somewhat legitimate but now were seeing not only the effect that the climate scientists were predicting were also seeing certainty levels higher than ever before and still the only scientific argument and i wouldnt even call it that id call it an argument is being played out against climate change in the media not in the scientific literature
8906930 its really started to move away from the denial of the climate science that has changed now to oh well its happening but its natural they dont actually have any science but they have their own opinions of that outside of that kind of argument thats really fringe just a few strange people who just cant let go or have been convinced by people who cant let go the argument is really moving towards the solution side of things and youre seeing industry and government coming in on that
8906931 so youre seeing arguments around the carbon tax of course stephen harper has been saying its going to kill the economy but he has no proof of that youre seeing arguments around why we shouldnt be doing renewable energy youre seeing dirty energy sources like the tar sands being spun to be environmentally friendly
8906932 language is something that of course is very important in framing issues for people and thats a term that a lot of pr people use in talking about how they use language framing quite a bit of effort goes into figuring out the right terminology to talk about issues
8906933 who can be against the idea of not leaving a child behind the very names of things become advertisements for them instead of descriptions as a result of these kinds of things
8906934 thats of course something george orwell talked about quite a bit in his book 1984 that if you can control the vocabulary people use to talk about things then you can control the way they think about them as well
8906935 where i have a problem with it is when pr works to conceal the relationship between the client and the message
8906936 usually when theyre doing that its because theres something about the message that is suspect i find that in general the worse the behaviour of the corporation the more likely they are to use suspect methods the more good a company is doing and the less harm the less need it has to resort to covert methods to get its message out
8906937 i think people do need to be careful about regulation because a lot of the techniques of public relations are really using communications tools that are guaranteed to everyone in a democracy and i think we do have to be careful about not restricting use of those tools in a way that would undermine democracy itself free speech is pretty important
8906938 people would do well to just generally have a careful attitude about information that they get from the media in particular to realize that the information may have an agenda behind it
8906939 simply realizing that will sometimes help in identifying who is the source of the message understanding the techniques used by the pr industry understanding that some of it is designed to look like independent news and approaching the information you get with something of a skeptical eye i think goes a fair way to helping people see whats going on
8906940 the best advice a good pr person can give is the first thing you have to do is do the right thing
8906941 no amount of greenwash no amount of public relations spin is going to help your company in the long term you will be found out just like the tobacco companies were start doing the right thing and start telling people youre doing the right not greenwashing if youre actually doing the right thing you can communicate that and you can communicate it well and people will believe it over time if you continue to prove that what youre saying is what youre actually doing thats how you build a good reputation
8906942 a sin and those who commit the act know that it is not right to kill particularly an innocent child
8906943 church law also dictates that whoever caused it abortion will be excommunicated
8906944 whether they are remnants of kuratong baleleng or ampang colangco group we still do not know
8906945 the gdp growth numbers are more or less in line with rbis expectations the economic advisory councils expectations and markets expectations and also given the probability of a surge of inflation being relatively low at this time

8906953 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8906954 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8906955 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8906956 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases
8906957 we are very far from treatment but this is a big step

8906995 es la primera vez que un tribunal de apelaci n estadounidense trata directamente asuntos sobre la fuerza ejecutiva de las licencias de c digo abierto
8906996 ya que los tribunales estadounidenses no encontrar n gu a alguna sobre este asunto se referir n a este caso y a su l gica para que hacer valer las condiciones de las licencias de c digo abierto
8906997 durante mucho mucho tiempo hemos estado esperando que se pronuncie un fallo sobre las licencias de c digo abierto
8906998 este suceso permite ver con m s claridad la manera en la que la ley estadounidense considerar estas licencias no tradicionales
8906999 a n as un futuro caso del circuito federal en este mbito del derecho deber basarse nuevamente en las normas jur dicas del noveno circuito y no en la interpretaci n del circuito federal
8907000 el razonamiento utilizado en este caso ser muy persuasivo para los tribunales en el futuro
8907001 para poder tomar una decisi n diferente los pr ximos tribunales se ver an obligados a distinguir los hechos
8907002 la decisi n tiene el peso del circuito federal que por lo general falla en casos de asuntos de tecnolog a
8907003 dado que la apreciaci n de los da os y perjuicios es intr nsecamente especulativa estos tipos de restricciones de la licencia podr an ser considerados sin efecto y podr a ser imposible exigir su cumplimiento mediante desagravio por mandato judicial
8907004 confirma las expectativas que tienen millones de cedentes de licencias de c digo abierto de que se trata de una manera leg tima y pr ctica de proteger las obras registradas como propiedad intelectual
8907005 la decisi n legitima estas licencias no se les da un estatus de segunda clase por el hecho de que sean obras dedicadas al p blico
8907006 ive been waiting for this time for a long time but its not like we won a super bowl

8907012 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family

8907014 we planned that way but it always could have been different were glad to have him and we think hell do a good job for us

8907016 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future

8907024 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8907025 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8907026 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8907027 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8907028 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter
8907029 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8907030 i just told him today youre the love of my life
8907031 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8907032 i didnt ever want to regret not ever dating anybody else because nick was you know he was the love of my life the you know the first guy that i really fell like head over heels i want to marry this guy you know i never really dated at all
8907033 the way to fix negative images of israel is to present israel in a positive light elsewhere
8907034 never has there been this scale of combination of business and philanthropy for israel
8907035 has placed more than 5 000 stories with positive images of israel and israelis in mainstream american media
8907036 tens of millions of eyes see israel21c reported stories yet most of them dont know that israel21c is the source
8907037 all the recent research on israels image or brand in america indicates that the one demographic group that has the least positive knowledge of israel in america is men under 30 to them israel is a place of armed military conflict and little else
8907038 we have to find the right hook and whats relevant to men under 35 good looking women
8907039 yo le digo con seguridad que nadie ha planteado la destituci n y claro hay preocupaci n de los acad micos no los disidentes no los rufianes en toda la discusi n nunca se habla de la parte acad mica que yo creo que es la m s importante
8907040 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture
8907041 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts
8907042 when the government realized that tens of thousands of people and activists can be rallied in a few days time using viral communication techniques available on facebook they started to monitor the social network more closely the word is that there is even a special division called the state security investigation police for facebook
8907043 whenever a formal economic social cultural or legal subsystem fails to deliver the basic needs of the people
8907044 remarkable genius in devising parallel sub systems to fill that gap hole or deficit
8907045 there is no freedom of expression and there is no real mass media where we can speak our opinions so we go to the internet to speak our opinions with more freedom and increased range
8907046 we cant replace the actual world of newspapers and political parties with the hypothetical world of the internet
8907047 there are a million users in egypt i dont think all those can adapt to a life without facebook
8907048 the government realizes this but they are trying until the last minute to slow the wheels of change forces of technology changing cultures changing modes of communication this is a phenomenon that no government or alliance of governments can block this is evolution and no one can stop evolution

8907086 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
8907087 burning and looting of ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia
8907088 all of this adds up to compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses
8907089 this should persuade the russian government it needs to prosecute those responsible for these crimes
8907090 the ossetians had cars outside and first looted everything they liked then they brought hay put it in the house and ignited it the house was burned in front of my eyes

8907097 theres no reason for conservatives to be torn between indifference and acquiescence on one of the most important domestic issues of our time
8907098 it is important for conservatives to point out that far from having a free market america is a nation whose health care system is suffering from ham handed government intrusions into the free market
8907099 levitra has always worked great for me and ive been getting it from your company for two years i dont have time to go to the pharmacy so its better for me to work with an online drugstore i referred a couple friends to you but i dont know if they called guys usually dont talk a lot about that stuff if you know what i mean but the product is great and your company is great

8907101 i plan to order from you for as long as i can see its great to be able to buy levitra online for erectile dysfunction your company provides a great service and as far as i can tell ill need this drug forever so i might as well keep it simple and stick with you
8907102 ive had nothing but good experiences with levitra and with your company it works for me every time and your service has been prompt and professional
8907103 i couldnt believe i even needed levitra to begin with and i didnt know anything about erectile dysfunction but for the past year ive been getting it from your online drugstore since i live in a small town and i didnt want to run into one of my friends or relatives at the pharmacy great product great company great service thanks
8907104 i wasnt about to do this on my own but my wife finally made me check out some levitra online from your company a couple years ago its absolutely changed our life together your company is always prompt and professional and levitra works every time thank you

8907109 for us there is no substitute for the multilateral system
8907110 to conclude the negotiating phase of the round this year
8907111 i think its possible but it requires hard political decisions and it has to be very fast
8907112 if there is a good agreement that everyone else will commit to then the next president will also agree
8907113 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
8907114 i will be guided by what they want right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side

8907119 with 2012 now on the horizon we thought it timely for the uk and australia to network as the big build begins for the london games and beijing is the perfect place to showcase our expertise
8907120 the goal of our recapitalisation effort is to reduce debt levels and extend remaining debt maturities through asset sales and new equity investment
8907121 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8907122 its a good operating company and should get itself out of this capitalisation issue
8907123 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit
8907124 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8907125 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8907126 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
8907127 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8907128 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points
8907129 the ubiquitous use of debt is a thing of the past

8907132 a failure of us mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac could be a catastrophe for the global financial system
8907133 if the us government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
8907134 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system

8907163 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8907164 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8907165 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8907166 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
8907167 we are disappointed by the courts decision and will appeal this ruling

8907179 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to pakistan the united states and the entire world
8907180 many others have been injured and we expect casualties to rise
8907181 those who were left alive were in great suffering i saw a man clutching his leg and crying in pain and asking for help
8907182 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
8907183 presidency is the right of our party and that is why party lawmakers asked zardari to run for this post
8907184 the militants had established their command and control system in the thickly populated areas with an intention to use the civilian population as human shield we are leaving no stone unturned to avoid the civilian casualties in the operation and advance it in a systematic manner we have inflicted considerable damage on their command and control system and according to our information 45 50 hardcore militants including a leading commander have been killed
8907185 we enjoy the support of the people but i still urge them to pick up arms against the militants and dont allow them to hide among them
8907186 these displaced people are in urgent need of basic necessities such as food clean water and shelter
8907187 lack of medical care is a problem for sick people particularly children
8907188 we have credible information about the killing of 10 15 foreign militants out of the 45 killed on saturday
8907189 we have not found the bodies of the foreign militants but intercepts provided us sufficient evidence that they were foreign militants
8907190 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
8907191 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving
8907192 i believe he is the most suitable candidate he is the one who refused to take an oath under musharrafs rule
8907193 this is a great pakistani his service to this country is unmatched
8907194 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
8907195 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
8907196 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
8907197 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
8907198 six policemen and a civilian have been killed the prison bus was on its way to the jail to pick up prisoners for their court hearings
8907199 near the bridge on kurram river an explosive laden vehicle was already parked when the bus approached the vehicle the explosives were detonated by a remote control
8907200 we do see more foreign fighters now though i think coming to pakistan and operating in afghanistan than were seeing in iraq no intelligence agency would say this but it may be that theres been a refocus i think the al qaida knows that they have blown a movement in iraq through a number of missteps over time
8907201 the influence and the presence and the numbers of al qaida in iraq are very much diminished and they had to go somewhere and my guess is my belief is that they probably have gone to that safe haven in the fata
8907202 look at these people they want her this should be her convention

8907216 the cap prides itself on providing pathologists with the highest caliber of timely practical continuing medical education therefore recognition of our efforts by an external accrediting body is most encouraging
8907217 we are very proud of having attained this level of recognition
8907218 as our goal is to help our members excel in all areas of laboratory medicine and ensure the highest caliber of patient care this award certainly attests to the effectiveness of our efforts
8907219 was the center of the greater new orleans safety net system for the past 269 years and the dominant source of care for the indigent population serving 63 percent of the uninsured
8907220 katrina revealed some ugly truths about our nations failure to care for its citizens in the wake of a natural disaster
8907221 and we are still not prepared today we need a national healthcare system that has the capability of stepping in at the time of impact and providing the healthcare services needed
8907222 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8907223 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8907224 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8907225 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8907226 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8907227 settle should not to have taken the money at all this is in breach of the nmc code of professional conduct and at the time her fitness to practice was impaired but the panel had to consider whether her fitness to practice remains impaired today
8907228 the panel was satisfied that settle had demonstrated insight into her previous failing and therefore the public can be reassured that the appropriate remedial action has been taken
8907229 weve been waiting for this for over two years it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over

8907235 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8907236 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
8907237 the objective of echocrt is to demonstrate that optimal medical therapy plus crt reduces all cause mortality or first hospitalization for worsening heart failure in the study population compared to optimal medical therapy alone
8907238 echocrt will provide valuable scientific evidence for this large group of heart failure patients who currently lack treatment options beyond pharmacological therapy
8907239 cardiac resynchronization is a proven life saving device based treatment for certain heart failure patients with ventricular dyssynchrony that is discoordinated pumping action of the heart
8907240 previous randomized controlled trials with crt have been limited to patients with a so called wide qrs an electrocardiogram ecg anomaly that shows longer than normal ventricular activity qrs width 120 130 ms who represent only 30 of all subjects with chronic heart failure echocrt is designed to demonstrate whether patients with ventricular dyssynchrony but narrow qrs or normal ventricular electrical activity on the ecg may derive the same life saving benefits from crt device therapy as other heart failure patients
8907241 the clinical community has long been intrigued as to whether narrow qrs heart failure patients with ventricular dyssynchrony would benefit from crt
8907242 the echocrt study has been designed under guidance from an executive steering committee of 11 internationally renowned academic specialists in electrophysiology heart failure and echocardiography who carefully considered earlier studies in developing the echocrt design biotronik is proud to support this trial which is part of our enduring commitment to landmark clinical research to provide physicians with scientifically sound evidence on which to base their clinical decisions biotronik is also committed to improving patient outcomes and to achieve this the company has significantly expanded its clinical trial program and has embarked on four large international landmark trials including echocrt
8907243 chronic heart failure is associated with a poor prognosis with considerably shortened survival and repeated hospitalizations the vast majority of patients with heart failure present with a narrow qrs and do not currently receive crt the echocrt trial will test the hypothesis whether crt improves outcomes in this large subset of heart failure patients

8907319 i find it particularly interesting that even though we are in an economic recession people view the ethics of company as nearly as important as price
8907320 when we set out we thought the percentages would be higher in canada than in north america as ethical behavior has been prevalent there for longer
8907321 in reality the results varied only very slightly between the two regions suggesting it is a widespread north american trend
8907322 we are working proactively with our suppliers and we are taking action to keep costs to a minimum however given the speed and scale of these rises it is necessary to increase prices for the commercial packaging and industrial markets
8907323 increased costs are having a significant impact on most industries in europe and our industry is no exception

8907426 ik geloof in de kracht en het belang van de foto anders zou ik dit niet al zo lang doen
8907427 het viel me op dat er twintig jaar geleden op fotofestivals nauwelijks aandacht was voor documentairefotografie ik ben toen met michel decron destijds werkzaam bij het blad photo voor de lol eens gaan nadenken over een festival voor de fotojournalistiek toen we hoorden dat perpignan op zoek was naar een evenement dat de aandacht op de stad zou vestigen hebben we een voorstel ingediend dat werd geaccepteerd het festival is inmiddels een ware verzamelplaats geworden voor professionals vorig jaar waren er 250 agentschappen uit 68 landen 3500 professionals en kwamen er 182 000 bezoekers
8907428 ik zeg altijd dat ik keuzes maak op basis van mijn eigen slechte smaak ik vind dat ik fouten mag maken maar een goede foto wekt een emotionele reactie op het doet mij het talent van de fotograaf vergeten en prikkelt tot het stellen van vragen
8907429 moet een journalist niet juist een activist zijn ik zal niet vaak mijn keuze laten vallen op een licht onderwerp ik heb een voorkeur voor reportages waar de aandacht wordt gevestigd op degenen die het onderspit delven
8907430 voor mij staat anna politkovskaya symbool voor de vrijheid van meningsuiting en het recht voor de journalist op vrije nieuwsgaring we moeten tonen wat er in de wereld gebeurt het is waar dat veel mensen pas wisten wat er in de concentratiekampen plaatsvond toen ze voor het eerst de fotos zagen van lee miller en margaret bourke white maar tegenwoordig kunnen we overal bij zijn en alles vestleggen het is misschien moeilijk om beelden uit birma of noord korea te krijgen maar er komt altijd wel iets en ik beschouw het als een plicht om het te laten zien
8907431 nee maar dat vind ik ook helemaal niet erg als je een hoofdcommentaar in een opinieblad leest weet je dat de mening die daar wordt verkondigd een bepaalde politieke kleur heeft dit festival heeft ook een politieke kleur je zal hier maar weinig rechtse mensen aantreffen nicolas sarkozy en carla bruni komen hier niet
8907432 dat is niet waar vorig jaar hadden we 30 exposities slechts 8 of 9 daarvan bevatten gewelddadige beelden maar vergeet niet dit is een festival voor de reportagefotografie en er is nu eenmaal veel geweld in de wereld
8907433 dat klopt het nieuws over sterren wordt steeds belangrijker ik ben niet pessimistisch over de fotojournalistiek wel over de media er worden geweldige fotoreportages gemaakt die worden hier allemaal getoond maar ze worden nauwelijks gekocht
8907434 weve contacted dietitians that have long standing experience in our homes and theyve never been warned about listeriosis or deli meats being a huge issue or that they should be avoided
8907435 the canadian government needs to be a little more aggressive in informing canadians of the risks associated with refrigerated ready to eat foods like deli meats

8907482 la existencia de un contencioso en el tribunal europeo es un toque de atenci n muy severo a la pol tica urban stica del pp pero debe verse como una oportunidad para ordenar un sector industrial que tiene un impacto econ mico y social muy importante en cualquier sociedad desarrollada y particularmente en nuestra comunidad

8907580 dieser justizskandal zeigt wieder einmal den fahrl ssigen umgang mit beschuldigten und verteidigungsrechten und beweist erneut die dringlichkeit einer weiterf hrung der justizreform
8907581 um diese tatsache zu kl ren brauchte die polizei sieben wochen ein solcher fehler in unserem rechtssystem ist nicht hinnehmbar
8907582 nur eine solche scharfe sanktion k nnte sicherstellen dass die polizei die verteidigungsrechte ernst nimmt und wirklich respektiert
8907583 die ausgestaltung der beschuldigten und verteidigungsrechte ist der lackmustest f r die einhaltung klar definierter rechtsschutzstandards

8907587 nachhilfe k nnen sich nur sch lerinnen aus einem finanziell st rkeren elternhaus leisten privatnachhilfe kostet im schnitt 20 euro pro stunde das ergibt bei durchschnittlich zehn ben tigten stunden 200 euro
8907588 die schule soll die verantwortung f r die nachzipfkandidatinnen bernehmen und gratis nachhilfe in der schule anbieten
8907589 sterreich ist eines der wenigen l nder wo sch lerinnen berhaupt noch sitzen bleiben k nnen
8907590 die sterreichischen bildungspolitikerinnen m ssen endlich erkennen dass es sich beim sitzenbleiben um ein rein sch lerinnenfeindliches instrument handelt
8907591 was f r ein p dagogisches verst ndnis ist es sch lerinnen angst einzujagen sie aus dem klassenverband herauszurei en und sie wegen ein oder zwei f chern jahre verlieren zu lassen jahre die dann sp testens beim pensionsantritt abgehen

8907602 das gro e ziel meiner bildungspolitischen arbeit ist dass alle menschen bestm glich nach ihren interessen und begabungen gef rdert werden niemand darf herausfallen kein bildungsweg soll in einer sackgasse enden einrichtungen wie jugend am werk sind dabei von enormer wichtigkeit
8907603 die tolle atmosph re in dieser lehrwerkst tte ist beeindruckend die jugendlichen gehen respektvoll miteinander um und man merkt dass sie einen sinn in ihrer arbeit sehen sterreich braucht solche motivierten gut ausgebildeten menschen in allen bereichen der wirtschaft und gesellschaft
8907604 es ist wichtig diese jugendlichen zu f rdern denn sie haben oft gro es potential das der gesellschaft verloren gehen w rde was wir in jungen jahren verabs umen holen wir sp ter nicht mehr so leicht nach mehr chancengerechtigkeit im bildungssystem muss daher zentrales ziel der bildungspolitik sein

8907607 seit ber einem jahr haben das sterreichische institut f r raumplanung und die linz linien an diesem hervorragenden projekt gearbeitet nun haben sie eine ausgezeichnete grundlage f r ein innovatives verkehrsprojekt vorgelegt bekanntlich k ndigte die vp erst am 7 juli die regierungszusammenarbeit auf es ist daher mehr als b swillig dieses projekt als wahlkampfaktivit t zu denunzieren es w re politisch fahrl ssig dieses gegen ber der alten city s bahn weit bessere projekt nicht genau zu pr fen und umzusetzen im regio liner k nnen sich alle positiven kr fte dieses landes finden es sind alle parteienvorschl ge eingearbeitet nun werden wir es dem landtag umfassend vorstellen und die n tigen beschl sse anstreben

8907609 als man uns dann endlich sp t aber doch eingebunden hat haben wir gute und auch langfristig tragf hige l sungen vorgelegt und einen kompromiss mit den parlamentariern gefunden leider ist dessen umsetzung daran gescheitert dass die koalition im letzten moment quasi implodierte wir sind konsensorientiert dialogf hig und jederzeit bereit an l sungen f r die probleme des systems mitzuarbeiten wir halten unser angebot und die gefundenen l sungsvorschl ge auch f r die kommende bundesregierung aufrecht

8908176 there are three ways humor and laughter help us when life gets bumpy
8908177 the first is that humor gives us perspective and changes the way we see the world
8908178 serious illness is not funny death and dying are not funny but funny things happen in those situations
8908179 i do at my age my back goes out more than i do
8908180 humor is all around you just have to look for it
8908181 it wasnt easy i made gratitude lists read norman cousins fell totally and unexpectedly in love with a good friend hes got a wicked sense of humor and so do i ive never laughed so hard in my life
8908182 when youre told you have a year to live and that youll die an extremely painful death you have two choices you can either prepare to die or you can say oh hell might as well have the best time i can with what i have left for me laughter tipped the balance
8908183 i truly believe a positive attitude helped save my life
8908184 you must give up the constant fussing about things you can do nothing about so you learn to see the small funny things about them
8908185 give yourself a shot in the arm with whatever tickles your funny bone
8908186 humor and laughter arent substitutes for medical care but they can be adjuncts humor can be a tremendous liberating source for coping in tough times
8908187 mom you know according to statistics im supposed to be dead in a month
8908188 well i guess you better hold your breath if youre going to make that deadline
8908189 i think maybe black humor is a form of bravado and also a release for the buildup of painful emotions
8908190 whats not to like actually i think theres quite a bit
8908191 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term

8908196 the director of phuket international airport decided to temporarily shut down the airport because protesters have trespassed on the parking spots and blocked the runways
8908197 the phuket governor is trying to negotiate with protesters now
8908198 the authority shut down both hat yai and krabi airports soon after phuket was closed because officials are unable to operate
8908199 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8908200 we call on our members from every department to exercise their right to take two days sick leave without a doctors certificate because this morning the government attacked people
8908201 behold a farmer went out to sow as he sowed some seeds fell by the roadside and the birds came and devoured them others fell on rocky ground where they didnt have much soil and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth when the sun had risen they were scorched because they had no root they withered away others fell among thorns the thorns grew up and choked them and others fell on good soil and yielded fruit some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty he who has ears to hear let him hear
8908202 to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but it is not given to them
8908203 but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for most assuredly i tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see and didnt see them and to hear the things which you hear and didnt hear them
8908204 hear then the parable of the farmer when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesnt understand it the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart this is what was sown by the roadside what was sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while when oppression or persecution arises because of the word immediately he stumbles what was sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful what was sown on the good ground this is he who hears the word and understands it who most assuredly bears fruit and brings forth some one hundred times as much some sixty and some thirty
8908205 the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field but while people slept his enemy came and sowed darnel also among the wheat and went away
8908206 the servants asked him do you want us to go and gather them up
8908207 but he said no lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel you root up the wheat with them
8908208 first gather up the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn
8908209 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened
8908210 i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world
8908211 explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field
8908212 he who sows the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed these are the children of the kingdom and the darnel are the children of the evil one
8908213 again the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid
8908214 again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls who having found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and bought it
8908215 again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind which when it was filled they drew up on the beach they sat down and gathered the good into containers but the bad they threw away so will it be in the end of the world the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous and will cast them into the furnace of fire there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
8908216 therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things
8908217 where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works isnt this the carpenters son isnt his mother called mary and his brothers james joses simon and judas arent all of his sisters with us where then did this man get all of these things

8908228 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure
8908229 democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
8908230 while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8908231 for part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
8908232 because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from

8908274 we can think were the largest were this were that but when you read major articles that say things like we have joined the mainline denominations i dont like that i dont like that being said about the group i belong to
8908275 ive been meeting some of nambs guys in the area of evangelism about what we can do to help 11 000 churches that post no baptisms what are we doing are we reaching out and connecting with these guys to see what we can do
8908276 we have had some very creative thinking as to what we can do to help those guys and at the same time challenge our own lives our own churches are we being very intentional evangelistically
8908277 we are trying to make a difference with our neighbors but we also must be faithful to keep our eyes on the nations
8908278 when you have hundreds and hundreds of unengaged people groups youve got to have a plan to get someone there i believe we can get our arms around how we really can in our lifetime take the gospel to every person thats pretty exciting if weve got something to aim at weve got a far better chance of hitting it
8908279 every meeting i have been in we still go back to the core the lowest common denominator and that is southern baptists are in dire need of a fresh encounter with god
8908280 i cant do anything with it if im not personally revived or touched by god and renewed in my own personal walk
8908281 i really like the 40 40 prayer vigil because even though ultimately it will get to reflecting on the nation it begins with personal revival im going to lead my church through it and starting with myself
8908282 i need personal revival then we need church revival we need revival among our church leadership and then it continues to move farther out to where it begins to make a difference in our nation
8908283 when there are six candidates being nominated as president of the convention and 20 percent of the messengers that had registered didnt vote for the presidency we have almost gotten where the majority dont care
8908284 im just not impressed if we spend years talking about the victory we won in the conservative resurgence if every time we talk about it we have to turn around and look at our numbers and say wow why will so many gather to talk about what we believe and not rally around a united cause of what were going to do as a result of what we believe
8908285 i plan to do a major challenge for us to trust god for a great commission resurgence
8908286 weve got to do something with what we claim we won or what we claim we have or what we claim we confess
8908287 im really stressing that seminary presidents entertain the idea of giving credit for seminary students to be at the convention
8908288 if we hope to get the next generation there we better get them now why are we waiting until they get a church and they can send them
8908289 i want us to do something that shows the cooperative program in action not just say that it funds something

8908291 younger pastors with a heart to make a difference want to get to guys who are making a difference

8908724 this looked to me like a republican convention in the sense that the staging was magnificent the choreography was magnificent the emotional tone of the speeches was largely superb
8908725 it was pageantry but it wasnt corny it wasnt the old hokey kind of americana it did seem like a parade but it found a balance it seemed serious yet it drew your eyes in
8908726 bill clinton had it with the music but this time they really got the staging and the choreography right now that sounds superficial but if you want people to pay attention to you you have to grab their eyes and their ears and this time the democrats did that
8908727 the republicans all that time have understood that is not how the mind works at all we are fundamentally driven by our emotions
8908728 if you think about what people will remember from this convention theyll remember michelle obamas speech which she did not fill with content
8908729 she dispelled the image that the right have been trying to create of her of the angry black woman with a chip on her shoulder i dont think she could have done that better to say we are just like you

8908763 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
8908764 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
8908765 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8908766 dru yogas affiliation was refused as they are associated with the life foundation an organisation based in bethesda which allegedly engages in cult practice

8908768 i have received lots of calls from people concerned about the group many of whom are ex members
8908769 the concerns i have regarding this group are the same as those i have about much larger groups such as the moonies

8908775 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8908776 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8908777 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8908778 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8908779 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8908780 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8908781 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8908782 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8908783 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8908784 is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8908785 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8908786 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8908787 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8908788 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8908789 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8908790 a misleading speech that was fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8908791 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8908792 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8908793 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8908794 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8908795 brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known
8908796 that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams
8908797 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8908798 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8908799 not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character this is one of our nations greatest defining moments
8908800 on this 45th anniversary of the march on washington and in honor of the legacies of my father and bobby kennedy let us elect a leader who has heard the clarion call
8908801 i would sit in the bathroom here and listen to him over the radio
8908802 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8908804 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8908805 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

8908808 the olympics is a big sports festival with big time coverage
8908809 if powerlifting ever gets into the olympics powerlifting in the u s a would still have 100 different feds they would all think they were screwed out of the olyimpics but anybody that knows a thing about powerlifting knows that with all the countrys the ipf has that it would be the fed that makes it to the olympics all the class 2 and average lifters would stay in all the other feds but all the top lifters from the other feds would join the usapl to try to get to the olympics it would probaly unify powerlifting in the u s a at the top level and that would be a good thing because then the u s a would be number 1 in the ipf once again
8908810 the last thing we want is more athletes coming to powerlifting
8908811 with all of the obscure sports and movements that people win golds for in the olympics there is no defensible reason that powerlifting is not some of them or at least one of them and that would go a long way to solving the unity and lack of competition issues

8908823 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
8908824 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8908825 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done

8908852 nah neither one of em knows both of them split reps with the ones on wednesday and practiced pretty well
8908853 youre looking to grade your team and its hard to do it against yourselves our last scrimmage was kind of a marshmallow contest our defense didnt go full speed and neither did our offensive guys
8908854 we should be able to do something about practicing with a d1 aa team with all the money weve got coming in we should be able to bring a team in for a couple of days put them in a dorm and work out with them
8908855 ill play it by ear ill go with my gut feeling as to when exactly well do it i was thinking about it last night and ill be thinking about it all week i wont know for sure until i get to the game thats just one ill go with my gut feeling on

8908862 thats why we had him in there he can throw the ball and he can run the ball all sort of different ways
8908863 its on life support as the banks try to rescue their loans
8908864 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity
8908865 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
8908866 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets
8908867 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
8908868 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale
8908869 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
8908870 there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group
8908871 we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8908872 theyre clearing the decks after taking massive losses but are by no means out of the woods by any stretch
8908873 management will continue to monitor the new zealand economy and react accordingly
8908874 nsw hoteliers experienced probably their worst trading period in a decade for the year ended june 2008
8908875 smoking bans interest rate rises increased poker machine taxes and a general slowdown in the economy combined to seriously affect turnover and profits
8908876 the good news is that it appears that the decline has halted many publicans have renovated their premises to accommodate smokers in both their bar and gaming venues while at the same time upgrading other features of premises including bistros entertainment lounges and accommodation
8908877 the trend appears to be where possible and viable to create hotels to cater to the broader clientele hoteliers are providing safe premises with increased surveillance and security and when well managed these remain a sound long term business or investment with interest rates set to be wound back and spring around the corner we look forward to a much brighter 2009
8908878 publicans are now realising that they have to focus on those other departments that may have been over the past years overshadowed by gaming revenue
8908879 it is a bit like going back to the old days of course these areas require a little bit more labour input but if you get it right there is a good inflow into the rest of the business
8908880 with the credit crunch and the crisis in gaming there is now a great opportunity for owner operators who may have been priced out of the market to also come back into it as premises come up for sale
8908881 the drop in prices has meant that people who previously wanted to look into this industry are now being able to
8908882 food entertainment and accommodation are now what is being focussed on by the regional and city pubs and clubs they are starting to create venues that are much more well rounded to suit a bigger catchment like families some are even putting in playgrounds and child friendly services
8908883 we focussed on ensuring we didnt have a skew towards one particular revenue stream
8908884 undoubtedly it is very tough out there tougher than it has ever been it really is like the perfect storm of external mitigates like interest rates smoking impost to discretionary spending
8908885 the share of the dollar has impacted on peoples ability to spend on entertainment pursuits and not for some time in our industry has there been this amalgam of issues
8908886 although gaming is our strongest revenue stream we also focus heavily on bar revenue the bottle shop and food and in order to do that particularly on premises you have to provide an environment that people enjoy coming to
8908887 we have to broaden our target market in the industry now and take in families at earlier times than we used to we need to improve food offerings and engage with community groups
8908888 food beverage entertainment and gaming good operators are aware they have to be strong in all those products because they all feed into one another
8908889 if you have a strong food product that will bring customers in and feed on to entertainment on top of that a really strong entertainment product will bring on new clientele
8908890 in the current climate outside areas of premises have also become very important because clients can smoke out there so pubs and clubs have to have a nice outside area which is well serviced with dining and bar these days you have to treat the outside area as importantly as internal areas
8908891 more specifically though it really is now coming down to a strong food and beverage product to be successful businesses like the belgian and bavarian beer cafes are providing a good consistent product and they have opened a number of stores around the city now
8908892 its important that there is also an emphasis on being family friendly getting the kids in to the unrestricted area is important and that means there also has to be an awareness of furnishing and the ambience of an establishment
8908893 purchase of alinta coincided with a rapid deterioration of credit markets
8908894 the battered financial sector found some traction today climbing 2 per cent as traders covered their short positions pushing macquarie bank up over 4 per cent
8908895 the preference shares are a small step in the overall financing
8908896 there are a lot of people in the us who would like a 9 per cent coupon rate at the moment
8908897 ive always owned 100 per cent of the company so this is a first for us
8908898 before i was reliant on securitisation which is non existent
8908899 we can grow the business faster than would have otherwise been the case
8908900 cba has always focused on the home loans business and they have the largest home loan share in australia so there is an alignment of our objectives
8908901 as australias largest home loan provider it makes good strategic sense to look at alternative investments in this industry
8908902 the financial muscle to seize opportunities in the non bank sector
8908903 we continue to be the fastest growing fund in organic terms at least of the top tier funds
8908904 nobody can be quite clear what impact the mls is yet to have and economic circumstances are a factor also correlating phi private health care insurance penetration
8908905 but by and large we still have a situation where theres considerable latent demand
8908906 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
8908907 right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side
8908908 ive been doing it for 20 years and im very focused on the australian and new zealand businesses
8908909 i would like to be able to tell you but i cant tell you
8908910 we want to have them finalised as quickly as we can and we want to make sure we get this absolutely right
8908911 we had new auditors this year and consequently again its just making sure we tick every box now especially with this increased scrutiny
8908912 the parents are still paying fees and the government still pays a fair portion so its a good operation
8908913 i suppose im a bit frustrated when people talk about that there is a very strong possibility that the abc will fall over when thats just not the case
8908914 the bills are paid up to date the rents are paid up to date
8908915 we continue to communicate with our parents to tell them that everything is ok that this is the stock exchange and its about a prior period and its not about where we are going now
8908916 i think our parents trust us and believe in us
8908917 the biggest message for me is that its business as normal
8908918 and we are making sure that we stay very focused on making sure we secure peoples jobs and that children are getting the same great care and education on a daily basis

8908923 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty
8908924 there is a limit with the number of overseas players we can play and a limit to the budget i dont know how much pietersen or flintoff will be available next year with the ashes going on thats a big competition for them
8908925 we need players who can play for us for a longer time and gel with the team not coming and going like that it is a team sport and last year shane warnes side rajasthan won through a team ethic not big names
8908926 we didnt put a whole lot in we wanted to focus on a few things mainly playing really hard defensively trying to play unselfish offensively and play with a level of intensity and speed that we want on both ends and i think all in all they did all that
8908927 im just relaxing going through the motions focusing on academics
8908928 i dont have any favorites everybody is just scattered around
8908929 were not sleeping on those guys theyre a great football club and weve broken down the film on them they have great receivers and great defensive backs a good offensive line and a great quarterback
8908930 hell yes i have a fear of the unknown thats why i dont sleep very well
8908931 even after ive seen it in games i wonder if its going to show up the next game thats coaching its an interesting deal you look at guys and you know what theyre physically made of but you dont know how theyre going to respond to all the situations
8908932 i am going to take some visits in december and some in january
8908933 i want to take all of my visits and i dont know when i am going to decide
8908934 vic coached at troy and has friends in the state i have friend in the state have never had a problem with either school and a guy makes an off the cuff comment and i know were really looking for things to write about talk about on the internet and talk shows
8908935 i promise you koenning had better not come back on this campus weve got one person at the high school who has an escalade and thats the choir director whos been working in the school system for 40 years
8908936 it doesnt bother me at all im motivated anyway whether he came here or not i would still be in the same position im still hungry and i have a lot to prove
8908937 if it hits your fingertips it should be a catch
8908938 we made some mistakes in substitution over there its good you do it today and not saturday its always the guys that have never played they really dont know whats going on and how urgent every situation is today was an adjustment day tomorrow will be a polish day
8908939 i said well do some thursday night games during the season if youll put us on to open college football
8908940 usc players will cover 30 yards of asphalt hard by the bluff road bojangles
8908941 we have to start off with a boom a bang
8908942 its a mixture of two back one back multiple offense i dont know exactly how to define it but its definitely not the spread
8908943 youve got to be a little unselfish to do it
8908944 coach sabans going to do a good job of putting us in a great position
8908945 hes got a great scheme for them so were just going to take every day at practice learning to step up to the game saturday
8908946 how do we replace the two guys who were probably our best pass rushers a year ago wallace gilberry and zeke knight whos going to step up and how effective will we be in those areas
8908947 too many like my whole extended family graduating class every single person whos met me
8908948 if there was a clear cut starter it would be a lot easier to take leadership of the team
8908949 hes hurt pretty bad right now i hope hell be back soon but im not sure hell be ready for saturday

8908954 ich denke dass es ein machbares los ist wir wollen in die gruppenphase und m ssen gegen st patricks weiterkommen ich freue mich ber das los weil ich noch nie in irland gewesen bin wir m ssen aufpassen weil sie den tabellenzweiten aus schweden eliminiert haben
8908955 der weg f r zinssenkungen ist aber trotzdem noch nicht frei
8908956 solange sich die getr bten konjunkturaussichten nicht auch in einem geringeren lohnanstieg niederschlagen werden die inflationserwartungen wohl hoch bleiben
8908957 der h henflug war jedoch von kurzer dauer da seitens der notenbanker die weiterhin hohe inflation ins spiel gebracht wurde dadurch wurde der hoffnung auf eine baldige leitzinssenkung ein d mpfer versetzt
8908958 w hrend sich die ganze woche ber die ums tze in grenzen gehalten haben ist das gesch ft am freitag zusehends lebhafter geworden die ums tze verteilten sich auf nahezu alle papiere
8908959 die zinsm rkte machen was sie wollen und alle h ndler spielen mit

8908963 am st rksten sind die mittelklasse und die obere mittelklasse betroffen
8908964 die intensiven rabatte der hersteller f r neuwagen die ber jahre hin gegeben wurden schlagen nun auf die restwerte durch
8908965 dies k nnte dann den preisdruck bei gebrauchtwagen verst rken aber auch auswirkungen auf das neugesch ft haben
8908966 f r die n chsten vier quartale sehe ich ein risiko
8908967 es stehen drei harte jahre mit wertberichtigungen und verlusten bei den autobanken bevor
8908968 das risiko in europa ist nicht so gro wie in den usa

8908993 so why arent all applications and websites simply converting over to grid computing the answers are numerous and in some cases complex there are companies that dont want to be bothered by the migration and switching costs of moving operations to grid computing new systems and vendors mean additional overhead in switching billing moving data and working out start up bugs that smooth running websites simply dont want to tolerate for the marginal savings there is also the learning curve as system administrators learn the skills needed to manage the grid computing systems versus the dedicated servers that they are used to and well skilled in ultimately there is simply the tried and true system of dedicated servers that has yet to be outdone by grid computing however this is not necessarily the fault of grid computing but simply a byproduct of the massive scalability of the system

8909049 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall

8909076 grosvenor has around 15 or 16 it champions which is a bit above average for the north
8909077 but grosvenor is past the stage where champions are needed technology has now become part of the furniture and pupils and teachers cant do without it
8909078 in the past if you had one child up at the blackboard you would have had 25 other students just sitting around barely engaging switching from blackboards to laptops to interactive whiteboard means they can all participate by manipulating whats happening on the whiteboard and handling tasks ive set them on their laptops
8909079 students themselves are a lot more empowered in the classroom they would use info mapper gis software but many of them are independently using technologies like google earth and wikipedia
8909080 classically trained students would use speedius music software to conduct an entire orchestra while rock guitarists use garage band to develop music sequences
8909081 theyve left the world of t squares behind and theyre not working on some watered down piece of software but something they may use in the working world they respect that
8909082 i would use technologies like excel and powerpoint to teach maths and statistics and across northern ireland maths teachers are getting together to share graphs they would use to teach on whiteboards they are getting together to share their knowledge and cascade that across the schools network in northern ireland
8909083 the idea behind learningni is to get educators and learners to think about their learning and how they interact with resources
8909084 language teachers are uploading mp3 podcasts to act as student aids and as part of their performance related staff development scheme every member of staff this year has met their objective of uploading courses to learningni
8909085 its good to go to a place where no one annoys you
8909086 weve all been blown away by the way schools that are miles apart from each other are making use of videoconferencing
8909087 staff use it for professional development so they no longer have to drive long distances for training after school hours students can go on virtual field trips because were in northern ireland its not easy to get to places like the imperial war museum in london or the great barrier reef in australia students are able to partake in interactive sessions with other students and other teachers in other schools
8909088 the system has a wide range of endpoints from laptops to whiteboards
8909089 because its on the internet you can send lots of information across it and we can have up to 20 other locations on a single call we can communicate with schools we have relationships with in germany spain and chile some of whom only have webcams on desktop computers
8909090 there are 154 c2k computers in this school we purchased an additional 100 computers from c2k with our own funds and we also purchased a further 150 non c2k machines from our own funds with every teacher equipped with a laptop we have somewhere in the region of 550 computers the majority of which are under 18 months old
8909091 its essentially us being careful with money careful effective and efficient spending has allowed us to do what we have we had to be strategic and we had to demonstrate vision other schools havent spent as wisely
8909092 the most important piece in all of this is the students
8909093 going forward talking with companies like microsoft hp and google will be very important because they are the companies whose technologies students are constantly accessing our job will be teaching in an efficient and comfortable learning environment
8909094 a whole generation has grown up with c2k in primary and post primary in the case of post primary some like grosvenor have gone on and enhanced provision and are exploiting c2k fully all of them are taking advantage of what is provided and pupils have an expectation of good technology being made available

8909102 ang panukalang psychiatric test ay isang parte lamang ng iskema ng labor export policy ng gobyerno lalo na ngayon na sa pilipinas gaganapin ang ikalawang global forum on migration and development o gfmd sa oktubre

8909109 paniniktik pananakot at ang pagbibigay ng maling impormasyon ay laging parte ng arsenal ni mrs arroyo sa mga nagpoprotesta ang mga ganitong hakbang ay laging may kaakibat na karahasan ang ganitong mapanganib na konsepto ng pagtrato sa oposisyon ay ginagamit na sa mga instituston ng edukasyon si mrs arroyo ang responsable sa pasismo sa mga eskwelahan

8909158 i actually have no idea why robbie has not gone with george as he was in great form
8909159 having said that it hasnt made a difference to our preparation they are similar players who are both very hard on the ball and are especially good in those defensive situations
8909160 weve been looking at a few micro issues at the breakdown and focusing on presentation of the ball and also the attitude in the collision its going to be another big contest
8909161 dan is in the mould of victor in that hes great at the lineout i was surprised they didnt use dean mumm a bit more but hugh mcmeniman and james horwill are quality players

8909177 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

8909187 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

8909189 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia

8909203 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8909204 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8909205 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8909216 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8909217 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8909218 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8909219 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8909220 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8909221 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8909222 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8909223 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini

8909319 so many games are won in the fourth quarter or lost in the fourth quarter so as much as you can you want to keep those guys fresh for the fourth quarter when we go into the fourth quarter i want our best soldiers on the field and you want to press if a guy plays 65 70 plays you go into the fourth quarter and he doesnt have much gas left
8909320 the game has changed a lot in the 13 years ive been in the league
8909321 before defensive linemen had to do everything now you have guys to rush the passer guys playing against the run they used to have to do both you have to study more because youre probably going against more than one guy
8909322 if you get your opportunity and take advantage of it you can play a while because there are a lot of tricks you can learn as you get older
8909323 its because you dont really have to do much more than block people
8909324 a lot of those other guys even if theyre backups are playing on special teams and putting themselves in position where they can get hurt that has a lot to do with it youre asked to do less youre specializing there arent a lot of other things youre doing
8909325 thats when you can get rolled up from behind thats how you get hurt
8909326 i think a lot of the defensive injuries come from friendly fire you know theyre hitting each other during tackles on top of piles and stuff thats how a lot of them get hurt gang tackling but on the offensive line you can control what you hit and how youre getting hit one of the main things we have to protect is our knees getting rolled up on the line of scrimmage
8909327 they know what spot they have to get to so we have to kind of read off their motions thats pretty much the only advantage they have theyre trying to get their hands on us and we have to prevent them from doing that and get our hands on them first you have to learn how to read certain keys so when you see an offensive lineman move a certain way you know how to react thats the biggest thing for us
8909328 theyve probably helped the offensive linemen because they can hold more
8909329 they dont call holding quite as much they let you grab up in here the chest a little bit i dont think they ever put in rules that help the defense theres a rule that you cant touch a receiver after 5 yards everythings changed a little bit to favor the offense
8909330 you have to hold off guys who are 300 some pounds and at the same time try to get to the ball and make reads see where things are at
8909331 youre legal until you get caught youre doing as much as you can get away with
8909332 of course there are going to be some things that go on in the trenches
8909333 but i dont think there are guys who would intentionally try to take someones career from you i dont think there are players who would intentionally go after your knees i really think everybody has a mutual respect for each other out there
8909334 they probably would try to take advantage of an injury they might know about
8909335 but i dont think they would intentionally dive into your knees if they know you have sore knees i dont think theyd dive into your ankle if they knew you had a sprained ankle they might try to give you some extra moves to keep you off balance but its not like a fighter who sees your ear is messed up and tries to attack your ear
8909336 i think theres actually more skill involved because its very technical
8909337 the players in what are called skill positions are in more of an athletic position theres more skill involved in what we do

8909377 pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
8909378 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8909379 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8909380 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8909381 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
8909382 resta con me per sempre prendi qualunque forma fammi impazzire
8909383 its twilight the safest part of day for us but also the saddest in a way the end of another day the return of the night the night is so predictable dont you think
8909384 se qualcuno vuole uccidere uno di noi dovra passare sul cadavere di tutti gli altri
8909385 ti ho succhiato il sangue fino a quasi alla morte
8909386 le situazioni adesso sono irrilevanti lei ama il modo in cui io la eccito io amo il modo in cui lei respira
8909387 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8909388 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8909389 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8909390 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8909391 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8909392 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8909393 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8909394 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8909395 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8909396 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8909397 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8909398 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8909399 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8909400 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8909401 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8909402 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8909403 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8909404 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8909405 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8909406 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8909407 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8909408 who are open to doing something on the production side
8909409 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8909410 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8909411 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8909412 cele doua au gasit sa se distreze plimbandu se pe sosele intr un autovehicul pe a carui luneta era afisat anuntul suntem rapite la volanul autovehicului in care erau cele doua era un baiat iar un participant la trafic a anuntat politia la 112 cel mai apropiat punct de politie a fost cel din orasul pancota iar politistii au constatat ca cele doua fete au pus afisul doar pentru a se amuza
8909413 bella renditi conto che fino a qualche giorno fa eravamo sole ed ora
8909414 vane non so a te ma a me sembra che stiamo correndo un po troppo con emanuel e dani
8909415 senti bella a me non me ne frega niente di quello che pensa la gente finora non importato niente a nessuno di noi che continuino a fregarsene di noi e della nostra vita e poi dimmi riusciresti a separarti da emanuel perch le persone ti reputano una di quelle non so cosa pensi tu ma io preferirei morire che separarmi da daniele
8909416 stai solo facendo soffrire emanuel ma non te ne rendi conto sei unegoista
8909417 sono andati a fare una passeggiata bella ti devo parlare di una cosa importante
8909418 si tratta di emanuel perch lo tratti cos perch lo escludi perch non parli con lui in questo periodo ti sei staccata un po da tutti che ti sta succedendo hai qualche problema con noi puoi parlarne
8909419 io io dani io devo dirti la verit io sono molto attratta da tuo fratello ma non sono sicura di fare la cosa giusta non so pi cosa giusto lo so sono unegoista perch sto facendo stare in pensiero tutti voi ma ho paura
8909420 bella comprensibile che tu abbia paura io sono consapevole che la nostra presenza potrebbe mettere in pericolo voi ma vi proteggeremo ad ogni costo lo sai questo vero
8909421 ora se non ti dispiace vorrei fare una passeggiata posso solo chiederti un favore dani
8909422 se non ti crea troppo disturbo potresti dire ad emanuel di raggiungermi quando torna vorrei scusarmi con lui
8909423 ciao io mi chiamo isabella e tu come ti chiami
8909424 bella andiamo a casa si sta facendo tardi dammi il bambino lo porto io
8909425 scusa se ti ho fatta venire qui ma almeno stiamo pi comodi
8909426 va bene io volevo scusarmi con te emanuel sono stata unegoista ti ho trattato malissimo
8909427 voglio solo che tu sappia che sono innamorato di te ma so che tu non vuoi
8909428 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8909429 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8909430 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8909431 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8909432 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8909433 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8909434 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8909435 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8909436 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8909437 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8909438 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8909439 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8909440 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8909441 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8909442 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8909443 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8909444 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8909445 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8909446 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8909447 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8909448 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8909449 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8909450 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8909451 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8909452 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8909453 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8909454 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8909455 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8909456 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8909457 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8909458 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8909459 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8909460 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8909461 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8909462 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8909463 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8909464 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8909465 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8909466 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8909467 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8909468 the distance between us and mclaren will be small right down to the wire
8909469 yes we take your insurance but were not sure about the anesthesiologist
8909470 most ers are in need of some urgent care themselves
8909471 if you want to call yourself a world class university and draw people in you give them quality of life
8909472 its the start of a downward spiral that no community no state can afford
8909473 i think its a shame and disgrace to do this as we go into the 200th anniversary of lincolns birthday
8909474 has a very legitimate concern in that the budget was not balanced
8909475 when we go back to veto session in november well try to find places where we can restore money
8909476 there are many different resources out there that will teach you how to easily craft a 300 to 500 word press release and submit it to the various news sources even though creating a press release and submitting it is easy trying to come up with compelling copy on your press releases that will capture your target audience isn t

8909489 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8909490 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8909491 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8909492 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8909493 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8909494 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8909495 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8909496 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8909497 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8909498 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8909499 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama

8909504 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions
8909505 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8909506 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8909507 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8909508 people should be confident they have not been exposed to highly dangerous chemicals
8909509 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8909510 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them

8909519 federal officials have arrested alien smugglers who have had as many as seven different matricula consular cards in their possession these criminal threats are significant but it is the terrorist threat presented by the matricula consular that is most worrisome
8909520 i have said that mexico does not stop at its border that wherever there is a mexican there is mexico
8909521 is to achieve quasi legal status for mexican illegals in the united states without waiting for action from washington
8909522 the department of justice and fbi have concluded the matricula consular is not a reliable form of identification due to the non existence of any means of verifying the true identity of the card holder
8909523 at least one individual of middle eastern descent has also been arrested in possession of the matricula consular card
8909524 identification issued by the federal and or state government requires an acceptable level of proof that the applicant is actually the same person to whom an id has been issued

8909549 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8909550 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8909551 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8909552 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8909553 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8909554 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8909555 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8909556 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8909557 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8909558 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8909559 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8909560 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8909561 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8909565 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8909566 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8909567 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8909568 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8909569 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request

8909592 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8909605 question 5 what is the distribution of temperaments in the us population doesnt the distribution of the web statistics contradict that distribution the estimated distribution of temperaments of us general population are 40 45 guardian 35 40 artisan 5 10 idealist 5 10 rational the web statistics derived mostly from data collected when the sorter was totally free on the web are global statistics not restricted to the us are however to some degree self selecting this self selection bias is not surprising because idealists and guardians generally are more interested seeking out and taking the questionnaires the artisans are typically not as interested in temperament theory as the rest of the temperaments are the idealists are the most enthusiastic of the temperaments about temperament theory on the other hand the web statistics have been stable for years and the millions taking online currently on advisorteam indicate the same distribution
8909606 roadies of the chatty rockstar or something else or keep as is
8909607 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8909608 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8909609 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8909610 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8909611 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8909612 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8909613 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8909614 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8909615 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8909616 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8909617 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8909618 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8909619 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8909620 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8909621 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8909622 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8909623 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8909624 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8909625 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8909626 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8909627 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8909628 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8909629 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8909630 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8909631 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8909632 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8909633 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8909634 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8909635 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8909636 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8909637 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8909638 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8909639 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8909640 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8909641 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8909642 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8909643 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8909644 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8909645 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8909646 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8909647 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8909648 all i know is theres a girl giving a guy a b job in the first episode
8909649 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8909650 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8909651 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8909652 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8909653 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8909654 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8909655 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

8909699 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8909700 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen
8909701 we have serious reasons to believe that directly in the combat zone citizens of the united states were present
8909702 that united states citizens were present in the combat zone that means only one thing that they could be there only on the direct instruction of their leadership and if this is so then it means that american citizens are in the combat zone performing their duties and they can only do that following a direct order from their leader and not on their own initiative
8909703 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8909704 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8909705 what was the gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8909706 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8909707 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the sides and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seemed like an easy solution the thing is it turns out that its not always so
8909708 the experimental warhead section of the rocket hit its pre determined target with high accuracy at the firing range

8909735 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8909736 a few years ago it was all about climate change now energy security has come up too the problems arise when the two come into conflict
8909737 the key issues are now defined by what are coherent responses to these twin concerns
8909738 where there are conflicts it would be dumb to do something which is entirely one at the expense of the other but there are signs of a drift in that direction
8909739 there is clear evidence of backsliding it is our job to make sure they dont this is no time for short term expediency
8909740 until very recently climate change has been top of the agenda but with issues in georgia and increasing energy prices due to increased global demand security of supply will come more to the forefront
8909741 we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear
8909742 governments are very committed to this process i feel sure that the train will reach copenhagen as planned
8909743 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8909744 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8909745 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8909746 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8909747 if they remain independent they will always be subject to the attacks of georgian imperialism
8909748 politely put it is hard to say there was nothing in the files to indicate corruption
8909749 the documents i have seen do not show that the accounts were in the name of mr zardari
8909750 there was indeed such requests from abroad but we cannot be influenced

8909763 recently informed the attorney general and the minister for home affairs that dr haneef is no longer a person of interest
8909764 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8909765 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
8909766 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8909767 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8909768 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8909769 he made sure that he is in no way mentioned as an african american this was an american speaking to other americans colour was not part of this event it was nuanced
8909770 finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8909771 and in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8909772 natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8909773 a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
8909774 who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8909775 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8909776 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learnt that iraq has a 79bn surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8909777 end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8909778 but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8909779 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8909780 it seems as if martial law has been imposed in the valley
8909781 people have been restricted within the four walls of their homes news channels have gone off the air and no newspapers are being published such things dont happen in a democratic set up it is obviously martial law
8909782 new delhi has failed to suppress the people of kashmir by subjugating them for past 20 years if new delhi feels that by resorting to oppression they can suppress the people of kashmir then they are living in a fools paradise
8909783 hardliners are once again ruling the roost and if they continue with the same policy it can have far reaching consequences
8909784 today its a peoples movement and there are no guns new delhi needs to understand it if it continues to use force and hold people of the valley as hostages within their homes situation will worsen and it will add to further alienation
8909785 instead of resolving the issue new delhi is once again trying to suppress the present mass uprising by using force
8909786 some people with vested interests once again want to handle kashmir situation with an iron hand
8909787 people told me that its for the first time that such a curfew has been imposed
8909788 its unfortunate that troopers are barging into the houses of people and are resorting to hooliganism they should learn to respect people
8909789 its a strict situation but its not military rule yet
8909790 its strange that curfew is enforced strictly in kashmir and in jammu it is vice versa this is sheer discrimination
8909791 authorities should have clamped the curfew on august 11 to prevent the situation from taking an ugly turn had they done so many people would not have died and things could have been better
8909792 it should not have happened restrictions should be revoked and curfew should be lifted
8909793 ive got to ask you whats with the pocket business
8909794 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8909795 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8909796 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8909797 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8909798 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8909799 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8909800 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8909801 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
