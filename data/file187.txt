1870083 stomme vragen eigenlijk maar wat moet je dan vragen ik was nieuwsgierig
1870084 ik had al een vermoeden dat dat kleine neeffie van me gevoelens voor jongens had
1870085 daarom heb ik gisteravond een voorzet gegeven en kijk nu eens
1870086 the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
1870087 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
1870088 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
1870089 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
1870090 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
1870091 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information
1870092 through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
1870093 its the middle class that will ultimately shoulder this fiscal burden in terms of higher taxes and lower growth
1870094 39 6 percent personal income tax a 52 2 percent combined income and payroll tax a 28 percent capital gains tax a 39 6 percent dividends tax and a 55 percent estate tax
1870095 sen barack obama d ill on friday announced an emergency economic plan that would give families a stimulus check of 1 000 each funded in part by what his presidential campaign calls windfall profits from big oil separately obamas plan includes a 50 billion stimulus package
1870096 t he windfall profits tax was forecasted to raise more than 320 billion between 1980 and 1989 however according to the crs the government collected only 80 billion in gross tax revenue 146 billion in 2004 dollars the net amount was actually less than this roughly 40 billion because the tax was deductible against corporate income
1870097 crs also found the windfall profits tax had the effect of decreasing domestic production by 3 percent to 6 percent thereby increasing american dependence on foreign oil sources by 8 percent to 16 percent a side effect was declining not increasing tax collections figure 1 clearly shows that while the tax raised considerable revenue in the initial years following its enactment those revenues declined to almost nothing as the domestic industry collapsed
1870098 barack obama is the only candidate who has a real middle class relief plan he will provide 1 000 in a refundable tax credit to working families create a universal mortgage interest credit for homeowners who cant benefit from a mortgage tax incentive available to wealthier americans and create a 4 000 college tax credit for middle class families
1870099 obama will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than 50 000 per year this will provide an immediate tax cut averaging 1 400 to 7 million seniors and relieve millions from the burden of filing tax returns
1870100 im bill clinton and i believe that you deserve more than 30 second ads and vague promises thats why ive offered a comprehensive plan to get our economy moving again to take care of our own people and regain our economic leadership it starts with a tax cut for the middle class and asks the rich to pay their fair share
1870101 and the bush tax cuts people didnt need them and they werent even asking for them and thats why they need to be less so that we can pay for universal health care and other initiatives
1870102 w e know that at a time of war and economic hardship the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for americans who dont need them and werent even asking for them
1870103 this amounts to a tax of over 2 000 on each man woman and child in the united states the foreign aid budget now stands at 300 billion the act would add the additional expenditure to the already huge amount allocated to assist the world
1870104 tax on the rental value of land and natural resources
1870105 fees for the commercial use of the oceans fees for airplane use of the skies fees for the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and a tax on the carbon content of fuels

1870146 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1870147 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1870148 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1870149 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1870150 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1870151 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes

1870162 you know i hit takedowns from all angles all directions and im just relentless with what i need to do to get done
1870163 i think georges has a very explosive style of wrestling but its a fight its not wrestling i mean as far as wrestling skills go we dont utilize all of wrestling in mma so it doesnt even matter
1870164 i have a very stubborn attitude where i wont let myself fail so basically all i can do is just put a hundred percent of my effort into it and i have confidence in that
1870165 if you dont have any confidence in yourself to achieve the things you lay in front of you then youre always going to be a failure
1870166 i struggled early in my wrestling career at purdue because i lacked confidence but ever since i started fighting i put myself on the same playing field mentally with all of my opponents and my confidence is through the roof
1870167 he koscheck had it in his head that no one could take him down if he didnt want them to
1870168 hes really stubborn and he didnt want to listen to anybody when we were telling him to practice his wrestling and i dont think he drilled a single takedown that entire training camp he did all standup and very little jiu jitsu even i havent taken that approach to it i always train everything but ive also gotten back to a little of the wrestling basics again to sharpen things up
1870169 ive been working a lot with javier mendez and thats kind of his specialty so im hitting twice as hard as i used to
1870170 other than that my cardio is on another level right now since this is the first time ive trained for 25 minutes i wasnt sure where i could take my body physically but im increasingly surprised with how great of shape im in
1870171 hes a good guy we know what we have to do and it has nothing to do with disliking each other but come august 9 for that 25 minutes we are going to hate each other as soon as the bout is over with well be friends again

1870349 the early christian art of free standing figures and relief sculptures on sarcophagi retained many aspects of late antique pagan imagery but adapted these to the new stories with no small degree of awkwardness
1870350 things really came to a head in byzantine lands during the eighth and ninth centuries in the controversy which raged between the supporters of the art of mosaic and painted icons and their foes the iconoclasts
1870351 it was not until the protestant reformation of the 16th century and the catholic counter reformation that the issue of religious imagery would again occupy centre stage in european intellectual culture extreme protestant reformers destroyed whatever art they could lay their hands on
1870352 the catholic response was to increase the scale majesty and drama of their pantheon of saints in the fashion of the baroque but not before they had imposed certain restrictions on religious imagery under the aegis of the council of trent 1545 63 no more breastfeeding madonnas and fig leaves had to be applied to the naughty bits of michelangelos great last judgement fresco in the sistine chapel
1870353 the real demotion of christian imagery to a second class artistic genre came with a more gradual and peaceful revolution the age of reason of the 18th century one might surmise that the modern crisis in religious imagery expressed in a vagueness in which any reversion to more traditional iconography can appear kitsch is an effect of the enlightenment certain 19th century romantic painters sought to revitalise christian iconography by relocating it to mysterious and sublime mountain settings in the 20th century the various arms of modernity produced intensely moving religious expressions ranging from the stained glass windows of chagall and the cathedrals of chichester and reims to the subtle rhythms of le corbusiers church of notre dame du haut at ronchamp

1870388 if i found out you were with someone i would be devastated
1870389 leslie its important that you listen because i heard him i heard the voice of god and it is so simple see first of all the soul has no gender so when it is all said and done it is not about whom one loved that is important what is important is the quality of that love we are on this earth for one reason and one reason only and that is to give quality love on a daily basis
1870390 if you are over 18 there is no fucking reason why you need to bum off me you have an id and you should have a job if you are under 18 then i understand i will give you one i have been there and know how hard it is to get some without doing some things you dont want to do or owing some people a favor or two

1870397 the picts have always been an attractive lost people they are one of the most interesting lost peoples of europe
1870398 the big question is what happened to them and did they ever really make a kingdom of their own
1870399 they would have been dreaming of a new rome and a new world connected by water rather than roman roads
1870400 they were the most extraordinary artists they could draw a wolf a salmon an eagle on a piece of stone with a single line and produce a beautiful naturalistic drawing nothing as good as this is found between portmahomack and rome even the anglo saxons didnt do stone carving as well as the picts did not until the post renaissance were people able to get across the character of animals just like that
1870401 the most important piece had a latin inscription thats as common as muck in the mediterranean but extremely rare in scotland
1870402 it says this is the cross of christ in memory of reo and the rest is broken away unfortunately the key bit the name of the person is missing it means theres someone around there who knows how to write in the eighth century that itself is a revelation
1870403 a startling symmetry offering us more than just competence in construction
1870404 the golden section together with its inverse the golden number 1 618 has been valued by artists for millennia and it is a true delight to observe it among their architects
1870405 it shows the importance of symbol and worship in everything done in the service of the christian god
1870406 there is something rather intriguing in the learnt character of them this is a building put up to house metal workers its the idea they were all possessed of the same kind of knowledge and all trying to serve it
1870407 this is staggering to hear but im not totally surprised i think they were pretty sophisticated when you think of all the pictish stones and the wonderful carvings that they made a lot more sophisticated than perhaps they are given credit for in public perception
1870408 there was a war as important as alfreds against the danes in england and the picts got really battered in the annals of ulster there are records of battles where the flower of pictish aristocracy is killed
1870409 portmahomack got burnt down pretty definitively round about 820 the idea is they were under new masters it could be the norse or the men of moray macbeth and his family i think portmahomack was captured by the men of moray the norse wanted it badly but they didnt get it there is no norse material there there was no more vellum making and sculpture and it stopped being a monastery in the ninth to 11th centuries they are making metal work but thats the real dark age

1870423 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
1870424 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
1870425 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
1870426 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
1870427 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
1870428 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
1870429 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

1870431 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
1870432 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there

1870468 stando al catechismo della chiesa cattolica n 1213 il battesimo il mezzo mediante il quale ci si libera dal peccato e rigenerati come figli di dio si diventa membra di cristo ci si incorpora alla chiesa e resi partecipi della sua missione come un bambino di pochi giorni possa essere reso partecipe della missione della chiesa resta ovviamente un mistero della fede
1870469 la sentenza della corte costituzionale n 239 84 invece ha stabilito che ladesione a una qualsiasi comunit religiosa debba essere basata sulla volont della persona difficile a nostro avviso rintracciare tale volont in un bambino di pochi giorni
1870470 infine secondo la legge 196 2003 lappartenenza religiosa considerata un dato sensibile esattamente come lappartenenza sindacale e politica la vita sessuale e la salute dellindividuo non si capisce pertanto perch se la legge impedisce ai genitori di iscrivere i propri figli a un sindacato a un partito politico a unassociazione gay non debba conseguentemente impedire ladesione a unorganizzazione religiosa

1870488 it is criminal that who should make a politically motivated announcement like this under the guise of protecting the health of children in africa
1870489 we need real solutions to malaria in africa not a return to widespread reliance on a failed silver bullet that risks the health of communities already battling this deadly disease
1870490 ddt harms human health and is not the best way to control malaria
1870491 malaria is a disease of poverty and addressing poverty is the long term solution in the short term safer and more effective approaches like bed nets rapid identification and treatment of malaria cases and local education about mosquito control are needed in africa not more ddt
1870492 we reached a consensus on the adverse health effects of ddt in the course of negotiating the stockholm convention
1870493 whos announcement undermines this consensus and goes against the agencys mandate to be at the forefront of protecting health and the environment worldwide
1870494 why has who suddenly decided to undermine an important global treaty
1870495 the agencys job is to help countries control malaria and reduce their reliance on ddt since there is no new evidence supporting increased use of ddt we can only assume whos leadership is listening to the ddt advocates in the u s
1870496 the recent shift in us policy reflects a well organized ddt promotion campaign by a handful of aggressive advocates
1870497 this effort is supported by conservative organizations and think tanks with funding from the u s pesticide industry including monsanto
1870498 the international community must listen to the voices of people directly affected by ddt whether in india and china where ddt is produced or in african countries where its use is being promoted
1870499 we join in demanding that who reverse this irresponsible promotion of ddt and we urge the international community to investigate how politics managed to trump science and common sense at who

1870517 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
1870518 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
1870519 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
1870520 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
1870521 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
1870522 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
1870523 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
1870524 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
1870525 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
1870526 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
1870527 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
1870528 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
1870529 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
1870530 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
1870531 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
1870532 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
1870533 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
1870534 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
1870535 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
1870536 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
1870537 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
1870538 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
1870539 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
1870540 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal
1870541 in the latest sign that the rules of television are being turned on their head the two divisions of time warner inc
1870542 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
1870543 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
1870544 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
1870545 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
1870546 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
1870547 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson

1870550 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
1870551 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

1870559 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
1870560 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company

1870570 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

1870579 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people

1870583 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers

1870590 what about implicit events like the opening hours of the local go kart race track
1870591 the long tail approach to keywords advocates the use of
1870592 the movie studios to their credit use a form of dynamic pricing they intelligently recognize that a content items value is highest when first released and then subsequently fades the music labels have mostly avoided this strategy but perhaps thats changing i just noticed this little tidbit on amazon a long list of interesting cds for sale on amazon for between 6 and 10
1870593 we can study a culture by studying the differences in the power law approximated by the tag clouds used by people of that culture we could even measure cultural eartquakes by measuring the difference between the tag cloud being generated before and after a certain event

1870643 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
1870644 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
1870645 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
1870646 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games

1870735 you mean all those people out there that ive been looking up to because they were not afraid to move ahead with their lives have really been afraid too then that means i have the rest of the world to keep me company
1870736 but what is the catholic church doing these days anyway
1870737 if the world could be fully aware of the health education and welfare network on the planet of the holy see i think they would be totally speechless
1870738 when christians disagree about important matters how do we decide and where do we turn for the final answer
1870739 but where is jesus and how do i know i am loving him and not just the fabrication of my own religious imagination or the subjective opinions of my own tradition how do i know that i am loving jesus and not just pursuing and perhaps manufacturing my own religious experiences
1870740 these things are going to be the death of me
1870741 we were at a point last summer personally and ecclesiastically in the cec where i felt a change was coming sandy and i had found ourselves moving deeper into catholic christianity during our tenure in the cec more recently the draw toward full communion in the roman catholic church had grown greater and became a very strong call in the six months prior to our conversion we are delighted to continue our service to jesus christ and his church as catholics
1870742 it was my great joy to receive randy and sandy sly into the full communion of the roman catholic church at the divine liturgy at saint benedict catholic parish on november 12 2006 what a glorious day it was it was also a wonderful gift to along with deacon keith fournier work with the slys during their period of catechesis leading up to their reception their love for the lord and the ancient yet ever fresh catholic faith is an inspiration their prior years of service to the lord have only prepared them for what lies ahead as they respond to gods continuing invitation to serve him in the new evangelization called for by the late servant of god john paul ii we welcome them home and eagerly anticipate all that lies ahead for them in the fullness of catholic faith
1870743 yes but we can serve christ better outside the catholic church
1870744 thats all very well but i can serve god better as a non christian
1870745 not even god being loyal to his own rules can change our minds or wills without our cooperation

1870754 tottenham hotspur is one of the most talented and entertaining football teams in the premier league and i hope their racing team will show similar qualities on the track
1870755 although the team driver does not have to be the same nationality as the club we certainly have no shortage of british drivers who are very keen to drive for tottenham hotspur

1870774 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets it is essential that we do so the remarkably strong performance of the world economy since the near universal adoption of market capitalism is testament to the benefits of increasing economic flexibility
1870775 nel complesso mentre le economie locali potranno sperimentare significativi squilibri speculativi di prezzo una severa distorsione nazionale dei prezzi sembra alquanto improbabile negli stati uniti

1870896 the main thing is to preserve our culture to preserve the character of tibet
1870897 on account of buddhisms emphasis on rational thinking the tibetans are capable of embracing reality by accepting some of the de facto situation on the ground
1870898 en los que ten a que hacer la misma operaci n no me sal an las cuentas mucho m s razonable
1870899 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god
1870900 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
1870901 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
1870902 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come
1870903 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming for ye are our glory and joy
1870904 to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
1870905 and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
1870906 these brethren are the jewish remnant who will have preached the gospel of the kingdom to all nations during the tribulation
1870907 but if you will notice there is no mention of a resurrection and the persons judged are the nations of the earth also there is nothing said of any books being opened
1870908 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be
1870909 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
1870910 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god
1870911 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
1870912 you will remember that we said only saved people stand at this judgment therefore we cannot lose our souls for we are standing there in resurrection and translated bodies we will not lose heaven at the judgment seat but we can lose our reward
1870913 for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me

1870921 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
1870922 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
1870923 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us

1870926 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
1870927 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
1870928 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
1870929 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
1870930 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
1870931 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
1870932 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
1870933 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
1870934 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
1870935 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
1870936 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
1870937 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
1870938 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
1870939 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
1870940 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
1870941 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
1870942 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

1870960 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1870961 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1870962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1870963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1870964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1870965 the zero reaction of the market was probably given by the fact that all persons interested know very well that setting the date is unrealistic unless we know when and how further reforms particularly as regards the fate of pensions will take place
1870966 last years result was significantly influenced by one off revenues from the sale of cps stake in ceskoslovenska obchodni banka and a one off income from dividends from subsidiaries after deducting these items we are reaching the same indices as last year which is a very good piece of news in relation to this years decrease of financial markets
1870967 her attack was well considered and calculated if an adult person were concerned the method could be classified as a ruthless murder

1870969 komercni banka has managed to profit from the favourable economic situation in the czech republic and is resistant to the problems that come with the mortgage crisis because of its conservative approach to risk
1870970 i dare say we cannot call a growth below inflation an excessive increase
1870971 the price had already posted strong gains in the previous days on expectations of good results and the room for further growth is already limited
1870972 natural gas prices have increased by nearly 10 percent and higher excise duty will gradually be reflected in prices of cigarettes
1870973 the period of rising food prices should also be over
1870974 this factor regularly raises the price level in july in recent years by 0 3 to 0 5 percent
1870975 i do not rule out acceleration of inflation beyond 7 percent
1870976 inflation would reach two to three percent if it were not for the coincidence of those factors
1870977 the labour market is also affected by slower recruitment of new staff due to factory holidays
1870978 of course we welcome the ambassadors return weve always been interested in good relations with serbia

1871015 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists

1871018 the leadership in beijing will almost certainly find his comments irritating or objectionable
1871019 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights

1871037 a dragon can take any form as its form but once it has it can never change back so if a dragon chooses to be a tree it will be a tree for all time if the tree is struck by lightning and is burnt to the ground the dragons spirit would still stand there for 8 years until it could move on it could chose to travel in a butterfly when it chose to move on but when that butterfly died it would still be a tree

1871042 this saga upsets me as a muslim and as a writer who believes that fiction can bring islamic history to life in a uniquely captivating and humanising way
1871043 the series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the muslim world
1871044 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1871045 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
1871046 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

1871061 ambillah shadaqah zakat dari sebagian harta mereka dengan shadaqah zakat itu kamu membersihkan dan menyucikan mereka dan berdoalah untuk mereka sesungguhnya doa kamu itu menjadi ketentraman jiwa bagi mereka dan allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
1871062 dan bersegeralah kamu kepada ampunan dari rabbmu dan kepada surga yang luasnya seluas langit dan bumi yang disediakan untuk orang orang yang bertaqwa yaitu orang orang yang menafkahkan hartanya baik di waktu lapang maupun sempit dan orang orang yang menahan amarahnya dan memaafkan kesalahan orang lain dan allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat ihsan muhsin
1871063 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman itu adalah mereka yang apabila disebut nama allah gemetarlah hati mereka dan apabila dibacakan kepada mereka ayat ayat nya bertambahlah iman mereka karenanya dan kepada rabblah mereka bertawakkal yaitu orang orang yang mendirikan shalat dan yang menafkahkan sebagian dari rezeki yang kami berikan kepada mereka itulah orang orang yang beriman dengan sebenar benarnya mereka akan memperoleh beberapa derajat ketinggian di sisi rabbnya dan ampunan serta rezeki nikmat yang mulia
1871064 siapakah yang mau memberi pinjaman kepada allah pinjaman yang baik yaitu menafkahkan hartanya di jalan allah maka allah akan memperlipatgandakan pembayaran kepadanya dengan kelipatan yang banyak dan allah menyempitkan dan melapangkan rezeki serta kepada nya kamu dikembalikan
1871065 orang orang yang beriman dan berhijrah serta berjihad di jalan allah dengan harta benda dan diri mereka adalah lebih tinggi derajatnya di sisi allah dan itulah orang orang yang mendapatkan kemenangan
1871066 maka bertaqwalah kamu kepada allah menurut kesanggupanmu dengarlah dan taatlah serta nafkahkanlah nafkah yang baik untuk dirimu dan barangsiapa yang dipelihara dari kekikiran dirinya maka mereka itulah orang orang yang beruntung
1871067 adapun orang yang memberikan hartanya di jalan allah dan bertaqwa dan membenarkan adanya pahala yang terbaik surga maka kami kelak akan menyiapkan baginya jalan yang mudah
1871068 ada tujuh golongan yang akan dinaungi oleh allah pada hari yang tiada naungan kecuali naungan nya
1871069 abu khair setiap kali dia berbuat kekhilafan maka dia akan bershadaqah untuk menutupi kesalahannya tersebut meskipun hanya dengan sepotong kue atau sebutir bawang atau yang lainnya
1871070 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam keluar ke tanah lapang pada hari raya qurban atau fitri kemudian selesai melaksanakan sholat beliau khutbah di dalam nasehatnya kepada manusia beliau memerintah kan mereka untuk bershadaqah seraya bersabda
1871071 wahai kaum wanita bershadaqahlah kalian karena saya melihat kebanyakan penghuni neraka adalah dari kalian
1871072 takutlah kalian kepada api nereka walau hanya bershadaqah dengan setengah butir korma
1871073 untuk siapa saja yang berkata baik memberi makanan selalu berpuasa dan melakukan qiyamul lail sholat malam sedang orang orang dalam keadaan tidur
1871074 tiada suatu hari yang dilewati oleh hamba hamba allah kecuali ada dua malaikat yang turun salah satunya berdoa
1871075 allah memusnahkan riba dan menyuburkan shodaqoh dan allah tidak menyukai setiap orang yang tetap dalam kekafiran dan selalu berbuat dosa
1871076 ya rasulullah saya tidak memiliki harta kecuali apa yang diberikan suamiku zubair kepadaku apakah saya juga bershadaqah
1871077 bersadaqahlah dan janganlah engkau terlalu memperhatikannya memperhatikan kwantitasnya sebab allah tetap memberikan perhatian nya kepadamu
1871078 jika engkau melihatnya kesulitan maka bebaskanlah hutangnya mudah mudahan dengan hal itu allah membebaskan kita dari azab nya
1871079 ketika dia meninggal dunia maka allah membebaskannya dari azab nya

1871180 no parson theres more so jennifer tossed billy baker jennifer was the pitcher a little blooper i mean she had to throw him a little blooper because he really does bat like a girl so anyway he fouled the ball off i cant believe he fouled that gift of a pitch but he did and the ball cracked the window next to the front door listen parson if anybody besides billy baker had been batting that pitch would not have been fouled and if it was it would have gone through the window and not just cracked it geez parson that kid is a sissy

1871296 porque reducen el pluralismo eclesial de nuestra di cesis y la entregan a corrientes e instituciones supradiocesanas cuyo objetivo inmediato no es servir a la di cesis

1871339 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
1871340 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
1871341 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
1871342 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
1871343 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

1871352 you cant please the world thats for sure you just have to do what you love
1871353 one interesting part of the story that maybe you havent gotten yet is that i really did try to get it published i finished the book five or six times it became almost a manic depressive practice where i would change it quite a bit and it got better each time
1871354 i saw selden on and off over the whole 30 years
1871355 and you know when someone tells you they are writing a book well a lot of people say they are writing a book so you wait to see what will come of it
1871356 one interesting part of the story that maybe you havent gotten yet is that i really did try to get it published i finished the book five or six times it became almost a manic depressive practice where i would change it quite a bit and it got better each time for instance there was a five year stretch where i worked on a version that eliminated the time travel but it came back i will tell you this though as hard as the rejection was i am glad now that i did not publish the first draft
1871357 when i did read it i was on the verge of tears the whole time
1871358 i just kept looking up at his name which is at the top of every page and thinking that this is incredible he was always really working and he was making something so complex and beautiful that it took that whole time
1871359 there was this sense of familiarity as though what he had written was a shared history
1871360 i liked the erudition and hearing about all the great artists and thinkers of vienna but then i began to see that the book also told the story of the flower children and the new agers and that it had reached a place where it wasnt just about one life but more about the evolution of the soul in history
1871361 i got up at 4 30 on the third day that i was reading it in order to be finished before i left for work and when my wife woke up i looked at her and said i think this is an important book it really feels like it has been in the making for that whole time let me put it this way i have yet to meet the person who could write this book in a year
1871362 the biggest gift that my characters offer one another is what dorothy gets at the end of her story when she is given the belief that she is good enough and that whatever else has happened in the past she is now set free to be herself and to do her job
1871363 so you are saying there is biblical permission for this sort of thing
1871364 i dont think that is what my aunt prudence had in mind when she read ecclesiastes
1871365 you know there is something i have been very desirous of doing
1871366 because the contribution he made was to demonstrate the value of truly fearless introspection freud had a kind of doggedness an insistence that introspection not stop that it should keep going until the patient was free to devote his or her life to the core human activities love and work and thats what wheeler burden is able to do for his beloved he sets her free from her past to do what she was meant to do

1871375 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
1871376 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year

1871427 i receive hundreds of questions from consumers who are in the market for new carpet but in the past few months ive seen an increase in questions from homeowners who are planning to sell or having a hard time selling their homes
1871428 im selling my home soon what grade of carpet should i select and how much should i spend
1871429 thats not a positive approach says fletcher to help sell a home faster and for a higher price i recommend replacing worn or pet damaged carpets with a new medium grade neutral color carpet
1871430 a matted down or pet damaged carpet is very unsightly and unsanitary and may scare off potential buyers
1871431 in the 90s selling a home was quick and easy here in portland
1871432 those days are gone for now says fletcher with the dramatic increase in fuel prices i think people will be investing more money fixing up their homes and enjoy spending more time at home
1871433 there are so many unscrupulous carpet dealers and carpet scams to watch out for and honest and experienced carpet salespeople are getting harder to find
1871434 im not sure about this price it seems pretty high to me i need to think about this a little more just to make sure im making the right decision
1871435 your carpet didnt get put on the truck for some reason someone was supposed to call you last week and reschedule your installation im very sorry
1871436 the manufacturer says your carpet should arrive here by the 12th
1871437 there are so many carpet scams to watch out for its truly amazing
1871438 most consumers dont do their carpet buying homework they make the mistake of following the advice of inexperienced salespeople pay way too much and end up buying carpet that doesnt last
1871439 in addition to providing free information on my website my goal is to help consumers avoid common carpet scams by offering a free list of preferred carpet dealers im using all my 30 years of carpet experience to weed out the wolves and find dealers who i believe are reputable and have friendly knowledgeable and experienced salespeople
1871440 ive found some reputable dealers located off the beaten path so to get the best service and prices consumers may have to drive a little bit out of their way
1871441 consumers deserve a fair shake and if i find out that a dealer is doing the old
1871442 its in a dealers best interest to provide first class service to my readers
1871443 because dealers that make my list will be quite pleased with the number of new customers i can send their way

1871474 most blacks not all but most in tennessee especially in the memphis tennessee area are still living in the 50s and 60s they are so racist that they dont even realize that white americans have moved on and so whenever theres a campaign like this such as this they always use racism in order to intimidate white america
1871475 if obama uses the words oh by the way theyre going to try and make you fear me after all im black thats not playing the race card
1871476 barack obamas not going to say anything because well first of all steve cohen the white incumbent endorsed barack obama before this black woman did but because this woman is black and shes a democrat hes not going to say anything for fear of losing the black vote so its more about race than anything else
1871477 it works for black liberal democrats because they have managed to intimidate white americans barack obama understands that this will work you have to remember that barack obama sat under one of the most racist creatures in america teaching black liberation theology for 20 years so he had to be doing that because he agreed with it
1871478 lets not forget louis farrakhan he spoke at his rally so it is about race and barack obama understands that
1871479 there would be a lot of finger pointing and they would be pointing justifiably at us

1871497 well i never thought id end up here never thought id be standing where i am i guess i kind of thought that it would be easier than this i guess i was wrong now one more time
1871498 so when will this end it goes on and on over and over and over again keeps spinning around i know that it wont stop till i step down from this sick cycle carousel
1871499 this doubt is screaming in my face in this familiar place sheltered and concealed and if this night wont let me rest dont let me second guess what i know to be real put away all i know for tonight and maybe i just might learn to let it go take my security from me and maybe finally i wont have to know everything

1871506 you dont know why they had to go this far traded your worth for these scars for your only company and dont believe the lies that they have told to you not one word was true youre alright
1871507 if i could touch the sound of silence now you know i would if i knew how to make these intentions come around
1871508 im trapped inside of my own mind afraid to open my eyes cause of what id find and i dont want to live like this anymore
1871509 have you ever felt like your only comfort was your cage youre not alone ive felt the same as you have you ever felt like your secrets give you away youre not alone ive been there too cause everyone is looking and everyone is laughing but i think everyone feels the same everybody wants to feel ok

1871524 tdk akan merasakan manisnya kehidupan akhirat orang yg suka terkenal di tgh manusia

1871690 omg i do keep getting up thats why im so thrashed
1871691 when it comes to our behavior from moment to moment the big question is what to do next
1871692 well were finding that we have these unconscious behavioral guidance systems that are continually furnishing suggestions through the day about what to do next and the brain is considering and often acting on those all before conscious awareness

1871694 its rather like showing you can hot wire a car to start the ignition without keys thats important and potentially useful information but it doesnt prove that keys dont exist or that keys are useless

1871697 making up the mind how the brain creates our mental world
1871698 sometimes nonconscious effects can be bigger in sheer magnitude than conscious ones
1871699 because we cant moderate stuff we dont have conscious access to and the goal stays active
1871700 we know that as soon as people feel theyre being manipulated they do the opposite it backfires

1871792 it is very pathetic to see the helpless unhealthy mothers struggling to breastfeed their hungry children since no milk is available on them
1871793 starvation is the most painful affair in human life and several mothers are forced to sell themselves for food and shelter i met several families who will sell themselves for a piece of bread

1871906 second quarter results highlight our emphasis on residential solar power installations and the continued growth in that market second quarter revenues of 7 1 million reflect a 6 5 sequential increase in residential installations but were overshadowed by a decline of 79 in commercial installations
1871907 although our pipeline of commercial jobs has never been larger because commercial installations span multiple quarters we expect to see continued revenue volatility as commercial projects become a larger portion of our revenue mix on the cost side we reduced cash g amp a operating expenses by 0 6 million during the quarter a greater amount than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and have reduced headcount by 36 positions since the beginning of the year we remain on track to remove a total of 2 million in cash expenses by year end compared to our original plan
1871908 to help cash strapped consumers purchase a solar power system they now have a range of financing options including residential power purchase agreements ppas leases and home equity lines commercial customers continue to take advantage of ppa financing to purchase their systems
1871909 as part of our strategy of pursuing market segments in which we have a competitive advantage we introduced the andalay flat roof system during the quarter optimized for large commercial flat roofs this new andalay system satisfies an unmet need for a highly reliable flat roof installation that is lightweight very quick to install and does not require a myriad of potentially leaky roof penetrations in the residential market andalay panels continue to maintain their premium pricing in addition to receiving several industry awards for andalay we also received u s patent 7 406 800 covering certain key claims of our technology
1871910 despite the prolonged uncertainty about the passage of the investment tax credit itc interest in solar power shows no signs of abating our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13 6 million bookings are at record levels and our pipeline of residential and commercial projects continues to grow and extend into the first half of 2009 still there is no question that economic weakness and the delay in the passage of the itc is impeding industry growth this year
1871911 we now expect to grow revenue in 2008 between 30 and 40 over 2007 with the growth rate contingent on the number of commercial jobs completed before the itc expires at the end of 2008 our growing backlog and expanding pipeline of both residential and commercial jobs gives us confidence that we have the right strategy and necessary infrastructure to capitalize on pent up demand in 2009 and achieve a profitable business model as a result we expect to achieve cash breakeven in the second half of 2009 assuming passage of the itc in early 2009
1871912 during the second quarter our total pv module shipments increased significantly largely as a result of improvements in throughput and operational efficiency at the existing facilities attributable to our r amp d efforts carried out at each stage along our vertically integrated manufacturing process the production of thinner 180 micron wafers throughout the quarter higher yields resulting from reduced breakage rates and higher cell conversion efficiency rates
1871913 as of today substantially all of our estimated production output in the second half of 2008 has been contractually secured with solid demand from existing pv markets and growing demand from emerging pv markets we have also further expanded our sales in emerging pv markets including korea italy france belgium the united states and china which demonstrates our strong ability to effectively build up our brand and extend our presence globally we believe our position in these markets will further improve our brand recognition and generate well balanced sales portfolio in the future
1871914 on the polysilicon procurement side in addition to our four long term contracts with wacker the new supply agreements with dc chemical and sailing demonstrate our collaborative relationships with existing suppliers and our ability to attract new partners additionally as previously reported our expansion projects remain on track construction equipment delivery and installation and personnel training are progressing as planned we are expecting total production capacity to reach 400 mw in late 2008 and 600 mw towards the middle of 2009
1871915 as a result of our strong momentum stated above we feel comfortable raising our expected pv module shipments and net revenue targets for the full year 2008 we are confident that the continued successful execution of our vertically integrated strategy will strengthen our leading position in the pv industry in both the near and long term
1871916 the metabolic activity of resting seeds increases as soon as they are hydrated during soaking complex biochemical changes occur during hydration and subsequent sprouting the reserve chemical constituents such as protein starch and lipids are broken down by enzymes into simple compounds that are used to make new compounds
1871917 sprouting grains causes increased activities of hydrolytic enzymes improvements in the contents of total proteins fat certain essential amino acids total sugars b group vitamins and a decrease in dry matter starch and anti nutrients the increased contents of protein fat fibre and total ash are only apparent and attributable to the disappearance of starch however improvements in amino acid composition b group vitamins sugars protein and starch digestibilities and decrease in phytates and protease inhibitors are the metabolic effects of the sprouting process

1871988 he drove at full throttle around the corners and overtook in some unbelievable places
1871989 en la web creo que quedar an elegantes no se unos negros unos blancos y no se unos platas que te parece
1871990 que te parece si ponemos el texto negro con un negro m s subido no se otro negro m s oscuro
1871991 off with their heads off with their stinking boring heads
1871992 how can we protect ourselves and community from different disease e g hiv aids
1871993 what are the rights of male and female in the community
1871994 how can we protect our youth from narcotics and how can we convince them to educate
1871995 its not clear ed how people and matched to roles and what is going on
1871996 i could see in this dream of mine the silvery light of the moon light my path up the stairs to my childhood home i knew i was dreaming so i felt the moment quite special i would open the screen door in my dream to quietly enter the house without my parents noticing i was home late from a place i should not have been
1871997 as i took the first step up the stairs from the cellar to the first floor i noticed the light outside of my home was getting brighter
1871998 onto the raised stone patio to watch this unigue light show at midnight in my dream
1871999 once having kissed this tablet in this dream i do remember seeing a symbol out of the corner of my eye i would later find out to be the hebrew symbol for the number 16 a symbol
1872000 stunned by this i would ask again who are you
1872001 the light drew further from me and the voice from within says i am the messiah
1872002 once more the light drew further from me but the light seemed now to bloom like a flower the occupant within said softly i am jesus the christ
1872003 you could want to have god sitting at your left and you on the right and if you would ask who he was you still may not believe in a good way what lies before your very eyes the son of god the one who loves you always
1872004 why dont all christians experience god like todd bentley benny hinn jesse duplantis etc why does it always seem that those who have these kind of experiences are never the common christian
1872005 is because some family members had read todd bentleys book todd is the leader of the current revival in lakeland florida anyways we were talking about some of the experiences that todd talks about in his book the idea was brought up that god speaks to people but some people almost get to experience god more because they spend 8 hours in prayer everyday
1872006 you shall heal the sick raise the dead and cast out demons but only if for the next 6 months you spend 8 hours in prayer everyday
1872007 i know this is gonna sound like i am promoting a book but i guess i am just gonna have to deal with the reprecussions
1872008 like you i always wanted to have a vision or some kind of sensational dream that would set me apart from all those other persons with whom i worshiped
1872009 after far too many years of hoping upon a dream or a vision i discovered something very interesting we
1872010 for years centuries and even decades we have taught that our self is so weak and helpless weve pin all our happiness on the hope that only something or someone extraordinary can make us better makes us happier
1872011 in other words we believe far more in an illusion of weakness than we do in the reality that it is god that brings us to life god that molds and shapes us with his uncompromising love and unending desire for perfection
1872012 i have not a clue why you worship in such ways what is that all about
1872013 the lovely aspect of such a viewpoint is that we are left to act as god would want us to from the very beginning loving our neighbor as god would express love in us
1872014 you could want to have god sitting at your left and you on the right and if you would ask who he was you still may not believe in a good way what lies before your very eyes is the son of god the one who loves you always

1872396 tell the government that if they dont change the law we will not make any money
1872397 originally i really welcomed the olympics but because of these unfair regulations and treatments ive started losing my passion for the event and ive become more indifferent
1872398 does such an extravagant games necessarily demonstrate our countrys strength and prosperity
1872399 i think the so called century old dream isnt the peoples dream and the so called best olympics is nothing more than the most costly games
1872400 i am pleased that we have met all of the first half milestones that we set out at the end of last year
1872401 we demonstrated our single stage sputter deposition process producing cigs films with greater than 14 percent conversion efficiency over large areas
1872402 during the first half of 2008 daystar designed built and began operations of its manufacturing prototype cigs coater big baby and we have begun process scale up by depositing cigs on 2 x4 glass panels we secured a manufacturing facility for our first production line and we have placed orders for the equipment to build that line looking forward the company expects to have a scaled up cigs deposition process on big baby by the end of this quarter and we expect to begin the build out of the manufacturing line in september which is necessary for our production line to be up and running in our new facility in the first quarter of next year
1872403 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it

1872408 two and a half years after their arrival the ipkf a large number of their troops died an equal number was injured the indian government spent around 1050 billion us dollars we have to accept these the ipkf came here to disarm young sri lankan militants but what they did was to give back their weapons to them before leaving sri lanka the occurrence of clashes between the ltte and the eprlf is a result of the indian armys presence in fact we can say that the indian army made a mess of it instead of taking back the surrendered weapons with them they gave them to people here

1872413 all our three paediatricians reported an increase in the number of patients treated recently the patients are mainly children with a history of asthmatic and respiratory ailments
1872414 until the air quality improves parents should ensure good air circulation inside the house by turning on the fan or air conditioner if your kids are not feeling well it is best to see a doctor and keep them home
1872415 it is not as many as last year but we dont know whether the situation is going to become more serious later this month
1872416 the skies became hazy about two weeks ago and by next week we should have clear skies again because of the inter monsoon winds
1872417 because of the morning showers the dust particles are cleared up quite quickly so the visibility usually improves for a while however fair weather in the later part of the day reduces the visibility again because there is no rain to clear the air
1872418 the public should note that low visibility is not always caused by the haze when there are thunderstorms the clouds are low thus the sky appears hazy this normally occurs in the morning
1872419 there were more hotspots last year and the weather was drier
1872420 the visibility there was 1 5km in the early morning but the situation improved to 3km at 10am in bayan lepas and prai the visibility was between 6km to 8km at 8am
1872421 although it rained in both the industrial areas of bayan lepas and butterworth the visibility was better on the island because geographically it is surrounded by water so there is more water vapour in the air

1872433 people have no idea whats best for them so we need a government to manage our social affairs and intervene in our personal lives
1872434 people in third world nations dont know whats best for them but we americans do and will impose our will even if it means annihilating their way of life
1872435 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
1872436 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1872437 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
1872438 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
1872439 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
1872440 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
1872441 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
1872442 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
1872443 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
1872444 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
1872445 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
1872446 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1872447 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1872448 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1872449 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1872450 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1872451 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
1872452 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1872453 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1872454 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1872455 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
1872456 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
1872457 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
1872458 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
1872459 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
1872460 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1872461 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
1872462 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
1872463 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
1872464 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
1872465 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
1872466 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
1872467 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1872468 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1872469 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
1872470 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
1872471 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
1872472 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
1872473 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
1872474 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
1872475 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
1872476 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1872477 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
1872478 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1872479 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
1872480 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
1872481 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
1872482 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
1872483 when you look into the mirror in the morning what do you say to yourself
1872484 i see the person in the mirror and tells him remember you are no more than a small servant ahead of you today is the heavy responsibility and that is to serve the iranian nation

1872497 aparte se do mal e fa a o bem busque a paz e siga a
1872498 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1872499 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1872500 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1872501 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1872502 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1872503 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1872504 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1872505 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1872506 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1872507 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1872508 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1872509 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1872510 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery

1872551 if i would care to generalise and to say that the life of the jews in the camps was especially hard i could and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation but in the camps where i was kept it was different the jews whose experience i saw their life was softer than that of others
1872552 but it is impossible to find the answer to the eternal question who is to be blamed who led us to our death to explain the actions of the kiev cheka secret police only by the fact that two thirds were jews is certainly incorrect
1872553 my book was directed to empathise with the thoughts feelings and the psychology of the jews their spiritual component
1872554 i have never made general conclusions about a people i will always differentiate between layers of jews one layer rushed headfirst to the revolution another to the contrary was trying to stand back the jewish subject for a long time was considered prohibited zhabotinsky a jewish writer once said that the best service our russian friends give to us is never to speak aloud about us
1872555 richard wagner did not like the jews but was a great composer dostoyevsky was a great russian writer but had a very sceptical attitude towards the jews
1872556 this is not a book about how the jews and russians lived together for 200 years but one about how they lived apart after finding themselves on the same territory this book is a weak one professionally factually it is so bad as to be beyond criticism as literature it is not of any merit
1872557 i would not doubt his sincerity he says that he firmly supports the state of israel in his fiction and factual writing there are jewish characters that he writes about who are bright decent anti stalinist people
1872558 trotskys idea was that the spread of anti semitism was partly down to objections about their entrance into the civil service there is something in this that they were not just passive spectators of the revolution they were part victims and part perpetrators
1872559 it is not a question that anyone can write about without a huge amount of bravery and it needs doing in russia because the jews are quite often written about by fanatics mr solzhenitsyns book seems much more measured than that
1872560 the question of ethnicity did not have any importance either in the revolution or the story of the nkvd this was a social revolution and those who served in the nkvd and cheka were serving ideas of social change
1872561 if solzhenitsyn writes that there were many jews in the nkvd it will increase the passions of anti semitism which has deep roots in russian history i think it is better not to discuss such a question now
1872562 the only living spiritual force capable of undertaking the spiritual healing of russia
1872563 allow competition on an equal and honorable basis among all ideological and moral currents in particular among all religions
1872564 solzhenitsyn looks into bogrovs mind as he is preparing to assassinate stolypin stolypin is reviving russia therefore its bad for the jews he assassinates him acting entirely in his capacity as a jew but the historical bogrov was a jewish renegade not acting as a jew at all
1872565 every culture has its own brand of anti semitism in solzhenitsyns case its not racial it has nothing to do with blood hes certainly not a racist the question is fundamentally religious and cultural he bears some resemblance to dostoyevsky who was a fervent christian and patriot and a rabid anti semite solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the russian extreme rights view of the revolution which is that it was the doing of jews
1872566 on balance over all taking into account all his work and his entire biography i dont think you can call aleksandr solzhenitsyn an anti semite he has a very sharp pen i admit hes extremely passionate he has some sharp things to say about jews but he has sharp things to say about russians who are not jews the most you might say about solzhenitsyn is that he resents the intrusion of foreign influences into russian life but an anti semite no when you take his whole work and his whole life into account you must say that he is not anti semitic and that he doesnt hate liberalism he is inconsistent perhaps but many great people are inconsistent
1872567 too honest too courageous too great a writer for solzhenitsyn to be an anti semite would be wholly out of character i am only disturbed by what seems to be an unconscious insensitivity on his part to jewish suffering
1872568 if for no other reason than to reassure his jewish admirers who want to like and respect him without reservations
1872569 well i understand that as a russian he is concerned mainly with russians the way im concerned mainly with jews
1872570 he is a strong supporter of israel and always has been
1872571 if you support israel the way solzhenitsyn does today you are not an anti semite and i dont think his idea of a russian state founded on the russian orthodox church means that jews would not have full rights how about israel lets call a spade a spade in israel religion is not separate from the state solzhenitsyns russia would be built on the same principle
1872572 in order not to repeat the horrors that humanity perpetrated on itself in the 20th century all types of revolutionary and ethnic genocide
1872573 a jewish question existed and was a burning issue but at that time hundreds of authors including jews wrote about this at that time precisely the omission of mentioning the jewish question was considered a manifestation of anti semitism and it would be unworthy for an historian of that era to pretend that that question did not exist
1872574 i am developing the red wheel the tragic history how russians themselves in folly destroyed both their past and their future and in my face is flung the base accusation of anti semitism cynically used as a club by some and a string of false arguments is basely ascribed to me
1872575 concerning the label anti semitism this word just as other labels as well has lost its precice sic meaning from thoughtless use and different publicists in different decades understood it differently if a biased and unjustified attitude toward the jewish nation is understood by this term then i tell you assuredly not only is there no nor could there be anti semitism in my work nor for that matter in any book worthy of being called literature to approach a literary work with the measuring stick of anti semitism is vulgar an under developed understanding of the nature of a literary work by this measuring stick shakespeare could be proclaimed anti semite and his creative work struck out
1872576 you dont understand the attitude today of the russian intelligentsia anti semitism is held in such contempt now that if a member of the intelligentsia knows you are an anti semite he wont shake your hand solzhenitsyn doesnt care what people think of him here in the united states what he cares about is what russians will think who hear about this on radio liberty or the voice of america
1872577 my task is to write true historical research on the russian revolution beyond that its not so important to me whether my books are accepted precisely in this decade and precisely in this country

1872738 my child did you control the timing of your own birth did you decide your own bodily features
1872739 then can he who brought you to this earth without your consent at that exact time take your soul at an exact time without your consent
1872740 yes but dad i know i feel in my heart i will not die now
1872741 my son before your birth you did not know that you will be born and on what time therefore you do not know when you will be taken back to him and at what time
1872742 i love allah and that is enough for him to forgive me
1872743 by beloved son can a parent be satisfied with a disobedient son though the son declares their love for them
1872744 then the one who created the whole universe the supreme the irresistible cannot be content with his slave upon creation who disobeys him despite such a slave saying that he loves his lord
1872745 you show your love for allah by obeying him and his messenger salla allaahu alayhi wa sallam
1872746 mother why is life like this why must i do this and do that i dont want to live my life in boredom trying to avoid almost everything
1872747 ahmad she is your mother show respect not only that but show respect to your creator who gave you life and gave you a wonderful mother who loves you there are ways to have fun in islam
1872748 how is allah merciful when he sends people to hell
1872749 then is that not an example of allahs mercy keeping you alive after you insulting the most gracious
1872750 you are all so boring why cant we be like other religions who say enjoy life to the max i am ashamed to be who i am
1872751 for god sake why its only 1 00pm in the afternoon
1872752 its only 1 00pm are you insane almost the whole population is out of bed and you are acting as it is 6 00am
1872753 because you are coming to the mosque with me today for prayer i want you to experience just one prayer in your life
1872754 now i will be up in two minutes with a cup of cold water to throw over you if you are not out of bed
1872755 ahmad i cannot believe you are so angry with the thought of standing before allah
1872756 i could be at home playing my computer instead i am tiring myself out by having to stand for 10 hours in boring prayer
1872757 are you crazy no prayer lasts that long not even half of that time now pull yourself together because the way you are storming down this road seems to me you are suffering from constipation
1872758 dad those people must have heard yet again you embarrass me
1872759 embarrass you the way you are composing yourself on this street is humiliating me your father right here we are now behave yourself for once
1872760 mashahallah my beloved son you see is there anything more beautiful than prayer you even cried to allah
1872761 no no no i cried because i just realised that i left my mobile at home and i promised to call mo
1872762 you are telling me you cried because you let your friend down while feeling nothing every time you let your lord down let me tell you something allah has no need of you or any of us so you better start acting like you need him because one day you will need him
1872763 it is ahmad i weep for him i have had a hard life and never had the life of a proper child i was brought up in sin and i wasted so many years of my life in which i could have spent my timing worshipping allah all i ever wanted is to bring up a son worshipping allah so that i can replace what i have lost and look towards my lord allah on the day of judgment with my son in my hand and smile towards allah showing him most high my pious son whom i have brought into this world with the permission of allah look what we have done we have only turned towards allah now in our lives and our son is lagging behind what if he died now and goes to hell how can i live with that guilt my son my son
1872764 i am stopping you from leaving the house it is almost 9 00pm and we are about to eat dinner together
1872765 what i made a promise to mo that i will meet up with him tonight
1872766 it is late and we need to eat dinner why is it your brothers and sister are so obedient and not you
1872767 how dare you they worship allah they are doing well in their life look at you ahmad cant you see what you are doing to yourself
1872768 ah its my parents again they filled my ears again with all that religious rubbish
1872769 haha dont they have a life i mean allah says he is forgiving so as long as we believe in him we will all go to paradise as long as we dont harm other people
1872770 he is unconscious at the moment and is suffering from a dislocated shoulder we need to get him quickly as possible to the hospital to give him an urgent brain scan to see for any damage or clots to the brain
1872771 no just go home and ponder on what has happened tonight and think to yourself why this has happened
1872772 when i saw that car coming towards me i thought that was it i was going to die
1872773 my parents stayed up for me all those hours and continued their worship too allah
1872774 ah ahmad i heard that you are safe back at home thats why i decided to call you up
1872775 listen ahmad since that night was messed up and you could not go to the nightclub do you want to come down tonight i was so angry when you had that accident you should have seen the girls i chatted up at the club when you were brought to hospital
1872776 mo to be honest i really dont want to go say if this is a warning from allah
1872777 warning are you mad dont tell me you are becoming an extremist you know they have the most boring of lives
1872778 they may have a boring life now but they sure have everything when they die
1872779 come on ahmad we are muslims we will go to heaven ok we might be punished in hell for a little while but we will all eventually go to paradise so what is there to worry about besides allah is merciful he said if you believe he will forgive you
1872780 hmm i dont know let me think about it surely not tonight as my arm is still in a lot of pain but tomorrow i will give you the answer
1872781 ok dont forget to call me tomorrow i have to now sit down in this boring house and listen to my father reading quran man they have such a boring life i dont even know how they can smile
1872782 how can allah ever love me look what i have done i have never committed a minute of my patience and time for allah i have physically hurt my mother and yet she still loves me how can allah ever forgive me
1872783 if a sheik came into the room and saw you what would you do
1872784 but baba allah is watching you all the time and he is more pure than all the sheiks in the world
1872785 my father i have read your diary i changed you when i was a child through my questioning by the will of allah your words of your diary have turned me back to allah by his will and command
1872786 well i to be honest mo i am going to the masjid
1872787 listen mo you wont understand until you open your eyes
1872788 ha you can live your life in boredom ahmad but at the end of the day some day i will be in the same heaven as you and then you will regret not having fun now
1872789 we are in no situation to start interpreting hadith mo anyway do you really think that the people of paradise will regret not doing sinful things in fact it would be the complete opposite
1872790 ahmad its ok i see that you feel embarrassed but that is good it is better to be embarrassed than one who shows off
1872791 your father and mother would be really proud of you but most and best of all you have submitted your whole self to allah
1872792 i angered my parents oh sheik how can i make them happy
1872793 you have already made them happy when they see you now your father is very proud of you
1872794 i mean i want to get them something nice as a gift
1872795 hmm well you can get your mother some flowers or chocolate and your father some perfume maybe
1872796 write a small message to each of your parents and stick it on the gifts when you buy them
1872797 jazak allah kher sheik i cannot wait to get back and see my parents smile

1872804 oh allah no please i am a muslim i am a muslim
1872805 muslim do not degrade the name of muslim you disobeyed allah and you lived in denial of allahs punishment now you will suffer for now and forever
1872806 may allah curse you mo you guided me to this may allah give you a double punishment
1872807 i did not force you to sin you came to me willingly
1872808 if only i listened to ahmad on the road i may have been with him now
1872809 muhammad listen to me your son has turned back to allah i saw him crying so much in the masjid today he was there for about two solid hours all by himself seeking forgiveness i had a beautiful talk with him and he even bought you some gifts to try and please allah in making you happy best of all dear muhammad he pronounced the shahada before going and not only that but he saved an elderly muslim sister he looked up into the sky and smiled just before his breathing stopped take this

1872811 aliya aliya look at what our ahmad got for us

1872813 subhanallah lah he lah ha ilallah my son turned back to allah
1872814 ya rubb how can this be so beautiful in what i am seeing
1872815 oh ahmad you have seen nothing yet we have not even come close to the doors of eternal beauty
1872816 ya allah if i truly knew death was this bad i would have been your best servant please allah i now know please send me back and i will be the best
1872817 no more sound from you you said you were muslims yet you did not obey allah you were warned by your family yet you did not take heed you knew about hell and the punishment from allah yet it did not scare you to turn back to him this is your reward for choosing the life that you wanted you fell for your desires and you did not want to sacrifice the sinful fun for pleasing allah now you will face the pleasure for the sinful hell will be your abode now you will soon see the pious enjoying their lives within the garden of eternal delight see then and tell me what the real entertainment is the pleasure of the world that is now gone from you forever or the pleasure of paradise that will last forever see then and tell me who are those who show true happiness those sinful people on this earth looking to seek pleasure while the pious cry to allah or those who used to cry to allah now dwelling in gardens of eternal delight while those who tried to seek pleasure on this earth now screaming for eternity in the depths of hell fire
1872818 but the pain is too much i cannot bare it no more please take away some of the pain
1872819 pain you have not even felt pain you have seen nothing yet for you the terrors of the grave await you for you the horrors of the day of judgment are approaching and for you the final resting place of a pain and terror beyond your wildest imagination awaits it is jahannam the final abode for the disobedient servants of allah who underestimated his anger and punishment
1872820 there is a delay with their death certificates the time the parents are finished sorting that out the burial most likely will be on saturday anyway let us get going to the burial site
1872821 ahmad be patient for i cannot even imagine how you will act when you set foot within paradise
1872822 mashahallah those who are pious their dead bodies seem light since the soul wants to get into the grave while that of the disbeliever and the disobedient their bodies seem heavy since the soul does not want to enter the grave because of the horrors of what they see
1872823 yes inshahallah but words cannot describe the feeling of burying my own son
1872824 this is qadr of allah and this is surely a great test keep firm upon the path of the sunnah and quran and you will meet him again face to face inshahallah
1872825 please let me in i would love to see what is beyond those gates
1872826 be patient ahmad for you will one day be allowed to enter those gates for the gates and walls you see are the beginning of a paradise wider than the heavens and the earth a size you cannot even imagine a size you will never be able to perceive even when you step foot into paradise it is a land where your dreams will come true a land where no sadness or boredom is ever felt a land where only desires and happiness are fulfilled ask and you will be granted walk the lands of paradise and forever you will come across things beyond your imagination oh ahmad prepare yourself for you have not even seen beauty prepare yourself for a land of unbelievable joy but now prepare your eyes for the greatest of beauty a beauty beyond magnificence prepare yourself for the day you meet the creator of all allah subhanahuwataaalah who is well pleased with you
1872827 i cannot wait to meet allah but i am so ashamed to meet him because of the bad things i have done
1872828 do not fear him now and do not be shy for allah is also looking forward in meeting you ahmad
1872829 this punishment is for every time you touched a woman allah has forbidden you to touch
1872830 this is for the piercing you did upon your tongue and your belly tell me now with the pain you feel was it really worth it did you gain eternal pleasure did it wipe out every form of depression upon this earth
1872831 no please stop i only did it because i was tempted by it i was planning to get rid of it
1872832 your excuses are nothing but air you knew it was forbidden yet you denied your lord thinking that he will let you live only so you can live through your desires and then you hoped to grow bored of it know this those who want to enjoy their pleasures thinking that they will grow out of it the only thing that is growing is the torment and pain they will feel in the afterlife
1872833 of course you are ahmad this is your place of stay until the coming of the final hour
1872834 mashahallah so this is it no more sadness and worry i still cannot get over the excitement that there will never be any boredom sadness pain or worry
1872835 wait until we enter paradise and see the face of our allah
1872836 dear slaves of allah this is a small gift from allah to thank you for praising his name
1872837 well by dear son 10 years after your death we went to hajj it was the most exhilarating experience ever nothing could be compared to standing among all the muslims bowing down to allah while in salat al layl night prayer your mother and i made big dua to allah to grant us a place with you in the hereafter after coming back from hajj we were all in our car driving back home reciting quran when suddenly we were struck by a truck and we all died by the will of allah
1872838 subhanallah what is also shocking was when you mentioned 10 years it feels i was here for only a few days i thank allah so much that he has united my family with me
1872839 no more sadness no more division you were united upon the earth and were separated at death you have now united for the second time and unity will be for eternity you will be a family forever you will enter paradise together without end you will be loved by allah forever
1872840 mama dada and my dear brothers and little sister come and i will show you around for there is so much to show you in here and even with this i have only seen a fraction of what is in this hugh magical dome imagine what will be in paradise
1872841 a major step forward in our commitment to become the greenest technology company on the planet and establishes our leadership position for others in the industry and all other industries across the globe
1872842 the way energy costs are they are just not sustainable so for business to be competitive in the future we need constant supplies of green energy and so we are trying to enable that everywhere we can globally
1872843 it really worries me when companies claim they have achieved carbon neutrality when its really not possible
1872844 carbon neutrality is a large amount of greenwash computer companies should be focusing on the developments made in recent years in the reduction of harmful material inside the computers and reduction in the power that computers use with these high claims companies are setting themselves up to be knocked back down again
1872845 barclays has taken fewer writedowns than rbs but barclays capital is more risky than some of the other banks

1872887 well it lost money and it stunk on every objective measure but some folks sure had a real good time
1872888 although the court appreciates these policy arguments and has benefitted from their excellent presentation the court is not a policy making body
1872889 s taying one step ahead of blizzard is just about impossible
1872890 its also as mentioned before a bit disturbing from the standpoint of the way virtual world eulas integrate with copyright policy
1872891 the problem for the use of glider is wow in operation requires portions of the software to be copied to ram users dont own the software technically they are licensees and their use is restricted to use in accordance with the license that eula tos prohibits certain forms of use of the software and glider violates those terms hence the use of glider while playing wow copyright infringement
1872892 blizzard claims that the process ram is copyrighted and that copying that ram is therefore protected by dmca and that launching a process is the same as copying it
1872893 one wonders what more could be done to make clear that the purchaser is a licensee not an owner of the software
1872894 there is no evidence that blizzard has sought to bar third parties from developing competing games
1872895 add and remove objects can i create content most of the avatars clothing and objects were created by vendors working for google were also working with a small number of trusted testers vendors and creative agencies as part of a test for creating custom items we hope to enable user generated content and even more customization soon but until then weve given you tons of choices from the catalog to help personalize your lively experience
1872896 road america is such a great track it reminds me of the n rburgring nordschleife with its elevation changes and turns its very fast and very technical in terms of setup i expect that well run a pretty stiff car here its a fairly smooth track with lots of fast corners the setup is definitely more for high speed than at mid ohio which is a slower speed track we had a very strong car here last year and were on a winning race pace with the changes that porsche has made to the car over the last year i hope well have another fast car this year
1872897 in terms of strategy we need to consider that its a four hour race and the 4 plus mile track makes for a long lap we expect that well be able to run about one hour before needing to stop for fuel which would make it a three stop race barring any issues but we have to make sure that our fuel mileage calculations are exact its a long lap and a mistake in this area could cost us the race the long laps can also be an advantage though because we have more time to make decisions and more flexibility
1872898 in the past weve seen races here with a lot of cautions so we need to be prepared for that although its a big track and theres lots of passing room its also a high speed track and cars definitely push it here hopefully we wont have the weather problems that we did in 2007 heavy rain and thunderstorms but in the late summer weather is very changeable were cautiously optimistic that well have strong cars for the race we were competitive with the ferraris here last year and expect that to be the case this year i think the track definitely suits the strengths of the porsches
1872899 was mich wirklich besorgt ist doch dass beide volksparteien mitglieder verlieren die spd nur etwas schneller als die cdu eine lebendige demokratie lebt von menschen die sich engagieren in vereinen in initiativen und selbsthilfegruppen aber auch in parteien ich w nsche mir dass viele die oben vom trib nenplatz aus meckern runterkommen aufs spielfeld und sagen da mach ich mit frieden freiheit gerechtigkeit und sozialer zusammenhalt all das f llt doch nicht vom himmel

1872907 come down here to the hospital and we will check you out and if you are infact in active labor and the baby has not flipped we will be doing a c section today
1872908 but does this mean that as a loaded gun is only potentially explosive and an act of pulling the trigger is needed to make it go off so christs death only achieved a possibility of salvation needing an exercise of faith on our part to trigger it off and make it actual
1872909 social experts drum into us these days that the family unit needs to be stable and secure and that any unsteadiness in the parent child relationship takes its toll in strain neurosis and arrested development in the child himself the depressions randomness and immaturities that mark the children of broken homes are known to us all but things are not like that in gods family there you have absolute stability and security the parent is entirely wise and good and the childs position is permanently assured the very concept of adoption itself is a proof and a guarantee of the preservation of the saints for only bad fathers throw their children out of the family even under provocation and god is not a bad father but a good one
1872910 this one is especially nice it is surely meant to be for you otherwise i would have given it away along time ago

1872913 oh im sorry i dont have a warm and soft fur to give you i have to look after them or i simply wont have any left

1872919 it is time for a new approach to youth justice which both prevents crime and confronts young people with their actions if they do break the law
1872920 we need to make sure they face up to the consequences by having a victim led system of justice for young people which is less formal but actually in many ways more more shocking
1872921 because it really does change their behaviour if they are confronted with the consequences of their actions early on
1872922 what type of prevert do you take me for do you think id grow my hair out just to get laid
1872923 here we are all of a sudden in the 60th year after strom thurmond bolting the democratic party over a simple thing something almost unheard of because he did not want the armed forces to be integrated
1872924 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
1872925 you are showing two affluent black professionals where is the struggle where is the angst where is the message
1872926 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
1872927 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
1872928 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
1872929 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around

1872955 by the end of the 1980s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognize as homosexual by nature i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
1872956 i am deeply concerned by the pentagons inadequate response to sexual assaults on our troops and the administrations unwillingness to answer questions about this important issue
1872957 allow us to identify the necessary reforms to protect our service members from sexual assault

1873095 tapi saya cuma mengatakan hargailah keputusan hukum dan juga hak asasi manusia
1873096 ini masalah utang royalti yang merupakan penerimaan negara bukan pajak
1873097 sebaiknya bayar lunas dulu kewajiban royalti kalau mereka punya klaim restitusi pajak ke negara silakan diajukan tersendiri
1873098 jumlah royalti yang ditahan sama nilainya dengan pajak yang seharusnya dikembalikan pemerintah
1873099 kami akan melihat progress penyelesaian kalau lunas besok lusa pun akan saya cabut
1873100 ini piutang negara dan ada pihak ketiga yang menahan uang negara ini negara jadi harus ada prosedur
1873101 kami sudah menyurati mereka tapi mereka bertahan tidak mau menyelesaikan kewajibannya
1873102 pajak tidak mau mengembalikan uang restitusi pajak karena takut rekeningnya turun sedangkan direktorat kekayaan negara ingin penerimaannya naik
1873103 padahal kalau perusahaan membayar royalti dan pemerintah mengembalikan pajak semuanya selesai
1873104 intinya pajak yang seharusnya direstitusi pemerintah dianggap dibayarkan melalui royalti yang ditahan

1873115 tidak jangan demi yang jiwa khaulah berada di tangan nya engkau tidak boleh menjamahku karena engkau telah mengatakan sesuatu yang telah engkau ucapkan terhadapku sampai allah dan rasul nya memutuskan hukum tentang peristiwa yang menimpa kita
1873116 kami belum pernah mendapatkan perintah berkenaan dengan urusanmu tersebut aku tidak melihat melainkan engkau sudah haram baginya
1873117 ya allah sesungguhnya aku mengadu tentang peristiwa yang menimpa diriku
1873118 wahai khaulah sungguh allah telah menurunkan ayat tentang dirimu dan suamimu
1873119 sesungguhnya allah telah mendengar perkataan wanita yang mengajukan gugatan kepada kamu tentang suaminya dan mengadukan halnya kepada allah dan allah mendengar soal jawab antara kamu berdua sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar lagi maha melihat

1873140 you might think you need to imagine something 10 times or 100 times before it has an impact
1873141 our results show that even a single instance of imagery can tilt how you see the world one way or another dramatically if the conditions are right
1873142 are you relating going through heavy changes in touch with yourself and doing your own thing are you up front or just hung up and uptight
1873143 difficult to avoid and there is often an embarrassment involved in not using it somewhat akin to the mild humiliation experienced by american tourists in paris who cannot speak the native tongue
1873144 the street is not a refuse receptacle please dispose of your waste properly
1873145 so you are knowingly and willfully breaking the law and subjecting all of us to your filth
1873146 there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats
1873147 you can look at yourself from the street level or you can look at yourself from the satellite level other people see you from the satellite level so if you think of yourself from that big picture perspective youll tend to be more accurate
1873148 while we live our own lives under a microscope and we are present all the time when we do things other people are not there with us
1873149 thats a problem for intuiting other peoples thoughts because we tend to evaluate ourselves in much finer detail we look at ourselves from the street view whereas other people are looking at us from space
1873150 in the united states consumers are expected to spend 80 million this year on brain exercise products up from 2 million in 2005 advertising for these products often emphasizes the claim that they are designed by scientists or based on scientific research to be charitable we might call them inspired by science not to be confused with actually proven by science
1873151 memetics used to be a good science until blackmore took over
1873152 understanding ourselves is largely an effort to understand where we are headed understanding others is more of an effort to understand where they are
1873153 my pet peeve is the use of ocd in i get really ocd about cleaning my kitchen whats really offensive about the usage is that it suggests one can spontaneously develop and un develop a disorder this is offensive to people who actually live with mental illness daily unless its interfering with your functioning its not a disorder
1873154 using fetish to mean a fascination with rather than its true meaning causing sexual arousal
1873155 every time i hear someone misuse the term acting out i begin experiencing homicidal ideation of course acting out is a psychoanalytic term denoting the enactment of an internal dynamic in the external world you cant recognize the internal feeling states and so it is necessary to act it out but even among fully trained licensed clinical psychologists this term has come to mean behaving badly which of course makes it a useless term
1873156 since i am not a native english speaker i didnt come across someone calling me anal until i started to study in england at first i was shocked since i didnt immediately understand my friend was not referring to my anus but to my personality i dont think many people realize that they are referring to one of the personality traits emerging from the failure to successfully complete one of freuds developmental stages
1873157 two terms that i think are way over used and misapplied are extrovert contrary to what people seem to believe youre not one or the other and the huge lists of attributes that get attached to each term are by no means accurate for everyone
1873158 in every mental health job i have worked the real pain in the ass clients are referred to as borderline borderline has now ceased to be a disorder its psychobabble for this client is so annoying and needy i would gladly chew off my own foot to escape
1873159 the most irritating one is the word schizophrenia which is wrongly used whenever someone refer to split personalities i just cant hold myself back from being a besserwisser and telling them that they have no idea what schizophrenia is
1873160 when people describe themselves or others as being type a when in fact theyre nothing like what type a is supposed to be never mind the ridiculous dichotomy of dividing all human beings into having these collection of traits and not having these collection of traits
1873161 one of the richest sources of psychobabble is educational psychology particularly in the area of giftedness so we have
1873162 people dont talk about their emotions anymore they vent contrary to the psychobabble though people are not like steam engines
1873163 here are two glorious examples of psychobabble from the world of business socialize as in lets socialize that idea around the group and get some feedback translation lets let people know what our idea is and see if they like it and institutionalize as in once weve socialized our strategy and have gotten buy in from our sponsors lets make sure it gets institutionalized throughout the organization
1873164 after a traumatic event say the va tech shootings grief counselors parachute in to help the survivors witnesses move on my father died over 20 years ago i still dont have closure though i stopped grieving after what apparently was an appropriate interval his absence is an ongoing part of my life that i dont think will close
1873165 hardwired is surely one of the most abused terms in both science journalism and everyday language according to even usually quite reliable sources were hardwired for money risky behaviour religion feeling others pain art fraud oh and liking pink if youre a girl of course

1873175 tuannya hari hari di sisi allah adalah hari jumat dia lebih agung daripada hari raya idul fitri dan idul adha dalam hari itu terjadi lima perkara adam diciptakan allah adam turun dari surga menuju bumi adam diwafatkan allah ada sebuah waktu sedang seorang hamba tidak memohon kepada allah pada waktu itu kecuali dikabulkan permohonannya selama dia tidak memohon dosa atau memutuskan tali silaturahim bangkitnya dari kiamat tidak ada para malaikat yang dekat dengan allah atau langit atau bumi atau angin atau gunung atau batu kecuali mereka takut pada hari itu
1873176 shalat shalat yang lima waktu shalat jumat hingga shalat jumat berikutnya dan puasa ramadhan hingga puasa ramadhan berikutnya semua adalah pelebur pelebur dosa di antara waktu keduanya selagi dosa dosa besar dijauhi
1873177 sesungguhnya panjangnya shalat dan singkatnya khotbah menunjukkan pemahaman seseorang dalam agama maka dari itu panjangkanlah shalat dan singkatkanlah khotbah
1873178 apabila rasulullah saw berkhotbah kedua matanya merah suaranya keras dan semangatnya menyala bagaikan seorang panglima pasukan yang memperingatkan akan kedatangan musuh yang hendak menyergap di waktu pagi atau petang
1873179 khotbah rasulullah saw dititikberatkan pada pokok pokok keimanan yakni keimanan kepada allah malaikat kitab kitab para rasul dan saat berhadapan dengan allah di hari kiamat juga uraian mengenai surga dan neraka

1873183 wahai rasulullah demi yang mengutus engkau dengan kebenaran aku tidak mengobati kecuali dengan al fatihah
1873184 darimana kamu tahu bahwa al fatihah itu adalah ruqyah ambillah imbalan itu dan beri aku sebagiannya

1873222 is it possible that ebes are members of an advanced evolutionary level of life who are tending this planet as a garden might they be cultivating human li fe not as a food source but to give humans the opportunity to become through their choices potential members and contributors to the ebe s advanced level maybe we should be asking are we growing in the right way how should we conduct ourselves in the presence of these in dividuals and how should we conduct ourselves with each other what do we have to gain by treating ebes as hostile invaders what is the r eal purpose of these visitations since we seem to be far less advanced maybe the only way we can gain is by concluding they are here for our benefit

1873334 although the 2008 programme was aimed at photographers in southern africa we had applications from all over the continent
1873335 it really has shown us that we are hitting the nail on the head as far as the need out there among african photographers goes
1873336 although we have enjoyed some funding from the european union as part of our african image pipeline project we were seriously short of funds in running this programme so were limited in the amount of support we could provide for transport and living costs it has been amazing to me however that almost all of these photographers have made their own way here some coming as far afield as east africa and west africa
1873337 we can really see the entrepreneurial spirit in the extent to which many of these photographers are risking their own resources to reach out and take this opportunity and it is not just those from other parts of africa participants have traveled from joburg and cape town and we have two participants from durban who make their way by catching lifts and hitch hiking every morning long before dawn to make it here in time

1873345 londons roads it emerged yesterday are just as snarled up as they were before the congestion charge was introduced five years ago so was it a costly mistake quite the opposite the charge netted 137m last year and has cut the number of cars entering the central zone each day by 70 000 unfortunately road diggers and construction mean those who do drive in spend too much time in jams this is bad for pollution levels despite the crackdown on noxious vehicles that ken livingstones administration put in place it is frustrating for drivers but it is not an indictment of the 8 charge which remains the best way to deter cars from entering the capital

1873355 it could be true that they donations were made but as a part of a deliberate set up to make obama look bad aaron klein reports from the israel for wnd again obviously if an actual illegal donation was actually made it should be returned but it would be interesting to find out who really made it and why
1873356 by the way aaron klein is clearly an sic conservative anti obama reporter for the ultra right wing worldnet daily
1873357 their imagination in suggesting wnd actually set up the palestinian donations to the obama campaign
1873358 thats a good one it was an elaborate sting operation by an independent news source not feeding at the obama media trough says daily kos talk about your twisted convoluted conspiracy tales maybe wnd was also behind the forged obama birth certificate published by daily kos
1873359 making up these wacky stories shows the desperate lengths daily kos will go to deny their beloved candidate would do anything wrong
1873360 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
1873361 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza

1873372 the feeling in our party is that we are the ruling party and therefore we must maintain some power i mean real power

1873374 i think we might have a deal but from what i see this will be a forced settlement because none of those people will get what they really want so i foresee them agreeing but after some three to four months the new deal will collapse with one party pulling out complaining about something
1873375 right now all they want is to give the impression that they are all interested in saving this sinking ship will it last well i dont think so

1873398 opportunity is this the small fish big fish and fish farmers all want the same thing
1873399 is it that difficult for businesses to collaborate and should we not just let them get on and do it the reason this logic is faulty is that the vast majority of ad hoc business collaborations involving more than two parties fail miserably for three main reasons

1873415 it is written that the christ would suffer and on the third day rise from the dead and that in his name repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be preached to all nations beginning from jerusalem
1873416 by his own right hand god has now raised jesus up to be leader and saviour to give repentance and forgiveness of sins through him to israel

1873521 jawaban itu cerdas dan efektif untuk menggambarkan bagaimana dia menyatakan secara implisit bahwa dirinya merasa layak ditempatkan di posisi yang diincarnya pewawancara butuh jawaban seperti itu cukup singkat tapi menunjukkan optimisme yang alamiah
1873522 ketika itu saya tanya apa yang membuat anda memutuskan pindah kerja tadi anda bilang lingkungan kerjanya cukup nyaman kan dan pelamar itu menjawab saya tidak suka bos saya seringkali ia membuat saya jengkel dengan pekerjaan pekerjaan tambahan dan itupun tidak membuat gaji saya naik saya lalu berpikir apa yang akan dia katakan jika suatu saat keluar dari perusahaan saya tentulah tak beda buruknya dengan apa yang dia ungkapkan pada saya tentang perusahaan lamanya
1873523 saya menginginkan ritme kerja yang teratur dan terjadwal mengenai gaji sebenarnya di tempat kerja yang lama tak ada masalah tapi tentu saya senang kalau ada peluang untuk peningkatan gaji

1873566 yes im very interested in clothes you can usually tell a lot about people from the way they dress
1873567 there were two looks some of them were like very clean cut very simple
1873568 well you see that girl over there shes wearing just a tee shirt and a cardigan and a skirt but the a slightly different colour from the cardigan so it doesnt look like it matches too much and its only fastened by the top button which is kind of counter intuitive i mean why would you fasten a cardigan like that it looks simple simple but its actually simple complicated shes really thought about it thats why it looks good she probably wants you to think its simple simple that she just threw it on
1873569 thats complicated in berlin there were these simple girls just a t shirt and plain clothes very natural fabrics
1873570 yes no not so grunge and then there were the other girls very trashy like bright lipstick plastic stuff
1873571 yeah tall very and theyre all state registered thats why they look like that i was talking to one and she said they all used to dress like normal but now they dont have to and its become like a look
1873572 yeah she said 80 for a hand job or a blow job and and an erotic massage and she said she was proud to pay taxes and the fee also goes to pay the hotel
1873573 hey have you noticed how the girls in paris now all wear these very very low cut tops like everything hanging out

1873575 im sure ive seen him before i mean whats going on with her clothes hey
1873576 could be i was wondering that myself well shes wearing
1873577 well the girls in berlin looked a bit like that but different the girls here look like theyre just walking along maybe going to the market then theyre going to sit in this cafe and drink a 5 coke then theyre going to go home and write all about it on facebook and thats what theyre going to do all day but in berlin the girls look like theyre all on their way to work like theyre going to a couple from belgium came in and wanted them 90 each and they took them then and there and that was that

1873595 but i do first you feel so bad that your brain stops working you cant think about anything for a while so you dont worry about any of the things youd normally worry about you reach a kind of zen state then when you stop feeling bad you are happy to have survived its like a brain reboot

1873644 whenever were afraid its because we dont know enough if we understood enough we would never be afraid
1873645 yeah thats a pretty nihilistic view but i can respect it because ive wondered such things myself and arrived at the same conclusions
1873646 i mean why do we do things like exercise or read or wash our bodies even probably because we want to make the quality of our life a little bit better than it might be if we didnt do those things
1873647 yeah but if were just going to die why bother
1873648 sometimes i think that people that are born on a farm and die on a farm are just as happy as anybody else
1873649 thats true but i suppose it just has to do with ones viewpoint you can think that death is going to come and get depressed and not do anything or you can believe that death is coming no matter what you do and this is a reason to like kinda seize the moment and do everything you can while youre here not everything gets to exist a lot of factors came into alignment to bring about the person that you are at this very moment into existence a lot of seemingly unrelated factors ya know
1873650 let me take a picture of this this is priceless
1873651 hey can i have those back theres somebody else inside that i want to give them to i want to make her happy too
1873652 and people say theres no such thing as synchronicity when that sort of stuff happens all the time

1873654 as a result of the events of the last few days weve suffered self inflicted casualties that add up to almost a quarter of this batallions nco strength so im not asking you im telling you that you all have to shoulder part of this additional burdon until replacements can be found

1873657 just because you got the monkey off your back doesnt mean the circus has left town
1873658 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses and illicit trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media by 2015 we will need integrated and collaborative capabilities that can anticipate and rapidly respond to a wide array of threats and risks
1873659 our analytic professionals will collaborate with world class experts in academe commercial interests and think tanks all with similar knowledge and personal networks deep expertise will require broad access to open source information our unique collection results and a network of outside experts our understanding of the breadth and depth of policy intelligence doctrine and global situational awareness must match the depth of our analyses
1873660 by 2015 the intelligence community will be expected to provide more details about more issues to more customers
1873661 to carry out its mission in an increasingly turbulent and complex global environment the intelligence enterprise must
1873662 the opportunity now exists to tap into a vastly larger amount of expertise than was previously available to intelligence
1873663 i only try to solve existing problems not the ones you make up
1873664 hey you have nothing in common but she still wants to hang out so that is pretty cool

1873670 look you there christ died for me my good works would not stop you my tears would not appease you look you there there stands the cross there hangs the bleeding god hark to his death shriek see him die art thou not satisfied now
1873671 come all ye springs dwell in my head and eyes come clouds and rain my grief hath need of all the watry things that nature hath producd let evry vein suck up a river to supply mine eyes my weary weeping eyes too dry for me unless they get new conduits new supplies to bear them out and with my state agree
1873672 he sweat as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
1873673 at one tremendous draught of love he drank damnation dry
1873674 i have sinned god must punish me how can he be just if he does not then since he is just what is to become of me
1873675 the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth from all sin
1873676 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners
1873677 did this man die for sinners i am a sinner then he died for me those he died for he will save he died for sinners i am a sinner he died for me he will save me
1873678 nothing in my hands i bring simply to this cross i cling naked look to him for dress helpless come to him for grace black i to this fountain fly wash me saviour or i die
1873679 no christ has died that any man may be saved if
1873680 no my dear sir it is you that do it
1873681 then went all judea and were baptized of him in jordan
1873682 and do not call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he is in heaven
1873683 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
1873684 howbeit in vain do they worship me teachings for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of man full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition
1873685 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge i will also reject thee
1873686 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
1873687 and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make and image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name

1873826 i was concerned about the salesman because i thought he was getting ill he started sweating when i placed my orders for the diamond ring i thought he was having some sort of hysteria or delirium because the man even tried to kiss me over the counter he even held the jewelry shop door open for me when i left

1873865 i have not heard with any certainty of any sexual hookups made over the confessional although there are a fair few people on the confessional who claim to have achieved it
1873866 the reason this site hasnt worked as a personals service is that anyone who uses it that way is instantly suspect as the expression goes theres a big fat elephant in the room and its the fact that youve resorted to soliciting dates hookups cuddles sex on this site obviously theres something seriously wrong with you
1873867 i dont see why its a question of desperate enough people go to parties and leave with strangers why not take that to another level there is the anticipation how isnt that hot
1873868 have some experience in just meeting random people to hang out with on the confessional
1873869 personally i once saw a fellow advertise that he would be sitting in stevie reading a book wearing a grey shirt and that if anyone wanted to talk to him they could so i and a few friends went and met him it was pretty cool definitely a fun experience and he was a nice dude but i confess we didnt exactly become friends or anything out of that nonetheless it was a cool experience
1873870 a friend who said that when she was alone one night she managed to meet some folks through the confessional to take a walk with she said that was good
1873871 i think the other two are more complicated smoke buddies only require that you have one thing in common and are both not really obnoxious people
1873872 personally i think meeting up with people is one of the most redeeming qualities of the confessional its one of the reasons i choose not to delete it so far ive said in the past that i think ill move on to more benign projects for a while and one of the project ideas ive been tossing around is a website for obies to meet up with random people anonymously at any hour not necessarily to hook up but not necessarily not to but just to you know meet i think itd be awesome if more obies got out and just met some random other obies once in a while
1873873 el machismo est muy arraigado a pesar de que la mujer tiene en el sistema comunista te ricamente los mismos derechos e igual fuerza que el hombre pero china combina esos elementos introducidos con la revoluci n cultural con la visi n arraigada de que las mujeres son incapaces de crear algo importante
1873874 tiene que ver con la percepci n occidental del exotismo chino
1873875 una obra de contenido pol tico o carga sexual tiende a venderse mucho mejor porque el sello made in china todav a se liga a la estrella roja de la gorra de mao y la tem tica contrasta con esa idea por la misma raz n si la autora es mujer se le a ade otro valor y si ya pertenece a una minor a tnica todav a m s
1873876 es la viva imagen de la mujer en china abierta al mundo pero desnuda para hacerle frente
1873877 no existe esa corriente como tal en este pa s pero s hay grandes diferencias entre las obras que crean las mujeres y las de los hombres
1873878 en general nosotras buscamos transmitir sentimientos propios mientras que los hombres tienden a la cr tica social o pol tica quiz por eso el sexo est tambi n m s presente en el arte de mujer
1873879 aunque traducido a la cultura occidental donde la mujer busca su lugar con un arte rotundo que impacta en todos los mbitos de la sociedad y a veces resulta incluso m s musculoso que el masculino parezca que las mujeres chinas son sumisas y d biles no es cierto la evoluci n de la mujer en china ha sido diferente y quiz la introversi n adquirida durante siglos se refleja en un arte m s suave e intimista
1873880 un material que se asemeja mucho a la forma de ser de los chinos de ahora que chupan todo
1873881 no importa cu nto diga el gobierno que se abre al mundo la censura sigue al acecho y se ceba con la mujer

1873884 the way i see it if youre gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style
1873885 the publics position on cars is right now in flux and it will be in flux for the next five or ten years
1873886 five years ago the guy who drove a prius was a weirdo today thats very mainstream and the guy who has the suv is wondering how the hell hes going to unload it
1873887 th nk is of course like tesla a fledgling company and the viability of both is certainly questionable
1873888 theres lots of opportunities to screw up and ive seen both companies screw up a few times already
1873889 its proof of a concept and a way of generating interest
1873890 but to really make a difference we have to scale up drastically
1873891 some people said it was a fake a pr exercise
1873892 are small electric vehicles that can go 50 to 60 miles on an overnight charge
1873893 gm realizes they made a serious miscalculation when they killed the ev1
1873894 the only real question is whether the volt is too little too late
1873895 within a few years we hope to be producing hundreds of thousands
1873896 the last person youd expect to be praising gm but they are the most aggressive right now about actually doing and not just talking
1873897 you plug it in charge it and drive it the motor is virtually maintenance free
1873898 if someone came along today and proposed that you carry this highly inflammable stuff around just with a tank with a thin steel wall around it they would say you were crazy
1873899 to me its actually quite amazing that you can take a relatively small car smack it into a truck at you know 50 or 75 miles an hour and the gasoline tank doesnt just explode all over the place every time
1873900 and were doing everything we can to make that fewer
1873901 if you want to run longer and further on electric power alone it means a bigger battery it means charging a battery more fully and discharging it more completely and it means provisions for cooling or ventilation in order to give the batteries longer life
1873902 theres nothing going to come along and make the battery half the size in the near future
1873903 theres no huge breakthroughs on the horizon that will make a big impact on the chemistry but there are many variations on the chemistry to optimise the battery performance
1873904 theyre already approaching the theoretical limit of the electro chemistry
1873905 we can take all the power in or out of our battery in 10 seconds
1873906 you put that in a prius and it accelerates like a ferrari
1873907 although lower charged went much much more cycles and the rate of loss of capacity with each charge cycle was fairly low but today if you look at sonys iron phosphate and some of the others like sanyo theyre already a better battery than the a123
1873908 and without increasing its capacity at all just simply increase its cycle life by a factor of two youd have made a phenomenally good battery
1873909 capacity of batteries for the same volume and the same mass has increased historically 8 percent per year thats been true for 25 years now
1873910 im optimistic that over time the batteries will get cheaper and will get higher capacity in the same volume
1873911 the venture community here in this country has been investing like crazy in battery technologies
1873912 the best battery for the tesla is not the same as the best battery for the volt
1873913 when people say whats the best battery i would ask for what
1873914 only about half a dozen or a dozen are any good
1873915 and theres no loyalty in china everyone in that industry knows each other and theyre switching firms all the time and taking the technology with them
1873916 its no use expecting support from any of these companies unless you turn up at their door with a multi million dollar purchase order
1873917 you will be competing for their manufacturing capacity with the worlds major battery consumers orders under 100 000 are a nuisance
1873918 we know its very abundant and its even in the sea
1873919 maybe well have to figure out how to extract the lithium from seawater
1873920 if this market goes to a trillion dollars a year there will be bottlenecks
1873921 the u s is 3 000 miles wide with huge tracts of sparsely populated land
1873922 the mass market wont always be wary of full evs
1873923 that wariness is more a figment of the automakers imagination than reality tons of people would buy an ev right now if one was available we hear from them all the time
1873924 every time we park somebody wants to talk about the car
1873925 the battery technology is there to make this happen gm volvo mercedes nissan theyre all working on it
1873926 the plug in concept is so important because driving patterns in the u s support it
1873927 with even a 20 mile range you can do 50 percent of all your driving
1873928 although i also forecast an increase in battery ev demand
1873929 give the worldwide consumer five years of driving a plug in hybrid
1873930 and some of those drivers will realise that they actually never use the range extender and the next car they buy wont need it
1873931 but we have to determine how well does this hold up in the real world
1873932 if theres going to be a true plug in hybrid market were going to be there its just that thats a huge commitment to actually go to production
1873933 id like to believe theyll give us plug in vehicles but until i can go out and buy one im still sceptical
1873934 the corporations are sitting wishing this whole friggin thing to go away
1873935 exactly what the computer companies attitude was to personal computers
1873936 you cant make a real company out of converting somebodys cars
1873937 in this country an automotive manufacturer is required by law to warrant the entire emission system of the car for 100 000 miles and its probably the same where you are and once you change the electronics the computer thats controlling all that toyota is off the hook and suddenly you are on the hook you are liable so you can do that for your car and mine and your friends but if you make a business out of it youve got a problem
1873938 game changing energy storage technology is in the advanced stages of commercialisation
1873939 the key enabler of many clean technologies today renewable energy grid load levelling consumer electronics and security applications
1873940 if honda is desperate enough to foist an uncertain technology on a celeb who no longer attracts the limelight
1873941 it illustrates one unhappy fact whatever our transport solutions are they are still far enough off that absolutely everyone is hedging their bets
1873942 to a point where you can drive 700 million cars off it
1873943 the technology for batteries is a very very fast moving arena still and making swappable batteries forces standardisation its too early the technology is changing the voltage of the battery the charging rate of the battery the charging technique of the battery the physical size of the battery the inner connector of the battery communications with the battery all of these are moving targets
1873944 just about the time that swapping batteries doesnt make sense anymore because the battery packs are big enough
1873945 your cars performance will radically vary depending on what battery pack is in it at that particular moment
1873946 if you own it youre much more likely to take care of it
1873947 the more you commit the more of a rebate you get on day one
1873948 youd pay a certain fee for miles but the cost of the car would be subsidised and in some cases youd be getting it for free
1873949 its my goddamn electricity ill go and put it in my car i dont feel i should pay him anything
1873950 its the choice between renting a flat and buying a home
1873951 we figured out all the available volume for the battery pack and then we basically filled it like water with battery
1873952 the battery pack is the single most expensive and most dangerous component of the car no question about it and for that reason it needs to be very rigidly installed in the car so that bad things dont happen in a crash rigidly installed and highly protected and the question is you know can they make a system like that that can be realistically removed and replaced in a reasonable amount of time and where i can ensure that even with idiots at the changing stations that it gets installed correctly every time
1873953 the hardest part for us in making our car pass crash standards was making a the battery pack safe no question about it we were beefing up the brackets and holders so they would stay put and do what they are supposed to do in a crash and if you add on top of that the requirement that it can be quickly and easily removed and replaced its tricky
1873954 we want to spur an industry that will continue to build green power plants
1873955 50 000 cars represent a gigawatt of added standby power
1873956 youre not going to see all the cars start charging because they all got to work at the same time
1873957 we could have roughly 40 percent of american drivers powering their cars from electricity that is charged at night
1873958 by and large its people working for hedge funds that sort of thing theyre doing it for financial reasons not environmental ones
1873959 the enquiry level and the number of new customers initiating trials are buoyant
1873960 however we anticipate that due to the economic climate and the trading conditions our customers are experiencing it will take longer for these trials to convert into volume orders
1873961 the fact that tesla chairman elon musk owns a solar power and space launch company is at least potentially a perfect trifecta
1873962 when musk finally announces that space x will be launching solar panels into orbit to beam juice to a million gen3 evs
1873963 most of the fun is between 40 and 80 mph which is where you put your foot on it
1873964 the tesla shows sports cars can be electrifying the sports car neednt die once oil runs out
1873965 if you dropped somebody in from another planet and said this one with the petrol engine or this one with an electric motor well theyd probably say the tesla
1873966 but i dont feel i particularly need to go out and buy one
1873967 motor racing is all about the sound all about the noise all about the smell of the fuel all about the whole atmosphere
1873968 if you have electric cars you wont even have no atmosphere
1873969 evs are going to still be expensive things that only the rich can afford

1874027 before i was afflicted i went astray but now i obey your word you are good and what you do is good teach me your decrees
1874028 your word o lord is eternal it stands firm in the heavens your faithfulness continues through all generations you established the earth and it endures your laws endure to this day for all things serve you if your law had not been my delight i would have perished in my affliction i will never forget your precepts for by them you have preseved my life save me for i am yours i have sought out your precepts
1874029 oh how i love your word i meditate on it all day long your commands make me wiser than my enemies for they are ever with me
1874030 how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth i gain understanding from your precepts therefore i hate every wrong path
1874031 my heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end
1874032 you are my refuge and my shield i have put my hope in your word

1874147 sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must master it
1874148 not so if anyone kills cain he will suffer vengeance seven times over
1874149 and the lord put a mark on his head so that no one who found him would kill him
1874150 he was no more because the god took him away

1874187 and god was with the boy as he grew up
1874188 isaac prayed to the lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren
1874189 do you have only one blessing my father belss me too my father
1874190 it is because i saw god face to face and yet my life was spared

1874219 aku jelas sangat prihatin karena bagaimanapun balap sepeda jelas memberi potensi sangat banyak untuk mengharumkan nama negara dan juga pribadi aku kadang berpikir kenapa mereka terlalu terobsesi dengan itu semua
1874220 perlu kerja keras karena sepertinya kami kehilangan beberapa momen dalam 5 6 tahun terakhir dan ini sangat berbahaya bagi masa depan balap sepeda di inggris
1874221 sepertinya itu bisa menjadi solusi positif kini aku dan teman temanku yang peduli dengan hal itu bakal merintis mungkin setelah beijing kami akan berkonsentrasi
1874222 aku sangat ingat saat ayahku sampai cedera lutut untuk membuatku terkesima dengan balap sepeda
1874223 aku sudah berjanji pada diriku untuk meraih yang terbaik kalau bukan sekarang sangat mustahil empat tahun lagi aku bisa berada di puncak seperti yang kurasakan saat ini
1874224 rasanya langkah ini bisa membuatku semakin percaya diri karena aku tahu kapasitas alat yang kubeli dan ini biasanya berhasil membuatku semakin cepat di trek

1874226 as the new data comes undirected fabl of darwinian evolution becomes more and more tricky misinformation of the materialism this article belongs to my most favourite researcher mike gene who works on directed evolutionary processes called front loading here is the latest article on him you had better visit his site the design matrix to learn more about the concept of fron t loading

1874235 however the more theoretical question about the accessibility by darwinian evolution of irreducibly complex structures of functionally indivisible components if such exist has not been thoroughly examined one factor hampering examination of the accessibility of biological structures by darwinian evolution is the absence of a classification of possible routes a suggested classification is presented here
1874236 although it can generate complicated structures it cannot generate irreducibly complex structures
1874237 the arch is irreducibly complex and assuming that cement does not set instantaneously any arch one sees must therefore either have been built using scaffolding analogously to redundancy elimination or have been built elsewhere perhaps horizontally and moved into position when the cement had set analogously to adoption
1874238 first it will do no good to suggest that all the required parts of some biochemical pathway popped up simultaneously by mutation
1874239 by irreducibly complex i mean a single system composed of several well matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning
1874240 an irreducibly complex system is one that requires several closely matched parts in order to function and where removal of one of the components effectively causes the system to cease functioning
1874241 even if a system is irreducibly complex and thus cannot have been produced directly however one cannot definitively rule out the possibility of an indirect circuitous route as the complexity of the an interacting system increases though the likelihood of such an indirect route drops precipitously
1874242 whenever hsp70 was present in a genome hsp40 and grpe were also found if enough sequencing was done conversely genome sequencing has demonstrated that if the hsp70 gene is absent hsp40 and grpe are also absent
1874243 to feel the full force of the conclusion that a system is irreducibly complex and therefore has no functional precursors we need to distinguish between a physical precursor and a conceptual precursor darwinian evolution requires physical precursors
1874244 we have seen that living things are too improbable and too beautifully designed to have come into existence by chance how then did they come into existence the answer darwins answer is by gradual step by step transformations from simple beginnings from primordial entities sufficiently simple to have come into existence by chance
1874245 so how can the whole process have arisen step by step as required by gradual evolution it certainly is impossible to believe that these complex sequential processes arose all at once so we must look for a different format for a start we must assume that there was a more direct method of synthesis available at one stage indeed that a more direct process might still be available in some creature yet to be investigated as i have suggested in the case of adenine then we must go on to surmise that the intermediate stages are refinements interpolated subsequently
1874246 if you look at bacterial flagella you find that some are indeed quite complicated but others are more simple
1874247 it is likely that as new bacterial genomes continue to be sequenced at the rate of about one a month organisms will be found which require even fewer genes to make a completely functional flagella

1874249 a kyodo news reporter as directed let himself into one of the hotel rooms in which slogans were daubed on the walls condemning chinas human rights record a chair and furniture were overturned and a dummy with a black bag on its head was posed in a seat apparently symbolizing a political prisoner
1874250 journalists also received messages summoning them to two hotel rooms in beijing containing dummies splattered with red paint
1874251 meanwhile four hotel rooms around the city were used to stage protests over the detention of chinese dissidents protest organisers played a cat and mouse game with security forces sending text messages to journalists to rendezvous at hotel rooms where keycards had been left strapped inside the doors daubed on the walls were slogans in red to represent blood saying one dream one nightmare together with the names of dissidents held in china and tibet on the beds were dummies with mock blood seeping from checked shirts

1874385 gsk took the responsibility to examine the existing body of clinical data available to us as soon as we learned the results of the d a d cohort

1874400 the start of the hefh study puts us on track to meet our goal of beginning four new mipomersen studies this year in addition the recent patent issuance increases the overall value of mipomersen which we believe has enormous potential to help patients
1874401 this is an exciting moment for mipomersen combining the initiation of the phase 3 trial in hefh with a very broad patent allowance that expands the patent coverage for the apob franchise
1874402 this comprehensive patent covers methods of inhibiting apob by targeting anywhere on the messenger rna including the site to which mipomersen binds and all therapeutic uses that might result from lowering apob

1874414 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimised for that obviously
1874415 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognising an ssd with a 4kb sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512kb sector size
1874416 the cost per gigabyte of a 2 5 inch ssd is something like five times that of a hard disk drive

1874422 wouldnt necessarily hold views on foreign policy that are not identical to the government
1874423 i think if you have got groups that are actively promoting violent extremism groups that are on record as saying israel should be wiped off the face of the map justifying suicide bombing then i dont think it is right for ministers to be engaging with them sharing platforms and giving them credibility
1874424 part of the challenge is how do we ensure that those young people who are angry about injustice about poverty about all of those things how do we ensure that they can channel some of that anger through democratic means
1874425 thats part of my task to try and build the voices of young muslims of women to make sure that they have more representation in public life and they actually do feel that the democratic systems work for them

1874446 baby boomers looking for jobs in growth fields that welcome older workers will want to dust off their diplomas rather than their treadmills according to a
1874447 boomers will probably want to work longer than earlier cohorts but their continued work requires that employers hire and retain them employers value older workers for their maturity experience and work ethic but worry about out of date skills and high costs slower overall labor supply growth may increase demand for older workers if employers can easily use older workers to do the work once done by younger workers future jobs will require less physical demands and more cognitive and interpersonal skills trends that favor educated older workers but job opportunities for less educated older workers may remain limited

1874466 we have a rich literature but sometimes its a literature too ready to be neutralized to be incorporated into the ambient noise this is why we need the writer in opposition the novelist who writes against power who writes against the corporation or the state or the whole apparatus of assimilation were all one beat away from becoming elevator music

1874478 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
1874479 if there is a silver lining in all of this its that users will become more aware and more consious of who they do business with
1874480 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
1874481 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
1874482 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited
1874483 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
1874484 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades
1874485 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
1874486 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
1874487 we have been trained since we were young to lock the door to our house our car we take these sensible security measures in the environment we are functioning in
1874488 it gives me great pleasure to announce this milestone in a scheme which honours every adult who helped defeat the evils of nazism
1874489 this is a generation which faced incredible hardship and loss and demonstrated tremendous bravery both on the battlefield as well as on the home front it is entirely right that those who endured these times to guarantee our liberty and security should be given the privilege of free passports
1874490 i am pleased the government has thought to recognise the hard work and sacrifices my generation made during the war in this way and would encourage as many people as possible to take advantage

1874492 its the choice between strong and stable leadership and chaos and disunity
1874493 its a choice between a government with a strong record and plans for the future or a man who spent the last few years planning for his retirement
1874494 the greatest risk we face is a change of government

1874496 incoming data has offered arguments both for a cut given the impression that consumers have hit a brick wall and a hike with actual and pipeline price pressures clearly visible

1874509 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1874510 i hope this will put the public eye and public pressure back on the case for a public inquiry
1874511 i think watching the performance anyone who left and didnt believe we should have a public inquiry would have been very few and far between
1874512 i think the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again it really gave me the wind under my wings to get going again because as was also portrayed in the play you do get tired you do think where else have we got to turn
1874513 i think its not over until its over and its not over yet
1874514 its something we need as it brings it back to the forefront again that the families are still here that they are still trying to fight for justice
1874515 if the show only moves us a millimetre towards a public inquiry then it is a success there isnt any other goal
1874516 it is like the condensation of 13 years of your life revealed to you in one and a half hours and even though you know the story its the intensity of that you even then start thinking this is bad and then you remember its about you its weird
1874517 wonder and comprehension illumination and darkness loss and possession abasement and bliss
1874518 it is part of our strategy to build a national network
1874519 the margins are so thin in the business its all based on volume every penny you can save its worth it
1874520 there are cost saving benefits to going national in other markets that has been a proven and very successful direction what youre seeing now in the canadian market is that same mentality
1874521 ultimately a rebranding is probably a good thing for stores that are struggling to compete in a hyper competitive grocery industry
1874522 it just might take some time to see the benefits as consumers and especially grocery shoppers are creatures of habit

1874555 but eventually we took a look at it and said okay
1874556 unfortunate because we absolutely want people to be moving into the downtown
1874557 after talking to some of the people this is how i feel and i always say what i feel good or bad
1874558 my feeling is that targeting athletes has happened im sure the administration may have a different opinion

1874565 i would hope that we can continue to work with the organisers to police the site in a way that satisfies both ourselves and the people attending
1874566 they did not express an interest to come on the site for the first 24 hours and then they came on the site with violence seizing essential health and safety items
1874567 they have told us they are willing to accept that two officers can be on the site
1874568 i cannot exclude electricity from my thinking when i think of making any plans i have to factor the lack of electricity
1874569 we cannot work without electricity because generators are not dependable
1874570 when i decided to purchase an updated model of my bakery i did not think of electricity
1874571 i could not operate it at all because of the inconsistency of electricity the bakery needs stable power it cost around 45 000 dollars now im ready to sell for 20 000 dollars
1874572 now the province gets power from iran under a contract signed about two years ago between the iraqi government and iran
1874573 it is supposed to build voltage regulators each 100 kilometres from the border to the province to avoid loss in the power
1874574 there is another line of power from iran which is being worked on and should be finished within a month
1874575 this will have a great effect on the improvement of the voltage and increasing the hours given
1874576 some houses burnt down because of the extremely high voltage from these
1874577 scientists will be shocked to see what iraqis are doing it shows how much people are suffering
1874578 the shortage of rain which last winter was 30 percent of what it was in previous years has led to an obvious impact on water levels in the tigris and euphrates and their tributaries
1874579 the lack of water from irans al wand river and from the darbandikhan dam in the kurdistan regional government krg has caused lake hamrin to lose nearly 80 percent of its capacity

1874589 todays boe rate announcement will be a non event as the bank is forced to keep rates high in order to fight inflation

1874593 i want to assume the responsibility for all this controversy
1874594 it was not their fault because i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily the responsible one for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1874595 i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness
1874596 and before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want

1874618 there is an anti blogging trend amongst some politicians who view the medium with suspicion and would rather it went away
1874619 the risks involved with blogging are much the same but the benefits are great too
1874620 why would any politician turn down the chance to get their views across unedited to hundreds of people each day
1874621 i am able to use my blog as a campaigning archive to pursue themes over a period of time and to debate them with those who wish to comment on the posts
1874622 i have used it to generate news stories in the dead tree press and i have made use of the opportunities it provides to advance internal arguments within the party as well
1874623 between them they add to the sense of debate about the country and its future something that is missing on the mainstream media

1874681 i like this idea of a fictional music i would form mental images of the little cold chapel where bleu vesp ral could be recorded in a tales time and bringing this apparition just by quality of sounds you just have to believe it or not it is fictional like a little colored landscape in a illumination
1874682 allora cari giornalisti esimi e cari economisti or vi avvedete che se i servi non han di che comprare finirete con il baratto dei vostri bulgari gioielli con il persian caviale pensavate di essere parte della casta o pennaiuoli arguti e in molti vi avventaste a cercare di prendere un boccone da quel giornale che pi pensaste fosse vicino a quel fuoco del potere dove bruciavano gli scrupoli e gli ideali di una generazione da seppellire in fretta ora pochi son tra voi sembra quelli che ancora godono degli antichi privilegi e molti i precari cos forse per questo che si affacciano questi problemi nelle prime pagine o forse soltanto per poterci fare confusione sopra parlane tu prima che ne parli qualcuno che possa farci chiarezza rimescola bene tutti gli argomenti e fanne un minestrone cos che quando qualcuno voglia scriverne con qualche concretezza tutti siano convinti di saper gi tutto e non abbiano capito niente avendone sentito se non il gusto almen lodore

1874706 what is it that we could have done to avoid such as crisis
1874707 we have a great new studio here at doublesix fantastic people exciting projects a good atmosphere some amazing ideas and best of all its fun to work here
1874708 i dont know where we would buy that but now that were stranded here outside of the cave im wondering how exactly is it that there is a limitless supply of frozen game in the cave ive always just taken it for granted
1874709 uh could we stop with the gods already who in particular
1874710 where did you read this i dont think ive ever heard of this before
1874711 wait youre giving me a narrative interpretation but youve seen this as a movie in your mind
1874712 well yeah sort of im learning a vision and a narrative i mean i cant present the vision that easily to anyone so i have to start somewhere this is like a summary in narrative form ok can i just continue with the story form its a lot easier
1874713 the hidden fire was drawn out from the mist to the back of the cave melting rock a great glacier was formed around the deer in a fury the deer were engulfed in a snow storm while lava flowed deeply into the earth and under the ocean with all heat gone from the deer they became rocks
1874714 well ok then were having banana ice cream potato chips and wine for dinner
1874715 youre really going to like this place i have our tickets lets go in

1874719 chlo s climbing in the window as i come as i come
1874720 zawmbyees sailing through the window sailing through the window and
1874721 doug is climbing in the window as i come as i come
1874722 isnt this great geez it was such a challenge to balance out the ladder in the middle of the floor it serves now as a kind of central sculpture until its utility is demonstrated but zawmbyee is the one who made the perfect placement for the couches and added her spectacular ironwork spiral staircase to the stars it reaches up like a tree that never quite touches the moon though the birds are quite happy to rest on a branch that is somewhat lower than heaven
1874723 does anyone really believe this drivel i mean it is just a hunk of metal
1874724 yeah i know but you have to let the nouveau riche enjoy their elitist status
1874725 youre an exception to every rule you do add a
1874726 thanks youre quite skillful hiding in french phrases but i guess i dont know what does it huh
1874727 you two are both grand sculptures of joy however you want to define it i think you both did a great job with a difficult space
1874728 creates that reaction theyre purging their emotions and releasing some energy but anyway dont worry about that youll enjoy the introductory experiential when the crowd clears you can go down
1874729 you really ought to fix that so you dont have to keep the door latched up
1874730 were working on a plan for a regular staircase zawmbyee
1874731 you dont have to remove your shoes i just did that because heels are hard on ladders
1874732 welcome to introduction to mystical quirks i will demonstrate to you today that thoughts penetrate into surprising places we will learn a little bit of psychometry from the greek psyche this means we will endeavor to measure and interpret the soul of objects the theory of operation is unknown but thoughts and emotions seem to embed themselves at some level into material objects is it at some quantum level i dont know by what principle of action does it occur i dont know psychics get into a lot of trouble by proposing speculative and flawed theories about what they do which are easily shot down and ridiculed by physicists however psychometry works and has been demonstrated to work although the mode of operation is unknown before we begin let me emphasize that the reception of information comes through the subconscious we will do a meditation to quiet the ego yes a question
1874733 dont we have to think rationally at all times to overcome the meanderings of our emotions which wander into unsubstantiated feelings about what is true there has to be a rational explanation for everything doesnt there
1874734 sir may i borrow your ring for a minute im just going to hold it in my hand and then ill give it right back to you
1874735 i get it i get it but its a lucky guess can i have my ring back please
1874736 dont worry just focus on a star that is still rest there and enjoy
1874737 you are now receptive to the ineffables of connectedness let the music be mystery a tide of being
1874738 we will continue but hold onto your receptivity those of you who need to please open your eyes i am going to pass around a hat i want you to remove something that you wear often a watch a ring or something else and place it in the hat alright pass the hat along and put something in it
1874739 im going to mix this up and pass this around again i want you to select an item at random take it in your hand and infuse yourself into every atom of its being
1874740 hold the object in your hand close your eyes and allow an image or a dream to appear at this moment dont try to interpret it just observe
1874741 ok you can be first what is your first name

1874745 are we having a problem i see a hand yes and you are
1874746 ok try putting it on close your eyes and try again everyone quiet lets give chlo a few moments to meditate

1874749 well ok this might be a good time for an intermission well come back to this

1874752 ill try uh well let me rewind to the beginning
1874753 you are the hip of curvaceous beats you lifted me into jumping so high i thought i could dance like a plane down a runway and take off i am surprised i did not hit the ceiling
1874754 you are not a bird and cannot fly i am a bird
1874755 yes you are a pretty bird we love you pretty bird awaken into us
1874756 im done with ngheufel lets have some garlic lime chicken
1874757 my mother said that wine made her sleepy but she was a liar she got silly she got high she denied she had inhibitions she denied she had ambitions i toast in praise of intoxication when a shy one can say i love you without a blush or a stutter and the foolishness is harmless poetic exuberance gee i always wanted to use exuberance in a sentence i think ive done it
1874758 you can be so elegant and um ill drink to that
1874759 well we dont have a drawing room so for dessert doug why dont you read us a poem
1874760 about intoxication and the toast did you want to say something doug
1874761 you should crash here ive got a baby doll nightgown you can wear ill show you
1874762 can you clear the table thanks and can you find us some cheese and crackers and some wine on a tray
1874763 put the tray down over here and take off your shirt and jeans i think its bedtime and you dont need any pajamas
1874764 you have the anchovies doug i know you like them
1874765 i think ill wait until tomorrow to tell you what i think i saw and
1874766 the land will be nude like your head and the ice will descend
1874767 please be advised that passengers are subject to random searches also please take note if you see a suspicious package report it to a transit worker or the police if you see something say something and have a nice day
1874768 oh ah oh ah oh ah mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
1874769 because here i am an arrow in your bow that you fling like a beau in a sling i am here outrageous to think of joy juliet when you are of class and i am pupil enlarged to see thee
1874770 am i not the feathers on your arrow that makes your flight run true to rise as the sun when i am the moon
1874771 whoa young lovers doth thou not trample on lines the planets forbid
1874772 this is a pleasant surprise would you like something to drink or a piece of garlic lime chicken
1874773 yknow i think that doth is third person but thou is second person
1874774 modern english is hard enough and ancient english appears to be only for thee chlo if you would be the objective case but you are strong like a nominative and as i understand it wherefore means why not where so thou art not an object but the subject of admiration by some romeo oh that makes it an object fixated on red hair and the art of the hunt feed him love and his growling will turn into ferocious purrs in basso profundo the roar of gratitude when the bosom of welcome is safely calm romantic but real and fun
1874775 you are already a ferocious spirit who has learned every lullaby that calms every hurt who could resist your song and gentle touch
1874776 could you just let me be diplomatic and vague please
1874777 zawmbyee ive gotten you and doug a full pardon so its safe for you to come back into the cave
1874778 well its a little complicated i have agreed to give a substantial number of ingot bars of gold platinum and palladium to zusoiti from the tzalbihuki on condition that she personally come out of the cave and open up a bank account in her own name
1874779 isnt that worth a fortune and wont it make her more powerful
1874780 its a gamble but im counting on the fact that she knows nothing about the tax laws and will be raising a lot of red flags the more ostentatious she is in her spending the better im pretty certain that the temptations of the up top world will seduce her considering how isolated shes been as a dedicated hermit and cave person
1874781 the gods left a stockpile of supplies an endowment you might say as varishynahuki guardian of the endowment i can distribute it as i see fit but it is a tricky business weve spent years setting up sham mining companies and businesses to hide our true source of income one must not tell the irs that one has obtained gold from the gods
1874782 chlo zusoiti is a dangerous person i dont think you want to know too much it is she whose thoughts and feelings you picked up at the blue attic club just her imprints nearly overwhelmed you oh and by the way zusoiti agreed to keep her friend ngheufel out of the club
1874783 well first i want to say zawmbyee and doug that you must vote in the coming elections for the parliament and for the grand council
1874784 well vote her out of power if you can find a reliable source of scuba diving equipment were going to need a lot of it because a lot of the voters cant hold their breath anymore
1874785 doug i think you can figure it out you know the tzvaleubhoi there are a lot of elders there on our side but they must appear in person to vote
1874786 well its been charming to meet you chlo doug i have to get going just get me some scuba catalogs and some books on how to scuba dive ok
1874787 i will um uncle utcoozhoo did you know that chlo is my favorite interior decorator
1874788 uh well i did the blue attic club with zawmbyee
1874789 hmm i might have some work for you in the future im going your way can i give you a lift home
1874790 sure and tell me all about the caves from what zawmbyee has been telling me it sounds intriguing
1874791 well then well be going thanks doug zawmbyee you look beautiful today see ya in the cave bye
1874792 all of this has been exhausting and i guess utcoozhoo can handle everything but
1874793 no i dont mean that i think that zusoiti really intends to trigger a new ice age
1874794 i think so utcoozhoo has told me a little about the pfayohiqusi im not sure exactly how but i think its powerful enough to trigger catastrophic climate change
1874795 are you sure about that or is it one of those exaggerated myths
1874796 no i think its real ive seen the pfayohiqusi do spectacular things but special permission is needed to use it
1874797 oh pfayohiqusi just means apparatus of the gods its just another one of those vague words that doesnt really tell you anything utcoozhoo throws these words at me but i havent yet comprehended what it really means

1874815 theres a candle burning in the world tonight and a heart is broken another prayer in vain
1874816 i am not in the slightest bit interested in any other woman than you
1874817 well of course im going to look especially if a girl thrusts hers straight into my face
1874818 i am not enough for you then nature just did not make mine big enough on their own to satisfy your manly urges
1874819 the words you are struggling to avoid saying are small tiny minute diminutive
1874820 i dont want to find that you suffocated under all that sagging fat
1874821 i gather that we are going to make port tonight
1874822 there is only the one river daniel and this boat is going only the one way
1874823 there are two ports of call on the way to slarn
1874824 it takes another three days to reach bretin where we shall stay moored for a day followed by another four days of travel to reach slarn
1874825 that makes slarn another ten days away for us nine if you dont count today
1874826 the three boats on this route spend four days in boathaven and five in slarn which means they are on a thirty three day round trip cycle the three sister ships are running eleven and twenty two days out of alignment with each other and never end up in the same dock together except in the winter months when they all hole up in slarn is that clear enough
1874827 i think i need to see a timetable but ill take your word for it
1874828 what it would be like if we set those ancient water gates at slarn so that we could sale this boat all the way to delbon can you imagine the king of delbons surprise when we sailed the steam dragon into the royal docks they havent seen a boat of any kind there for over a thousand years
1874829 i seem to remember that king ren alhey has put a price on your head for killing a few of his guards
1874830 pfft hell have forgotten about all that by now that was over a year ago
1874831 just the same way that king trep in bagdor will have forgotten by now how you blackmailed him out of all that money
1874832 well no he wont not in his case but the man is a toad and his children are worse did i ever tell you about the time i left more than a few whip marks on his son when he tried to rape me
1874833 its a nice idea though there must be other towns weve never heard of along the route between the delbar heights and the northern forest
1874834 they must have been abandoned centuries ago because i never heard of them at school in bagdor
1874835 too near the territory of your fairie friends i expect they dont like humans to gather in large numbers in their forests
1874836 what have you done with a certain ring i had in my pocket when i healed hala
1874837 its all right daniel i have it hidden in my money bag
1874838 you just thought it would be safer with you than with me
1874839 you were unconscious and alone it wouldnt have been safe to leave it with you
1874840 yes it must have been wonderfully safe in your pocket as you clambered over to that shipwreck and swung across between it and here on ropes far safer than staying locked in a cabin with me
1874841 there is no need for you to ever steal from me
1874842 does gally sorn know that the prince is on board
1874843 i did not tell her she may recognise him if they meet but i would doubt it those two have moved in very different circles
1874844 our two young heroes are trying to get some of their property back from sorn she didnt ask you to keep anything safe for her did she
1874845 she has given me nothing unless you count the aching back i got from servicing her needs last night the woman is sexually insatiable
1874846 the things a spy must do for his city are great indeed i could put in a word to get you a medal when this is all over the order of the rampant cock perhaps
1874847 if she ever finds out i am spying on her she will cut mine off and make me eat it before she kills me
1874848 the ones from the swallow were brought aboard and are perfectly safe in hold one as far as i know should i go and check on them
1874849 have you discovered how sorn plans to doublecross the traders that was your primary task for me in all this
1874850 with only three of them left she might well just take the swords and laugh in their faces she has said nothing of her plans to me
1874851 you must learn to pump her for information as you are pumping her in other ways i have been told she responds well to flattery
1874852 i have been told she cuts out the tongues of those who ask her unnecessary questions
1874853 i risk my life enough for you as it is
1874854 keep me informed if you see sorn do anything unusual or if she spends longer with someone than might be considered socially normal we will meet here again at the agreed time
1874855 yes or to do something we wont want to know about with him
1874856 we would make terrible parents daniel because i really dont care what they do
1874857 we did all right with the last lot of children we got lumbered with
1874858 gally sorn could have hidden the dagger and ring anywhere where do you think we should look next
1874859 the captains cabin is the most obvious place the trouble is that it is just below the bridge and it is relatively small i got into sorns suite from above because i could stay well over to one side of the boat im much more likely to be discovered if i attempt the same path for the captains cabin because i would be going over the side straight in front of the bridge
1874860 sorn might take them with her if she travels into wegnar once we have docked tonight
1874861 i think it would be better if we dont try anything tonight and go into the town to look around instead
1874862 i shall go out to earn the money we need to live and you can go and do whatever it is you do just so long as it does not involve the services of any big breasted women

1874873 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
1874874 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
1874875 mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
1874876 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
1874877 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
1874878 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1874879 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1874880 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
1874881 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year
1874882 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person as a player weve accomplished a lot of good things with chad he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything hes done
1874883 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want

1874893 writing has laws of perspective of light and shade just as painting does or music if you are born knowing them fine if not learn them then rearrange the rules to suit yourself
1874894 a musician must make music an artist must paint a poet must write if he is to be at peace with himself what a man can be he must be this is the need we may call self actualization referring to a persons desire for fulfillment namely to the tendency to become actually what we are potentially
1874895 feelings of limitless horizons opening up to the vision the feeling of being simultaneously more powerful and also more helpless than one ever was before the feeling of ecstasy and wonder and awe the loss of placement in time and space with finally the conviction that something extremely important and valuable had happened so that the subject was to some extent transformed and strengthened even in his daily life by such experiences
1874896 ich habe in der vergangenen nacht stundenlang mit meiner freundin telefoniert
1874897 because of what happened at pebble hills and weather conditions i felt it was important for administration to prepare a plan to check all the other schools for the safety of the children
1874898 keadaan ini menimbulkan masalah besar kepada penduduk terutama pada waktu pagi sebab waktu itu adalah waktu yang paling sibuk bagi kami semua ketika itulah ibu ibu sibuk menyiapkan sarapan pagi untuk anak anak yang bersekolah dan juga suami yang pergi bekerja pada waktu itu jugalah anak anak mempersiapkan diri untuk ke sekolah ketiadaan bekalan elektrik pada waktu ini amatlah merumitkan segala urusan keluarga
1874899 kami sangat kecewa dengan sikap pihak pihak terbabit yang tidak bersungguh sungguh untuk membantu kami sebab itu kami meminta bantuan pihak lain pula untuk membela nasib kami
1874900 ini kerana sebelum ini rakyat sudah puas meminta bantuan daripada pihak pihak berkenaan tetapi gagal atau langsung tidak dilayan permintaan mereka akhirnya rakyat bertekad untuk menyalurkan permasalahan mereka kepada pakatan rakyat pr sebagai saluran alternatif rakyat
1874901 ini merupakan sebahagian kecil masalah rakyat yang sedang kita tangani sekarang ini sebenarnya masih terdapat banyak lagi isu yang membabitkan kepentingan rakyat sedang dalam proses untuk didedahkan sedikit masa lagi
1874902 something must be done fast as the actual situation is a serious cause for concern
1874903 the aca must be given more resources to work with including an increase in budget by the government it is about time to seriously consider recruiting foreign officers to work with the aca on a contractual basis to solve more cases
1874904 we should perhaps look at emulating the success of hong kong which has done very well in curbing corruption
1874905 on an average the hong kong government spends close to rm40 per capita on anti corruption efforts in malaysia the sum is just a mere rm5 per capita
1874906 so it is time the government looked seriously into the problems affecting aca and work out a solution even if rm1 billion is spent on improvising the aca the government will actually be saving rm 9 billion
1874907 at present there is less than satisfactory public confidence in the aca it is about time the aca is free from the control of the pms office as this will ensure greater transparency integrity and accountability
1874908 hong kong is a small one state country but we are bigger so we cant be compared to them
1874909 we cannot investigate all the cases that were reported because some were anonymous letters poison pen letters and tip offs from even government servants
1874910 we did investigate all those cases which we could and left no stones unturned in our investigations
1874911 we are constantly striving to be the best and it doesnt matter under whom we work
1874912 the truth is no longer talked about the important thing is the perception
1874913 so much so that it had become word of mouth and they resorted to exaggeration the people must be appeased so as not to have any fear of a possible shortage of food they must be pacified so as not to have any worry over their own safety and that of their families
1874914 there is no more regard for statements of truth in law little attention is given to ones demeanour in life the sovereignty of the rulers is turned into an issue truth is not appreciated what is appreciated is the perception and along with it the lies
1874915 bathing water in england is getting better and that preparations must now be made for the new more stringent bathing quality standards which will come into effect in 2015
1874916 memang cadangan membabitkan tentera untuk membantu polis itu dibuat atas nama ketenteraman awam tetapi hanya orang yang tidak cerdik sahaja yang akan percaya kerana semua orang tahu bahawa kemelut dan kebimbangan sekarang hanya dirasai oleh parti yang memerintah yang bimbang mereka akan kecundang dengan silat politik dato seri anwar ibrahim dan rakan rakannya dalam pakatan rakyat
1874917 mereka mesti berkecuali dan membiarkan orang politik bertarung di dalam gelangggang
1874918 di dalam senario itulah maka yang di pertuan agong yang pada keadaan biasa hanya menjalankan peranan yang formal dan simbolik perlu mengambil pendekatan yang berani dan drastik kerana baginda adalah satu satunya benteng terakhir yang tinggal
1874919 ramai sudah menyedari bahawa kerja pembasmian jenayah tidak lakukan dengan sempurna dan mereka terlalu terlibat dalam pemantauan politik baik dari segi perhimpunan awam mahupun cawangan khas ini semua menyebabkan berlakunya kelemahan dan sekarang polis mahu tentera membantu mereka pula
1874920 malangnya pemerintahan kerajaan yang terlalu lama menyebabkan perkhidmatan awam keliru dan menganggap parti politik yang ada itu sebagai negara yang berhak menuntut kesetiaan kepada mereka
1874921 sebenarnya akujanji itu bertentangan dengan konsep berkecuali perkhidmatan awam yang begitu jelas di dalam peruntukan peruntukannya

1874938 now there was a rich man and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen joyously living in splendor every day
1874939 and a poor man named lazarus was laid at his gate covered with sores and longing to be fed with the
1874940 now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to abrahams
1874941 in hades he lifted up his eyes being in torment and saw abraham far away and lazarus in his bosom
1874942 and he cried out and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue for i am in agony in this flame
1874943 but abraham said child remember that during your life you received your good things and likewise lazarus bad things but now he is being comforted here and you are in agony
1874944 and he said then i beg you father that you send him to my fathers house for i have five brothers in order that he may warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment
1874945 but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
1874946 but he said no father abraham but if someone goes to them from the dead they will repent
1874947 but he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead
1874948 these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life
1874949 his winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire

1875183 the current crises requires a whole set of policy reforms and not dole outs aimed at propping up a moribund governments sagging popularity
1875184 clearly pgma set her sight on mitigating her own crisis the lack of legitimacy rather than the larger crisis that leaves the working class in dire straights
1875185 no amount of fantastic claims about her governments performance could hide the reality of the arroyo regimes glaring failure its inability to generate 1 5 million jobs a year as it promised which then led to a yawning gap in income inequality
1875186 arroyo would want us to believe that the current crisis should be blamed on everyone and everything else but itself but the truth is we are in this current rut because of governments flawed policies
1875187 that is why ousting this corrupt government would be a good start in strategically addressing our current problems
1875188 massive unemployment skyrocketing oil and food prices repressive taxation left and right demolition of informal settlers housing and the continuing trade union repression and political killings this is the real state of the working class not the delusional claims that the moribund arroyo regime would once again make during the sona

1875190 government has been consistently violating our right to development this is one of the many crimes that this government has committed
1875191 these unprecedented set of crises has paved the way for unprecedented solidarity among workers organizations
1875192 henceforth we will fight together to push this government to act on the peoples demands for jobs food housing and workers rights
1875193 we are tired of being neglected we refuse to be bought by cheap dole out programs we want a comprehensive response to poverty now
1875194 the jobless growth and low income has led to an explosion of urban poor workers
1875195 this was exacerbated by the fact that government has neglected its housing program for a very long time
1875196 to make matters worse the arroyo regime has opted to literally eradicate the housing problem by issuing executive order 708
1875197 nobody wants to be poor we remain poor because we are locked in poverty by anti poor policies and by repression and when it comes to repressing urban poor rights the arroyo regime holds the worst record next to the marcos dictatorship
1875198 kayaknya kita tidak bisa mengaku ngaku professional sebelum bisa menunjukan dirinya memang professional
1875199 at the center of this controversy really is whether jpepa will be clearly beneficial to filipinos
1875200 from the past hearings conducted by the senate on this very issue the government has totally failed to prove its case that this damned treaty is good for the country
1875201 our study shows that much of the trumpeted jpepa gains are imaginary but the losses are real in terms of job displacement and worsened poverty for rural people who will be driven away from their land and natural resources the senate cannot ignore the impacts of jpepa to the basic food producing sectors
1875202 if jpepa passes in spite of these clear threats to filipino jobs it will only worsen the jobless growth we have been experiencing under the arroyo regime
1875203 the supremacy of japanese interests in jpepa and not the interests of the filipino people has totally eroded any shred of jpepas presumed political and economic ascendancy
1875204 it jpepa will be declared unconstitutional by the supreme court that is my humble opinion as a scholar of constitutional law
1875205 can the senate remain untarnished amidst malaca ang manic push for this illegal and immoral treaty how will our senators comport themselves amidst this offensive from president arroyo the answers to these questions will be the bellweather of our senates independence their nationalism and if they are even worthy to be considered come 2010 we hope for all our sake they muster the needed courage to say no to gma and to jpepa
1875206 colby buzzell traded a dead end future for the army and ended up as a machine gunner in iraq to make sense of the absurd and frightening events surrounding him he started writing a blog about the war and how it differed from the governments official version but as his blogs popularity grew buzzell became the embedded reporter the army couldnt control despite its often hilarious efforts to do so
1875207 endlessly surprising delightfully profane an unfiltered often ferocious expression of his boots on the ground point of view of the iraq war
1875208 if in 20 years time people want to know what it was like to fight in iraq they can pick up my war and find out it tells what its like to be a grunt fighting in the sunni triangle with more power and authority than the best embedded reporter could manage it is something of a triumph for blogs over traditional media

1875512 o children of israel worship god my lord and your lord
1875513 they do blaspheme who say god is one of three in a trinity for there is no god except one god if they desist not from their word of blasphemy verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them
1875514 the jews call uzair a son of god and the christians call christ the son of god that is a saying from their mouth in this they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say gods curse be on them how they are deluded away from the truth
1875515 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his apostle nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with w illing submission and feel themselves subdued
1875516 o prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be firm against them their abode is hell an evil refuge indeed
1875517 but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them and seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1875518 o ye who believe take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other and he amongst you that turns to them for friendship is of them verily allah guideth not a people unjust
1875519 strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the jews and pagans and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say
1875520 ye are the best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right forbidding what is wrong and believing in allah if only the people of the book had faith it were best for them among them are some who have faith but most of them are perverted transgressors
1875521 allah has bestowed his gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess so as to be equal in that respect will they then deny the favours of allah
1875522 allah sets forth the parable of two men one a slave under the dominion of another he has no power of any sort and the other a man on whom we have bestowed goodly favours from ourselves and he spends thereof freely privately and publicly are the two equal by no means praise be to allah but most of them understand not
1875523 o ye who believe the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free the slave for the slave the woman for the woman surah 2 178
1875524 say to the unbelievers if now they desist from unbelief their past would be forgiven them but if they persist the punishment of those before them is already a matter of warning for them and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah altogether and everywhere but if they cease verily allah doth see all that they do
1875525 but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them an seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1875526 it is not fitting for a believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by allah and his apostle to have any option about their decision if any one disobeys allah and his apostle he is indeed on a clearly wrong path
1875527 if you want to look to a man who made allah and his messenger victorious then look to this blind man who was truly obedient to allah
1875528 he who dies from your nation and believed in allah will go to paradise
1875529 let not the believers take for friends or helpers unbelievers rather than believers if any do that in nothing will there be help from allah except by way of precaution that ye may guard yourselves from them but allah cautions you to remember himself for the final goal is to allah
1875530 it is not fitting for a believer man or woman when a matter has been decided by allah and his apostle to have any option about their decision if any one disobeys allah and his apostle he is indeed on a clearly wrong path
1875531 o prophet we have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom allah has assigned to thee and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts who migrated from makka with thee and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the prophet if the prophet wishes to wed her this only for thee and not for the believers at large we know what we have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess in order that there should be no difficulty for thee and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1875532 o prophet why holdest thou to be forbidden that which allah has made lawful to thee thou seekest to please thy consorts but allah is oft forgiving most merciful allah has already ordained for you o men the dissolution of your oaths in some cases and allah is your protector and he is full of knowledge and wisdom
1875533 if it had been thy lords will they would all have believed all who are on earth wilt thou then compel mankind against their will to believe
1875534 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his apostle nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with w illing submission and feel themselves subdued
1875535 but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them and seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity then open the way for them for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1875536 and the unbelievers plotted and planned and allah too planned and the best of planners is allah
1875537 they plotted and planned but we too planned even while they perceived it not
1875538 fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet women and sons heaped up hoards of gold and silver horses branded for blood and excellence and wealth of cattle and well tilled land
1875539 your wives are as a tilth unto you so approach your tilth when or how ye will but do some good act for your souls beforehand and fear allah and know that ye are to meet him in the hereafter and give these good tidings to those who believe
1875540 by the soul and the proportion and order given to it and its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right

1875542 sahabat alam malaysia sam is bringing four plantation affected iban communities from sarawak to kuala lumpur to speak at a series of events including a press conference on august 6 2008 to bring to public attention the encroachments of plantation development on land on which sarawak natives claim their native customary rights ncr the real extent of plantation development in sarawak is not known by the general public however malaysian authorities including the prime minister himself has been quoted to claim that our oil palm plantations will no longer involve deforestation june 24 2008 as such our press conference aims to highlight new information on the development of large oil palm and pulpwood plantations in sarawak and the following related matters poor governance and the lack of transparency in sarawak in forestry matters in particular its timber and plantation licensing process that is often alleged to be politically motivated sarawaks environmental impact assessment eia process overseen by the sarawak natural resources and environment board nreb does not possible links of plantation development to the depletion in timber resources just after 30 years of logging despite the fact that sarawak practices sustainable selective logging on a 25 year cycle can forest reserves and protected forests continue to be legally categorised as such if they have been converted into plantations

1875545 so physics is a great place to not accept the standard paradigms and to encourage children to think for themselves but you study math surely you feel confident enough in mathematics that you would be comfortable teaching your children i mean once something is proven in math it can be written in stone as an immortal truth of the universe theres no concern whatsoever about entrapping a child in a science like alchemy which is later shown to be completely wrong

1875560 puasa pada hari arafah itu dapat menghapuskan dosa selama dua tahun satu tahun yang lalu dan satu tahun yang akan datang adapun puasa asyura dapat menghapus dosa selama satu tahun yang telah berlalu hr muslim
1875561 aku memohon kepada allah untuk menghapuskan dosa yang pernah aku perbuat pada satu tahun sebelumnya hr muslim
1875562 rasulullah memerintahkan puasa pada hari asyura yaitu tanggal sepuluh dari bulan muharram
1875563 barangsiapa berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan lalu dilanjutkan dengan puasa enam hari pada bulan syawal maka nilainya seperti berpuasa sepanjang tahun
1875564 tidak ada hari dimana amal shalih di dalamnya lebih dicintai oleh allah azza wa jalla daripada hari hari ini sepuluh hari pertama pada bulan dzulhijjah para sahabat bertanya wahai rasulullah tidak juga jihad fi sabilillah beliau menjawab tidak juga jihad fi sabilillah kecuali seorang yang berangkat dengan membawa jiwa dan hartanya lalu kembali tanpa membawa sedikitpun dari keduanya
1875565 berpuasalah satu hari dan berbukalah saru hari berikutnya yang demikian itu merupakan puasa nabi dawud dan merupakan puasa yang baik kemudian aku berkata sesungguhnya aku mampu melakukan lebih dari itu maka nabi pun menjawab tidak ada yang lebih baik dari itu
1875566 rasulullah saw berpesan kepadaku tiga hal yaitu berpuasa tiga hari pada setiap bulannya mengerjakan dua rakaat shalat dhuha serta shalat witir sebelum tidur

1875573 jesus mary and joseph i place my soul in your hands
1875574 the main event of the launch of the ncb took place during the inaugural eucharist of the year of st paul on 28 june 2008 at holy name cathedral colaba mumbai which was presided over by his eminence oswald cardinal gracias of the archdiocese of mumbai the event was simultaneously repeated in several parts of the country where paulines are present
1875575 with commentary prepared by the best bible scholars in india
1875576 a gift of the pauline family to the church in india the ncb is the contextualized commentary on the sacred text made especially for india taking into account the rich cultural and religious heritage of this land
1875577 references made to indian s criptures in the commentary could perhaps make some christians uncomfortable
1875578 does not imply in any way that indian s criptural terms are parallel to biblical terms or that the parallel references are saying the same thing as the biblical text
1875579 the concept of adamah seems to be similar to that of the indian
1875580 divine human combat the fight of arjuna with god shiva
1875581 the famous gayatri mantra at daybreak facing the rising s un om bhur bhuvgajh svah may we meditate on the most excellent lustre of the sun god that he may illumine our intellect
1875582 some claim was a sexual one but the bible says nothing to support this view
1875583 composed from three separate accounts hence the repetitions and inconsistencies it is not a scientific account of what actually happened
1875584 motion pictures have used this narrative for box office effect the narrative however is not a factual historical account
1875585 mukti or moksha which is the final emancipation or liberation the highest goal of human life
1875586 the sanskrit word for the incarnation of the gods ava tara denotes the crossing of the incarnated god down into our world for the purpose of salvation
1875587 it is not correct here to speak about laws they are the charter of freedom of the children of god
1875588 the sun stood still it is a poetic way of expressing the event
1875589 causes for the fall of israel they served their filthy idols 2 kings 17 12 here the word idol does not just mean an image or representation like we have images of jesus and the saints
1875590 the israelites also adopted the foreign nations filthy and worthless cultural practices in sex greed and violence our contemporary society has its own idols and a country like india may adopt idols of a foreign culture with the false values that go with them
1875591 paul strongly advises them to separate themselves from pagans lest they be polluted in their faith and morals
1875592 will you worship baal and follow foreign gods you have not known and then you come and stand before me in this temple that bears my name and say now we are safe we can go on doing these abominable things
1875593 failed to bring about a real conversion in the lives of the people
1875594 duty to everyone particularly those living in sub human conditions fettered by social religious and economic bonds
1875595 and he rested on the seventh day and made it holy genesis 2 2 3 one may perhaps compare it to the indian samadhi which is the eighth and last stage of yoga and denotes a state of peace tranquility concentration contemplation completion accomplishment and fulfillment
1875596 breathed into his nostrils the breath of life genesis 2 7 god infused into the human body an immortal soul the principle of life prana which vivifies and pervades the human being
1875597 in their wholly undeserved death the children stand for the many innocent victims perishing all over the world through malnutrition or violence the victims of an evil system run by people like herod who blindly pursue profit and power
1875598 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them
1875599 take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground
1875600 in asking us to take off our sandals scripture is telling us that every place or manner in which god manifests himself is sacred and therefore every religion is deserving of our respect
1875601 this concept is perfectly in keeping with the mind of the church a few of the pronouncements of the second vatican council and subsequent teachings of the popes are given below to help in the
1875602 the catholic church rejects nothing what is true and holy in other religions she looks with sincere respect upon those ways of conduct and of life those rules and teachings which though differing in many particulars from what she holds and sets forth nevertheless often reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all men
1875603 ways of conduct and of life those rules and teachings
1875604 the non christian religions carry within them the echo of thousands of years of searchings for god a quest which is incomplete they are impregnated with innumerable seeds of the word and can constitute a true preparation for the gospel
1875605 led to aberrations to correct this situation all worship was centralized in the temple at jerusalem and a general cleansing of local sanctuaries was ordered the command to destroy all pagan places of worship was a means in that primitive society to preserve unity of faith and worship the significance of the plurality of religions had not yet been discovered
1875606 the religious system of these groups was also controlled by this separatist mentality
1875607 t he world scene has changed very much since then even the christian churches have come to view other religions in a new light
1875608 because first israel and then the church must be a sign of unity in the world that one people alone serve him in his only house his church
1875609 it must be noted that relativist explanations of religious pluralism which state that the christian faith is of no different value than any other belief in fact empty christianity of its defining christological heart faith alienated from our lord jesus as the only saviour is no longer christian no longer theological faith
1875610 for us believers of the new covenant who often live in a multi cultural and multi religious society it will be necessary to exercise the utmost honesty discernment and discipline
1875611 the virgin is with child in hebrew the word used is almah which simply means a young woman
1875612 ive always said we should help a hindu become a better hindu a muslim become a better muslim a catholic become a better catholic
1875613 the clear and primary mission of the church is to transmit in keeping with jesus mandate cf mt 28 18 20 gods message of hope and salvation to all of humanity
1875614 the new community bible intended for india is an effort towards the realization of the above mentioned mandate
1875615 it is the fruit of an enthusiastic project undertaken by the society of st paul
1875616 then jesus approached them and said i have been given all authority in heaven and on earth go therefore and baptise them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teach them to fulfil all that i have commanded you
1875617 whereas the original versions cost upward of rs 1000 a copy
1875618 the best bible scholars in our land a careful revision of the text too was called for in some instances
1875619 a competent team of indian bible scholars undertook the responsibility of completely re writing the commentary of each book of the bible based on sound exegesis and relevant pastoral application
1875620 harold vaz for scrutinizing the whole bible from a theological and scriptural viewpoint
1875621 bishop thomas dabre for examining the references to non christian scriptures
1875622 many references to the deep spiritual message and values found in the s criptures the same upper case s of other great indian religions
1875623 the catholic church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions
1875624 why was i in a hurry last month last year 2 years ago

1875671 the communist party was so clever because they linked nationalism to loving the party they said the party was the same as the country

1875675 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
1875676 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation

1875701 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
1875702 the draft plan states that the federal territory of kuala lumpur has only about 160 000 indians which i find strange we have some 80 000 registered voters in kuala lumpur
1875703 if one family had two children then we have to multiply 80 000 by four the figure will stand at 320 000 indians this is only an estimate based on the registered voters what about unregistered malaysian indians
1875704 obviously there are some things that should be set straight before the draft becomes a policy
1875705 we have studied the draft plan we would submit our own recommendations on the plan to city hall
1875706 the issues raised included the squatter migration to low cost flats facilities at low cost flats future and existing tamil schools and the fate of individual owned land in kuala lumpur
1875707 this plan charts the future of the city for the next 12 years if we are not given proper facts and figures then our recommendations would also be flawed
1875708 it would be better if dewan bandaraya tells us the exact figures and we work from there

1875721 im here this morning to call on the australian prime minister to stand up and condemn the ccp for interfering with ntdtvs broadcast on the eutelsat satellite ladies and gentlemen its a serious matter i thank you for your support let us work together to help the falun gong practitioners and other chinese people who have suffered tremendously under the chinese communist regimes rule
1875722 i feel it is a shame i think information should be provided to people and i dont think their way of doing this is correct
1875723 i dont think it the ccp has improved i think the beijing olympics is a political swindle it is not held for the people but for those politicians and i dont think the beijing olympics is free and open
1875724 is it really true that innocent people have bamboo sticks stuck into their fingers in china

1875726 come and see our classmates have already signed the petitions
1875727 im not surprised about the persecution as the monks were visibly suppressed too it is time that the communist regime disappears they are destroying china and its culture the monks and the falun gong practitioners do not fight back so they have become the communist partys victims yes this is so ingrained into these people
1875728 this cant go on there will be a time when the suffering will end

1875732 the real reason for the decision to suppress ntdtv exposes how eutelsat operates in china
1875733 the companys credibility is at stake and we urge its shareholders to intervene as quickly as possible so that ntdtv can resume broadcasting on this satellite if that is not done none of the tv companies that are eutelsat clients will ever be sure they could not also be arbitrarily disconnected one day because of their content
1875734 ntdtvs broadcasts irked the chinese government because thanks to this satellite they could be freely received in tens of millions of chinese homes their suspension just a few weeks ahead of the olympic games looks like a favour provided by eutelsat with the aim of obtaining new deals eutelsat tried to drop ntdtv once before in 2005 but an international campaign forced it to sign a new long term contract
1875735 it was our companys ceo in france who decided to stop ntdtvs signal
1875736 eutelsat for years has been trying to find a way to penetrate the chinese market and launch contracts are widely seen as one way to help reach that goal

1875740 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1875741 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1875742 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations

1875750 i will teach my children to think of themselves as kosovars sic but i am 43 now and i dont think it will be very easy for me to say im a kosovar im albanian
1875751 i think they will see that this is a new reality which some will embrace others will still defy it or pack their bags and leave
1875752 it wont be their country but they will have dual citizenship kosovan and serbian and this time will come much faster than some sceptics think
1875753 the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society
1875754 i want to send the message loud and clear to the supreme court of the united states and beyond make no mistake about it if anyone wants to molest children and commit sexual assaults on kids they should not do so here in louisiana here we will do everything in our power to protect our children and we will not rest until justice is won and we have fully punished those who harm them

1875772 falun gong practitioners have been it is a fact nobody can deny it then when they are subjected to the unreasonable persecution they are brave enough to resist the chinese communist regime and step forward to speak for themselves it is very precious and rare in china if only for this point i admire them
1875773 one were those with ulterior motives the others are idiots
1875774 we certainly do not want china to be in chaos but we do not want to see that chinese people are persecuted you falun gong practitioners must keep up with your efforts so china will have hope

1875807 the current and planned growth in terms of numbers and size of the supply vessel fleet has in particular been responsible for a marked increase in the number of owners and operators who have now become members we are delighted that this is the case for we have a very definite role to play helping to ensure safe operations within the expanding fleet

1875846 this is a very strange feature lying in a precise geometric fashion with six nearly equally straight sides
1875847 weve never seen anything like this on any other planet indeed saturns thick atmosphere where circularly shaped waves and convective cells dominate is perhaps the last place youd expect to see such a six sided geometric figure yet there it is
1875848 its amazing to see such striking differences on opposite ends of saturns poles
1875849 at the south pole we have what appears to be a hurricane with a giant eye and at the north pole of saturn we have this geometric feature which is completely different

1876000 according to professor snow the best way to prevent malaria is simple and doesnt cost a lot
1876001 these results suggest that combined vitamin a plus zinc supplementation reduces the risk of fever and clinical malaria episodes among children and thus may play a key role in malaria control strategies for children in africa
1876002 ddt harms human health and is not the best way to control malaria
1876003 malaria is a disease of poverty and addressing poverty is the long term solution in the short term safer and more effective approaches like bed nets rapid identification and treatment of malaria cases and local education about mosquito control are needed in africa not more ddt
1876004 now the imf and the world bank basically dont block increases in health spending if donors come forward but i dont believe they also realize the urgency and they dont speak up and say in public what they say in private in private they know that there is a silent tsunami silent holocaust underway in rural africa with mass death they know that there is not enough budgetary support to hire doctors and nurses and to keep proper provisioning of the health system jeffrey sachs
1876005 much more study and research is needed to determine with certainty what impact exposure to ddt has on humans and the environment

1876030 girlfriend she always told me as long as i was with her no clubs she didnt want me dancing with other girls which i got i would have dropped her ass pretty quick if she were out grinding on other guys but i broke up with her about two months back and still havent gotten back into the routine
1876031 two months back thats not very long howre you holding up
1876032 okay i guess i mean its been a little rough i catch myself thinking about her from time to time or ill hear a song or see a picture and it hits me in the chest and i get a little foggy behind the eyes im definitely not totally over her lets put it that way
1876033 well ill just take your current emotional state after two months as a yes do you still love her
1876034 yeah i love her probably always will doesnt change the fact that we were poison to eachother

1876037 hell maybe there is a drink that we love but were lactose intolerant and it just happens to have milk in it so despite our love for that drink it makes us sick and we cant have it thats how relationships are you may have to go through a couple before you find the one that works for you the one that completes you and compliments the person that you are you may love someone but they may be toxic to you you plus them may equal disaster so you have to end it and yeah it stings but youll move on youll survive youll be a stronger person and a better person in the long run

1876065 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1876066 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates

1876070 namun kami mendapat informasi ia mengubah rute dan kembali ke rumah di bukit segambut
1876071 kami bisa lihat sendiri betapa nyeri di punggungnya menjadi jadi kami tidak suka dia diperlakukan seperti kriminal
1876072 saya tidak marah tetapi penasaran mengapa hal ini terjadi sekarang saya baru tersentak ini semua seperti ulangan skenario lama
1876073 saya dipaksa tidur di lantai penjara tanpa alas saya tidak semestinya diperlakukan seperti itu begitu juga warga negara lain mengapa saya diperlakukan seperti penjahat besar
1876074 tentu saja saya menolak difoto siapa bisa jamin foto itu tidak segera muncul di situs youtube maksud anda saya bisa memercayai sistem
1876075 polisi bisa melakukan apa saja dengan contoh itu apalagi sudah ada orang yang menuduh anwar kami sudah tidak percaya lagi pada polisi atau kantor jaksa agung
1876076 bukan memberikan contoh dna tersebut yang menjadi masalah masalahnya apa yang terjadi setelah contoh itu diberikan karena hanya polisi malaysia yang memegangnya
1876077 berikan saja dna itu dan biarkan pakar yang membaca contoh karena dna tidak bisa berbohong mengapa anda harus cemas biarkan polisi yang menyelidiki
1876078 banyak cara untuk mendapatkan kebenaran memberikan contoh dna adalah salah satunya anda bisa hadir dengan ditemani dokter anda
1876079 oposisi berpikir kami tengah menghambat langkah mereka untuk meraih kekuasaan mereka melihat anwar sebagai seorang pemimpin masa depan yang tidak bisa berbuat salah namun yang paling mengganggu saya adalah laporan polisi telah diputarbalikkan dengan tuduhan dan politisasi apakah mereka menganggap kita harus memiliki hukum berbeda untuk orang yang berbeda lepas dari itu saya memprediksi akan ada badai politik dalam waktu dekat
1876080 anwar sedang mencoba memanfaatkan kelemahan taktis polisi dan pemerintah jika mereka memprosesnya atas tuduhan sodomi dia akan mendapat lebih banyak simpati dan dukungan dari publik jika mereka melepaskannya nama dia bakal bersih dan itu adalah kemenangan bagi oposisi

1876108 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades
1876109 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair

1876159 chinas foreign policy will have a moderate response to bushs speech because they want and need him to attend the opening ceremonies
1876160 the most they may say is something about not meddling in chinas domestic affairs

1876250 sepak bola nasional kita keok melulu begitu juga di bulu tangkis sama sekarang kondisinya sedang menurun banyak keok semua itu menunjukkan kepada kita bahwa dunia olah raga butuh regenerasi dan revitalisasi motivasi
1876251 tasikmalaya telah melahirkan susi susanti lalu taufik dari bandung sekarang indonesia menunggu lahirnya atlet baru yang bisa berprestasi di kelas dunia makanya pak menteri menegpora red sangat menyambut baik kegiatan kejuaraan ini cara ini diharapkan menjadi jembatan untuk mencari bibit baru
1876252 dunia olahraga kita sedang berada dalam kondisi siaga satu tidak usah mencari kambing hitam atas buruknya prestasi olahraga nasional sekarang ini saatnya berorientasi pada solusi harus ada perubahan pada praktik sistem olahraga nasional
1876253 sejak jatuhnya sistem pemerintahan orde baru semua komponen olahraga berjalan sendiri sendiri tidak ada pengelolaan manajemen dan koordinasi yang terpadu antarinstansi terkait dan para stakeholder
1876254 ini saatnya menpora harus mengambil inisiatif untuk melakukan reinterpretasi terhadap tugas dan tanggung jawab semua pihak yang terlibat dalam pembinan dunia olahraga nasional bagaimana pun juga dia yang sekarang menjadi koordinator bidang keolahragaan nasional yang dulu ada di tangan koni
1876255 pilah dulu tanggung jawab dan kewajibannya itu harus dilakukan agar birokrasi yang dibentuk tidak justru menjadi penghalang pembinaan terutama sejak adanya uu sistem olahraga nasional kementerian olahraga kemungkinan koi dan masih kuatnya koni
1876256 sudah saatnya kita menekankan pada pembinaan jangka panjang seperti program indonesia bangkit dan sudah bukan jamannya lagi kita hanya terfokus pada pola persiapan instan seperti pelatnas
1876257 setelah punya program jangka panjang yang terarah semua ukuran kemajuan prestasi harus mengacu pada standar kejuaraan di tingkat asia dan dunia serta olimpiade kita harus kembali ke khittah semula yaitu mempersiapkan atlet agar mampu berbicara di tingkat dunia
1876258 tapi kita juga tidak bisa melupakan pentingnya faktor dana selama dana untuk olahraga masih minim jangan pernah berharap kita bisa bicara di tingkat internasional
1876259 sebagai catatan vietnam berani menganggarkan dana 4 persen dan malaysia 5 persen dari total apbn nya untuk olahraga kita jauh dari itu
1876260 kita harus mengatur siasat kondisi keuangan negara sedang krisis sudah seharusnya kita menentukan prioritas perhatian pada cabang cabang yang berpotensi besar untuk merebut prestasi di kancah internasional
1876261 seharusnya cabang olahraga dengan medali massal seperti atletik dan renang mendapatkan prioritas pembinaan selama ini konsentrasi kita terutama pemerintah di daerah hanya terhadap sepak bola yang lebih banyak memberikan kita rasa malu di kancah internasional
1876262 kalau titik prioritas kita masih pada cabang yang digemari tapi tanpa prestasi ya seterusnya kita akan menjadi penonton menjadi penggemar tidak menjadi orang berperstasi
1876263 aku sungguh menikmati semua yang kulakukan dan itu membuatku puas

1876515 setelah pembebasanku saya tidak percaya lagi kepada orang orang bagaimana kamu dibukakan kepada kekristenan saya di yerusalem menerima suatu undangan untuk datang dan mendengar tentang kekristenan saya sangat tertarik saya mulai membaca alkitab setiap hari dan menuruskan dengan pelajaran pelajaran agama saya lakukan itu sembunyi sembunyi tentunya saya biasa bepergian ke bukit bukit ramallah ke tempat tempat seperti daerah dekat al tira dan duduk disana dengan tenang dengan pemandangan yang menakjubkan dan membaca alkitab ayat seperti telah memiliki pengaruh yang besar atasku sekarang saya melihat god elohim melalui yahshua dan dapat bercerita tentang dia berhari hari sampai habis dimana orang orang muslim tidak dapat berkata sesuatu tentang god saya menganggap islam suatu kebohongan besar menghormati muhammad lebih dari god membunuh orang orang yang tidak bersalah di dalam nama islam memukuli istri istri mereka dan tidak punya pemikiran apa god adalah saya tidak mempunyai keraguan bahwa mereka pergi ke neraka hanya ada satu jalan ke surga jalan yahshua yang telah mengorbankan dirinya sendiri di salib untuk semua kita

1876523 the full extent of the law and the facts were presented in the courtroom hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status
1876524 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1876525 this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward
1876526 unlike sen barack obama who voted against the military commissions act and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1876527 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework
1876528 its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
1876529 and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3 000 americans
1876530 the verdict i think was in in this case long before the jury went out to deliberate
1876531 that is that the military commission system at guantanamo bay is deeply flawed that mr hamdan could not and did not receive a fair trial

1876791 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1876792 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
1876793 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1876794 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1876795 you should not fear religious people in your society as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place that you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1876796 and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1876797 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders
1876798 but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

1876827 in italy france spain domestic demand is clearly weak and this is having a major impact now on german exports which was the last working engine in the system
1876828 in my view this is all consistent with a very weak middle of 2008

1876901 it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1876902 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1876903 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1876904 this is interesting work which has the potential to both reduce the risk of rejection after organ transplantation and the amount of anti rejection drugs that are required both of which will be good news for patients
1876905 as the authors say this is still early and preliminary work and further development and refinement of the process is required but this procedure does seem to have potential

1876954 ranbir and sonam are soulmates during the shoot of saawariya if bhansali pulled up sonam for bad performance for a particular shot it would be ranbir who would console her if she felt low he would comfort her and vice versa
1876955 i have no issues with ranbir and we may not be constantly in touch with each other but that doesnt mean we are not on talking terms

1877020 where then are they going to find reasons to continue this war if the tamil people are given not just the same treatment but preferential treatment wont that automatically make the ltte a redundant entity
1877021 first if what you say is true why have they been the cause of greatest suffering mush more than any sl government for tamils

1877023 they will not become redundant just because you think their reasons for existence are not there they will simply say the reasons are still there in fact real reason for their existence is their want of autocratic power
1877024 their means of existence is armed oppression and they will keep people in subjection through those means as those others mentioned have done even while saying they are doing so for those oppressed people

1877223 what is interesting about that track is here i am a 32 year old guy from canada whos singing a song that means so much to me with a 63 year old man from brazil whos singing in his own language but it means the exact same thing to both of us

1877427 not sure about the ins and outs at my favourite white racist website but i see one of the contributors marwinsing had been fired i thought they had dragged the foul mouthed knorrig off to the spca for some rabies shots at least as it all seemed too much for uhuru guru to deal with people actually debating and talking on his blog poor old guy he needed help and gave ops status to the real realist who seemed at first to be a fairly okay kind of person marwinsing who also seemed to be fairly okay and the thick as camel pee knorrig who loves to yap about things he knows nothing about it seems the uhuru guru went back to his witblitz and boerewors after taking a pounding over his homophobia and using southafricasucks blogspot com for his own personal vendetta against gays who in his book are all child molesting criminals responsible for all the crime in south africa and probably global warming too to give the old guy his due he did actually put up the postings of his detractors and as i said i think he bit off more than he could chew

1877487 our goal right from the start of the season has been to retain the british teams title and to do that our cars need to finish in first and third places on average for the remaining four rounds
1877488 if we get to a point where the title cannot be achieved then we will re assess our strategy and take a decision on whether we continue with two cars for the rest of the season
1877489 it has been rumoured in certain quarters recently that budget issues alone led us to temporarily reduce our team from two cars to one but thats simply not the case mitsubishi has been a long and proud supporter of rallying and has maintained its commitment even when other manufacturers have withdrawn their support however motorsport is a results driven industry and we are no more sheltered from that reality than anyone else

1877502 the bighand system is giving us significant commercial benefit by enabling us to communicate with our personal assistants instantly wherever we are whether drafting memos client correspondence or billing notes working on general admin or carrying out management tasks they all appear in our secretarys bighand work in progress dashboard instantly allowing them to start work straight away even before we finish passing work to secretaries via bighand finished documents can be simultaneously arriving in our inboxes we can now dedicate the extra time that we save to business development client relations or simply to maintain a healthy work life balance over the course of a year those time savings add up and naturally i would expect there is an accumulative impact on profitability
1877503 as a department head seans workload is large and varied and he can be working any time of the day or night rather than experience a major peak of work after he returns to the office his work filters through immediately regardless of where he is at any particular moment removing any time delay since the dictations arrive in regular intervals the secretaries can stay on top of workloads more easily especially as many also support other fee earners the solution enables us to better manage our time and clients are getting the most responsive service possible

1877521 the khmer rouge court does not do politics nor support or is influenced by any political party or the government
1877522 we work for the benefits of the victims and justice for humanity over the crimes of the khmer rouge
1877523 almost every cambodian talks about it because although some of them had lived abroad before the khmer rouge regime came into power on april 17 1975 they were also affected when they came back to their country they saw demolished houses and their relatives and parents in the village disappeared because the khmer rouge had killed them
1877524 ignoring the khmer rouge trials may make their parties lose some supports as it is the real history which many foreigners have acknowledged and written about this genocide
1877525 the foreign authors who write about this history could outnumber cambodian ones for the famous publications all cambodians have been affected by this issue and they are the witnesses because they dont forget it moreover they will support those who hold the trials to seek justice and reconciliation for victims and humanity as a whole
1877526 generally the opposition parties do not pay much attention to the khmer rouge trials because they think that it benefits the present ruling party cpp
1877527 however this issue has affected everyone who has gone through the khmer rouge regime it is important to include it in their political messages as the victims of the atrocities are their relatives and members of their parties at present
1877528 the khmer rouge killed everyone regardless of their political party they accused each other and planned to kill everyone if there was no urgent solution made they would have killed all however other parties may think the fall the prevention and the trials of the khmer rouge is the effort of the cpp therefore they avoided the focus on the issue by doing so they will lose supports because they cannot fulfill the request of the victims to seek justice for humanity as a whole

1877533 it is important to insist that christs death was not a sacrificial one to say that jesus dies not as a sacrifice but in order that there may be no more sacrifices is to recognize in him the word of god i wish for mercy and not sacrifices

1877571 kemarin saya ngebel langsung direktur kompetisi bli djoko driyono dan ia menyatakan persekabpas sampai saat ini sudah terdaftar sebagai peserta liga divisi utama 2008
1877572 saya tegaskan di sini secara administratif persekabpas sudah terdaftar sebagai peserta hanya persoalannya apakah dengan dana yang dialokasikan oleh pemkab melalui koni cukup nggak itu yang perlu kita sikapi bersama
1877573 saya masih optimis jika persekabpas tetap bisa tampil di divisi utama kami juga sudah merapatkan hal ini bersama pengurus lainnya
1877574 kata pak djoko kompetisi diputar 29 juli 2008 dan peserta klub diberi kesempatan untuk mendaftarkan pemainnya seminggu sebelum kompetisi diputar sampai satu bulan setelahnya
1877575 jadi kalau dihitung masa pendaftaran pemain sekitar 23 juli dan kita masih diperbolehkan menambah pemain itu pada 29 agustus atau sebulan saat kompetisi sudah berjalan
1877576 yang perlu dikhawatirkan adalah soal pendanaannya bukan kepesertaannya kalau soal ikut atau tidak kita pasti ikut tapi dana cukup atau tidak ini yang jadi persoalan

1877605 these results send a powerful message to anyone thinking of stealing or buying a stolen mobile that it will not work
1877606 by working with industry to take stolen mobiles out of action on the one hand and enacting tough legislation to give police powers to close down unscrupulous retailers who offer to unblock stolen phones on the other we are cutting the oxygen of mobile phone crime

1877611 pada hari ini telah kusenpurnakan bagi kalian agama kalian dan telah kucukupkan nikmatku kepada kalian dan telah kurhidhoi islam sebagai agama bagi kalian
1877612 tiada suatu perkara yang mendekatkan kepada surga dan menjauhkan dari neraka melainkan telah dijelaskan kepada kalian
1877613 sesungguhnya jampi jampi jimat jimat dan guna guna adalah syirik
1877614 siapa yang menggantungkan jimat maka sungguh dia telah berbuat kesyirikan
1877615 siapa yang menggantungkan jimat diantara jimat jimat jahiliah sedang ia menyangka hal tersebut bisa mendatangkan suatu mudharat atau manfaat maka sesungguhnya itu adalah perbuatan yang haram sedangkan sesuatu yang haram di dalamnya tidaklah terdapat obat
1877616 menggantungkan jimat adalah kesyirikan karena maksud orang yang menggantungkan jimat tersebut untuk menolak suatu kemudharatan bala atau meraih suatu manfaat dengannya dari dan siapakah yang lebih baik agamanya daripada orang yang ikhlas menyerahkan dirinya kepada allah sedang diapun mengerjakan kebaikan
1877617 penggantungan jimat jimat pada manusia atau selainnya berupa ayat ayat adalah haram menurut pendapat yang shahih dari dua pendapat ulama

1877621 i want as many people as possible to enjoy the two key benefits of the national identity scheme improved protection and greater convenience
1877622 allah memberitakan dalam dua ayat ini ali imran 13 14 tentang keadaan manusia kaitannya dengan masalah lebih mencintai kehidupan dunia daripada akhirat dan allah menjelaskan perbedaan yang besar antara dua negeri tersebut allah subhanahu wa taala memberitakan bahwa hal hal tersebut syahwat wanita anak anak dsb dihiaskan kepada manusia sehingga membelalakkan pandangan mereka dan menancapkannya di dalam hati hati mereka semuanya berakhir kepada segala bentuk kelezatan jiwa sebagian besar condong kepada perhiasan dunia tersebut dan menjadikannya sebagai tujuan terbesar dari cita cita cinta dan ilmu mereka padahal semua itu adalah perhiasan yang sedikit dan akan hilang dalam waktu yang sangat cepat
1877623 cinta tidak bisa didefinisikan dengan jelas bahkan bila didefinisikan tidak menghasilkan sesuatu melainkan menambah kabur dan tidak jelas berarti definisinya adalah adanya cinta itu sendiri
1877624 sebagian salaf mengatakan bahwa suatu kaum telah mengaku cinta kepada allah lalu allah menurunkan ayat ujian kepada mereka
1877625 katakanlah jika kalian cinta kepada allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mencintai kalian
1877626 firman allah niscaya allah akan mencintai kalian ini adalah isyarat tentang bukti kecintaan tersebut dan buah serta faidahnya bukti dan tanda cinta kepada allah adalah mengikuti rasulullah faidah dan buahnya adalah kecintaan allah kepada kalian shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka kecintaan allah kepada kalian tidak akan terwujud dan akan hilang
1877627 tiga hal yang barangsiapa ketiganya ada pada dirinya niscaya dia akan mendapatkan manisnya iman hendaklah allah dan rasul nya lebih ia cintai daripada selain keduanya dan hendaklah dia mencintai seseorang dan tidaklah dia mencintainya melainkan karena allah dan hendaklah dia benci untuk kembali kepada kekufuran setelah allah selamatkan dia dari kekufuran itu sebagaimana dia benci untuk dilemparkan ke dalam neraka
1877628 tetapi allah menjadikan kamu cinta kepada keimanan dan menjadikan iman itu indah dalam hatimu
1877629 maka allah akan mendatangkan suatu kaum yang allah mencintai mereka dan merekapun mencintai nya
1877630 hendaklah allah dan rasul nya lebih dia cintai daripada selain keduanya
1877631 dan di antara manusia ada yang menjadikan selain allah sebagai tandingan tandingan bagi allah mereka mencintai tandingan tandingan tersebut seperti cinta mereka kepada allah
1877632 ketika mereka saudara saudara yusuf alaihis salam berkata yusuf dan adiknya lebih dicintai oleh bapak kita daripada kita
1877633 sesungguhnya islam pertama kali muncul dalam keadaaan asing dan nanti akan kembali asing sebagaimana semula maka berbahagialah orang orang yang asing alghuroba
1877634 berbahagialah orang orang yang asing alghuroba mereka adalah orang orang shalih yang berada di tengah orang orang yang berperangai buruk dan orang yang memusuhinya lebih banyak daripada yang mengikuti mereka

1877636 addressing gender concerns will help us design our program with a better understanding of the different needs concerns roles and responsibilities of women and men while achieving brrs goal to build back better today we write the history that student will read tomorrow and i hope the story of aceh and nias continues to be one where women are leaders and decision makers of consequence
1877637 as deputies regional heads directors managers staff and advisors our job is to make sure that the work we do addresses the needs of all the population equally and that their rights are protected we are all accountable
1877638 the united nations development fund for women unifem congratulated brr on the launch of its gender policy and commended the leadership of brr for its continued commitment to gender equality and womens empowerment in aceh and nias the brr gender policy is a significant milestone for mainstreaming gender equality perspectives and womens concerns into its goal of building back better and provides the framework for advancing the womens agenda in aceh and nias unifem looks forward to continued collaboration with brr in ensuring that reconstruction programming and resources ensure de facto equality between men and women and real empowerment for women
1877639 across all sectors brrs division for women empowerment will coordinate support and supervise the implementation of the policies and strategies formulated in this paper
1877640 this is a work in progress and the most important aspect will be the formulation of an implementation framework action plan practical checklists and target indicators as a first step all brr staff will receive incentive tailored training followed by the introduction of support mechanisms to enable the implementation of prioritized sectoral strategies we hope by the end of this year we will be able to finalize the target indicators develop action plans train staff and report on pervious lessons learned and best practices in the distribution of resources among women and men across all sectors this preparation phase will lead to the implementation of this policy and strategy paper in 2007

1877643 social care services in england are gradually getting better but only for those people who manage to qualify for help
1877644 as councils face an increase in the number of older and disabled people and in the costs of care many have responded by raising the threshold people have to pass before they are entitled to a council funded service
1877645 as a result irrespective of the quality of social care services fewer people are receiving services those who do qualify for care have a high level of need
1877646 the options for people who do not meet the criteria set by their local council are limited in some cases people rely on friends and family members in others they pay for their own care some people have no option but to do without
1877647 people are choosing care that is inappropriate for their needs or will be too expensive for the local authority to fund when their own money runs out the consequences of them being forced to move to a different care home or the family feeling obliged to pay substantial top ups are now a real fear for many

1877656 in principle i think it is a good idea theres no better example of active citizenship than the army of volunteers who give freely of their time to run neighbourhood watch groups
1877657 you would need to make a distinction between those volunteers who are genuine and actively involved and give something back to their community and those watch members who simply just turn up to the occasional meeting if it helps to get more people involved in their communities then im in favour
1877658 there are many volunteers in the community who deserve some form of recognition carers for example do a fantastic job if this idea to promote citizenship does go ahead then i certainly think neighbourhood watch co ordinators and group organisers should be included too
1877659 no one goes into neighbourhood watch expecting to make any money out of it quite the reverse but it would be public recognition for the hard work that goes on to improve the safety of our local neighbourhoods
1877660 my personal opinion is that if there is going to be recognition for people who participate in good citizenship schemes then it should include neighbourhood watch
1877661 i have spoken to many children and young people from all over england who have been deeply affected by ultra sonic teenage deterrents
1877662 these devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people including babies regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving
1877663 imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender rather than to our kids the mosquito has no place in a country that values its children and seeks to instil them with dignity and respect
1877664 we tell shopkeepers to use it when they have a problem and i would be more than happy to introduce a contract which stipulates to shopkeepers how it can be used
1877665 unfortunately in many locations around the country retailers are victims of anti social gangs of youths that congregate around their premises these youths deter customers intimidate staff and can commit vandalism and violence where a retailer is faced with this problem we fully support the use of a mosquito device sparingly and as a measure of last resort
1877666 this councils top priority is the fight against anti social behaviour and crime whilst we appreciate that young people have rights we must take into consideration the rights of everyone to have a safe and peaceful existence without youth nuisance
1877667 these devices have proved useful in dispersing youths causing annoyance in many areas throughout the borough

1877671 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1877672 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1877673 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1877674 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1877675 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1877676 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1877677 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security
1877678 the british occupation of palestine took place during my collegiate years at the english college of jerusalem i was one of the first to study literature i had a deep appreciation for the english and arabic language the near east broadcasting station a branch of the bbc stationed in palestine was in need of a newscaster who spoke both languages proficiently i was immediately employed through my university upon completion of my studies that very same year at the age of sixteen my parents arranged my marriage to your grandfather when the british mandate came to an end and war broke out between the palestinians and the jews nebs relocated jedo and i to cyprus we were extremely lucky to have escaped the possibility of living in exile in our own country we enjoyed our youthful years in cyprus until my eight year contract with nebs expired we decided to move to kuwait where several of our friends and relatives had immigrated to shortly after we settled i set up an interview with the managing director of the kuwait broadcasting station i was politely turned down as it was strictly forbidden for a woman to be heard and seen on national television i was disappointed my career as a broadcaster was over as i knew it and i had to settle for an ordinary job at the ministry of foreign affairs several months later the one and only male broadcaster who presented the seven oclock news had fallen very ill kbs was in desperate need of a replacement the field of journalism and communication had not quite developed in the region and finding a stand in was almost impossible i was contacted and offered a job as the first female voice on kuwaiti television and radio good morning kuwait became an instant hit listeners from all over the middle east would call in with their praises and complaints a saudi man once called in protesting that my voice was far too sexy for the morning news in an attempt to develop the field of broadcasting i was asked to train young professionals to gain the skills and techniques that i had acquired during my years abroad a young iraqi boy who was employed by kbs as a messenger boy showed great admiration for my work he would often stand outside my office and listen through the crack of the door to the lessons i provided i secretly took him under my wing and taught him all there was to know about becoming a successful newscaster years passed us by like a breeze before we decided to retire to london england the house your grandfather bought became a home we filled our retirement years with gardening cooking travelling reading and writing one evening after dinner in a rather ritualistic manner your grandfather and i shifted into the living room and turned on the tv to watch the evening news a dr najim ansar appeared on the screen before us answering a number of questions regarding his successful career as a broadcasting professional his name seemed very familiar to me but i couldnt quite pinpoint how i knew him then it hit me like a bullet najim ansar the young iraqi messenger who used to hide behind my door the interviewer continued to bombard him with questions to what or whom can you acclaim your success without thought or delay dr ansar promptly responded to the question at hand to a lady who had faith in me i was just a messenger boy who daydreamed of celebrity fame she saw my potential and committed to educating me inspiring me to further my studies he then looked straight into the camera with beseeching eyes and said if you know of her whereabouts please inform me for i owe her the world i was thrilled to hear this but your grandfather wasnt he took a few minutes to compose himself and calmly asked that i avoid such an encounter to occur the middle eastern blood inside of him boiled with anger jealousy and defensiveness i thought back to my formative years years of success and marital bliss my husband never stood in the way of my career the way i dressed or in the upbringing of my children even at a time where a womans place was in the kitchen my husband took pride in my place at the studio he was getting old and the alzheimers was starting to develop i nodded in silent agreement respecting his wishes now that your grandfather is gone i must keep my promise i can not allow these strange men to enter my home without the presence of my husband i am an old lady who has lived a life of fame love birth and death and want nothing more of my present life than a peaceful and solitary existence

1877692 we have always enjoyed and wish to continue to enjoy excellent support from the police and our neighbourhood watch executive
1877693 their hands are tied over this and they have no option however we feel the action is short sighted and efforts should have been made to resolve the issue before giving up on it
1877694 patrols were carried out most weekends by mature members of the scheme both men and women with the aim of showing a presence and to call on the police if required
1877695 everyone was clear about what was expected of them and we were adamant that the term vigilante must not be linked to our patrols our police inspector was all for it but insisted that patrols must be carried out in high visibility clothing

1877731 saiful in this particular case has become the primary witness
1877732 if we charge a complainant it will not be possible to pursue the case this is how the legal system has worked whether you like it or not
1877733 the charge is meant to embarrass me and nothing else im not embarrassed
1877734 it is the dirty politics of a man who has lost support and very soon will lose power we will fight them hard

1877758 i had to take my lady out to dinner to get here guys
1877759 thats nothing i had to endure dinner and the opera to get out here today and the opera lasted four hours
1877760 youth is wasted on the young i didnt have to do anything to get here
1877761 it was easy when i got up this morning at 6 00am i looked my wife straight in the eye and asked
1877762 have a look at father phelan he should be punished for what he is doing
1877763 i beg your pardon but i thought you were going to punish him
1877764 what we just golfed last week is that all you ever think about
1877765 after serious consideration we have decided that yao ming will be the flag bearer
1877766 to carry the flag is one of the achievements you only dream about it was one of the great moments in my career
1877767 there is suspicion out there in the public they do not have the same confidence they once had
1877768 that means we must restore sport to its very essence of the fair play concept
1877769 in the blue riband event of athletics 100m a number of offenders have been successful there and i hope and pray we do not have another event of that nature
1877770 we have to restore faith otherwise we are morally bankrupt and saying to our kids fill yourselves up with a mouthful of pills if you want to succeed
1877771 i dont want my grandchildren to succeed in sport by taking something not natural and not healthy
1877772 jamie is a highly rated scrum half who has been on the verge of a call up to the all blacks
1877773 we are hopeful that we will shortly be able to confirm the signing of jamie nutbrown
1877774 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1877775 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1877776 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1877777 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1877778 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1877779 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1877780 initiative that all governments need to take forward to ensure that agricultural knowledge science and technology fulfils its potential to meet the development and sustainability goals of the reduction of hunger and poverty the improvement of rural livelihoods and human health and facilitating equitable socially environmentally and economically sustainable development
1877781 inflation is too high because of soaring global commodity prices
1877782 oh you are so handsome take me for a ride and i will let you do whatever you want over and over again until you are exhausted
1877783 a citizens behavior embodies and reflects on the entire nations culture
1877784 with economic reforms changes in china happened very rapidly and people didnt have time like in western countries to develop the manners that should go along with a developed economy
1877785 i think during the olympics most people will make an extra effort to be on their best behavior so that the etiquette level of citizens should reach that expected of a host city
1877786 but in the long term it is harder to change peoples behavior
1877787 the akp has never been a focal center of anti secular activities
1877788 i have no doubt in my mind that the leadership of parties will assert itself and we will take the legislative agenda forward in areas where we agree
1877789 we have serious reservations about the legitimacy of this government
1877790 even if one could expect some forward movement in policy changes for the insurance sector reforms other policy initiatives such as higher foreign investment limits have less to do with what is perceived to be economic reforms and more to do with pressures exerted by lobbies within india and abroad
1877791 the government is already under attack for the nuclear deal with the us and may not do anything that will be seen as an outcome of lobbying by pressure groups such as american insurance companies
1877792 the next general elections have to be held by april but could take place earlier
1877793 the policy priorities of the government will be focused on containing inflation and little else since it is in election mode
1877794 the government would be foolish to sell shares now and be accused by its political opponents of selling family silver at a cheap rate
1877795 this government prepares world class athletes so dont blame us for bread shortages but look instead at the incompetence of your local officials
1877796 human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
1877797 the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1877798 to get off the list the axis of evil list
1877799 a long term national sports strategy is vital for success in the olympics which india sorely lacks
1877800 in india intensive training of selected olympians begins a few months before the start of the games in this last minute scramble athletes are sent abroad and foreign coaches hired is this any way to win olympic gold
1877801 the school buildings are usually bare often dilapidated and even filthy no teaching aids are used and the child may not even have a textbook there is no craftwork or color or music physical activity is rare very few schools have any activity in the nature of organized play
1877802 and since top level positions in most associations are honorary these people are not accountable to anyone which gives them the license to go about their work in the most unprofessional way
1877803 even if you never met him you know this guy hes the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
1877804 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him obama as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that
1877805 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1877806 im sorry to say that obama was playing the race card
1877807 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip

1877809 the file mysite newpagetest aspx has not been pre compiled and cannot be requested
1877810 i have been dealing with this for the last year and it recently has gotten worse here in beijing
1877811 right now i am unable to perform my tumbling skills at the level that i need to this has an impact on my ability to contribute to the teams goals and i believe by continuing i would be putting myself at further risk there are two very capable athletes who can step in and help this team more than i can right now
1877812 after my injury with my chest i didnt know if i was able to come back in time
1877813 it is with disappointment that team gb can today confirm that frankie gavin has left the boa preparation camp in macau and will not be joining the rest of the team gb boxing squad at the beijing 2008 olympic games
1877814 it is always regrettable when an athlete who has qualified for the olympic games is unable to compete but the boas focus is now to support its remaining 312 team gb athletes who begin competing this saturday
1877815 it is the nature of our sport that we try and get our boxers to the top of their weight and it has been well documented that frankie has struggled with this over recent months
1877816 whilst the support staff down in macau and i have done everything we could regrettably it is clear that frankie will not make his weight before tomorrow mornings weigh in
1877817 frankie has been working his whole boxing career towards the olympic games and he is obviously completely devastated i would ask that his privacy is respected during this difficult period and he is given the time to come to terms with the situation
1877818 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
1877819 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
1877820 its in everyones best interest to do it quicker than later
1877821 i wont say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1877822 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants they want to play football
1877823 with no end in sight to the credit crunch and high energy costs the short to medium future looks grim
1877824 the stark reality is that in a core capital intensive industry like ours where you have a rapidly declining customer base and sales together with rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs then jobs go and companies go out of business
1877825 in the past nine months the industry has experienced a drop in business of over 30 together with an increase in production energy costs of 86 with transport costs increasing by 46
1877826 im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do
1877827 i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
1877828 the fans have got to understand that a young boy can be tempted by all this money
1877829 his father died three years ago when he was a young man and hes had to look after his mother sister and brother
1877830 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win
1877831 i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment
1877832 one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that manchester united would be fairly compensated
1877833 the figure mentioned which would be a world record would serve as some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club as least in material terms
1877834 the meeting will continue on friday in which they will discuss issues relating to promotions of brigadiers and other senior officers
1877835 yes you and i are in the trials isnt that fabulous
1877836 i should never have tried out jeremy will kill me
1877837 he barely tolerates my pilates passion as it is when i talk about pilates he gets tense threatened he knows how much it means to me so he tries to be sympathetic but you know how guys are if its not about them they dont care
1877838 tosh you are in the trials dont you know how special that is
1877839 why do you think ellen is so hot to have you be part of the pilates method allegiance she could see what youve got in the prelims
1877840 i only tried out because i thought i should now im not so sure i should do the trials

1877854 i have been testing the superbike this week so things are coming along nicely i dont think i will be stepping straight up into the senior team though because there will be far too much pressure but there are other teams we can go to
1877855 i want to learn the ropes first in another ducati team and maybe move up if things are going well there are quite a few people in front of me for the job but fingers crossed ill get somewhere
1877856 there are a couple of teams such as sterilgarda especially with xaus off to
1877857 far from being a solution to climate change agrofuels are so damaging they make petroleum look green
1877858 they threaten both to accelerate climate change and to trigger a global humanitarian disaster
1877859 our primary concern is for the safety of the people on the site and security of our terminal
1877860 in the end its always about that balance there is no cookbook or manual to say that this is the balance in the end you are always damned if you do and damned if you dont
1877861 how it interacts with or doesnt interact with local capital
1877862 separate his political role from his role as town clerk or city manager
1877863 its obvious that he is a hard working capable man possessed of a great intellect he just cant seem to get that he is not there to do the work of the anc but rather to work for the people of durban
1877864 if we get the subsidies and put the mechanisms in place and the capacity is building up we can address the housing backlog in the city within seven or eight years
1877865 i know him only as boss of the city and he doesnt appear to be people orientated he is an anti poor figure who has turned the police on us when weve tried to hold protest marches when our lawyers from the open democracy advice centre used the public access to information act to find out what the city plans for shack dwellers were we have him quoted on tape saying information is dangerous obviously for dirty poor shack dwellers
1877866 tendency to look at the challenge side of what we do not at the fact that many of the challenges are being addressed
1877867 an arrogance coupled to a low tolerance for criticism which is legendary
1877868 his style is to play the man rather than the ball he would rather attack us and go with his own theories than come in and speak to the communities and pay attention to the tests and reports we compile about the atrocities here
1877869 realised that the country was doing what hendrik verwoed said must be done
1877870 the irish catholics would give one child in their family to the church each year and it was almost like that with the rich white folks of durban giving one child to nusas the national union of south african students while the parents continued to exploit the very workers these kids were supposed to liberate
1877871 he had a kombi for transporting people his house was used for meetings and his role at a white university ensured we had resources banned books could be brought in and young activists could be sorted with bursaries
1877872 mike has always tried to overcompensate maybe because some part of him will always be that white leftie runner in the struggle
1877873 i think there is more politics in academia than people would admit so it allows you to see it and understand it a bit more because academics are quite brutal actually they will kill one another over whether a definite article should be included in a sentence let alone around the ideology

1877947 like what union leaders did to steel airline and auto industry jobs then youll love what they do to yours
1877948 with the economy sputtering businesses posting record losses and tens of thousands of american workers being laid off this is a terrible time for america to receive a shock to its economic competitiveness
1877949 but thats exactly what union leaders have in store for american workers from inflexible work rules and job assignments to uncompetitive wage demands they are trying to do to many american businesses what they already did to the steel airline and automotive industries
1877950 working americans need to recognize the realities of the modern labor movement labor leaders have alienated workers through gross mismanagement of dues and disrespect for their right to vote in secret ballot elections the precipitous decline of organized labor is a direct result of employees across the country realizing that corrupt power hungry union leaders are not looking out for anyone but themselves

1877989 the colossal misunderstanding of our time is the assumption that insight will work with people who are unmotivated to change communication does not depend on syntax or eloquence or rhetoric or articulation but on the emotional context in which the message is being heard people can only hear you when they are moving toward you and they are not likely to when your words are pursuing them even the choices words lose their power when they are used to overpower attitudes are the real figures of speech

1878048 ghostbusters will be published thats all i can say at the moment
1878049 kami sudah mengundang semua klub anggota dan kami pastikan jumat besok musbcablub sudah kita gelar
1878050 saya juga minta anggota klub persekabpas yang diundang benar benar diwakili ketua dan sekretaris atau orang orang yang punya kompetensi besar dalam memajukan persekabpas
1878051 kami juga menyesuaikan jadwal semua anggota klub dan juga bupati dan alhamdulillah kita sudah sepakati bisa menggelar hari jumat besok
1878052 untuk wacana ikut atau tidaknya persekabpas di divisi utama akan kami lemparkan pada pengurus klub tapi untuk saat ini sudah ada wacana kita sudah mendaftarkan pemain ke bli sehingga tinggal niatan pengurus klub lainnya untuk memberikan ide dan support tentang hal itu
1878053 kami harapkan pengurus klub anggota bisa memperhatikan tim yang sudah membesarkan nama kabupaten pasuruan ini tahun ini kita harus ikut kami dari pemain sudah siap soal bagaimana tata caranya kami serahkan kepada pengurus
1878054 la condurr nel deserto e l parler al suo cuore

1878056 do not build a berlin wall among the people of mindanao
1878057 we won the battle but because this is just a tro therefore our victory is just temporary
1878058 the inclusion of north cotabato in the expanded armm autonomous region of muslim mindanao is not the answer to the conflict here in fact it will only worsen the problem
1878059 this is not a fight between the muslims and the christians but we christians are just trying to defend what is right and due us we cant allow the government to ink an agreement which will later cause animosities between the muslims and the christians
1878060 we trust the philippine negotiators and the president who will not do harm to us in case we do not like the agreement we can oppose it in congress definitely we can win in the plebiscite whether we want no or yes there is therefore no reason for any worry on the moa
1878061 we all saw what happened during the all out war of president joseph estrada against the milf the milf were no match to our afp but the great damage were suffered by evacuating the poor families and large sum of public funds used by the afp which could have been utilized for schools and other much needed projects

1878063 intinya kami sudah tak sabar dengan janji janji pengurus kami ingin agar ada sikap dari pengurus klub untuk masa depan persekabpas ini sebab hal ini berhubungan dengan pembinaan pemain daerah
1878064 kami yakin dengan 52 klub anggota yang dimiliki persekabpas akan ada jalan keluar terbaik selama ini pengurus klub belum pernah diajak bicara
1878065 apalagi kalau kita tidak mengikuti kita di divisi ii lagi saya tidak bisa membayangkan berapa banyak potensi pemain kita yang tidak bisa disalurkan ke persekabpas ini menjadi sebuah kerugian besar buat pembinaan pemain daerah kita
1878066 kami hanya ingin agar ada kejelasan dari pengurus siap atau tidak mengikuti kompetisi pengurus klub juga siap membantu kok kalau kita sama sama duduk dan membicarakan masalah ini ke depan tapi orang jangan dibikin bingung seperti ini tanpa ada kegiatan apa apa
1878067 la verdad objetiva de los hechos vistos a traves de mi subjetivo cristal pero toda la verdad solo la verdad y nada mas que la verdad sin jurar sobre biblia alguna
1878068 its okie you help me i help you we help each other
1878069 apa benar mas sampai sekarang persekabpas belum ada upaya untuk ikut di divisi utama
1878070 saya hanya urun rembug saja sebisa mungkin pengurus untuk segera membicarakan hal ini dengan pihak pihak yang mempunyai keputusan saya yakin masih ada orang yang peduli dengan masa depan tim ini
1878071 saya kira masih ada waktu untuk saling membantu saya hanya menyayangkan kerja keras tim 11 yang sudah susah payah untuk menyaring pemain tapi ternyata mubadzir
1878072 mungkin insan bola lainnya juga teringat bagaimana perjuangan persekabpas susah payah naik ke divisi utama nah kalau musim ini tidak ikut dan akibatnya terjun ke divisi ii butuh berapa tahun lagi untuk mengembalikan pada posisi semula
1878073 sama sekali tidak terpikirkan keinginan itu dipakai atau tidak itu bukan soal saran ini saya lakukan sebagai orang yang mencintai tim ini
1878074 saya sendiri meski sudah ada di persema tapi tidak bisa melupakan persekabpas sangat saya sayangkan kalau tim yang membawa saya menjadi besar ini terus tenggelam ini jangan sampai terjadi
1878075 saya kira masih ada jalan untuk berbicara dan saya sangat senang sekali kalau nanti persema bisa berhadapan lagi dengan persekabpas
1878076 saya mengartikan seolah olah pengurus persekabpas tidak ada semangat lagi eman sayang kalau menengok prestasi persekabpas 2007 lalu
1878077 ngurusi bal balan iku ojo mung deleng jenango tok duduk jenang sik digoleki tapi jeneng mengurus sepak bola itu jangan hanya lihat jenang nya saja bukan jenang yang dicari tapi nama red
1878078 kami dari klub sendiri tidak pernah diajak bicara kalau semua di rembug bareng saya kira ada solusi yang pas
1878079 terkuburnya persekabpas ini saya kira karena tidak terorganisirnya pengurus padahal kalau lihat potensi pemain saya kira banyak kok pemain kita yang punya kualitas
1878080 kalau sampai tidak ikut dan akibatnya terjun ke divisi ii patut disayangkan saya kira kita ikut saja dengan menggalang potensi yang ada
1878081 kami sendiri ingin nanti ada sebuah usulan bagaimana persekabpas ke depan jangan lagi kita bicara ke belakang rapat dengan pengurus kemarin memang masih membicarakan masalah ke belakang sehingga tidak ada titik temu
1878082 saya kira mereka juga ikut andil untuk membesarkan tim ke depan
1878083 do you think that these galileans were worse sinners than all the other galileans because they suffered in this way 3 no i tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish 4 or those eighteen on whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in jerusalem 5 no i tell you but unless you repent you will all likewise perish
1878084 a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit on it and found none
1878085 no enter to sell or to take stuff in the market
1878086 salah satu pertimbangan pembagian wilayah adalah disesuaikan dengan letak geografis masing masing tim
1878087 lha kalau gu saja yang lebih dekat dengan bojonegoro masuk ke wilayah timur masa persekabpas bisa meloncat ke tengah jadi hal ini sebenarnya sudah kita usahakan maksimal
1878088 hanya karena terbagi tiga wilayah jumlah pertandingan lebih sedikit dibanding tahun lalu karena jumlah tim di beberapa wilayah juga berkurang sehingga biaya yang dikeluarkan juga bisa ditekan
1878089 la segunda conclusi n es que la creencia en certezas una premisa fundamental de la modernidad ciega y mutila la ciencia moderna esto es la ciencia cartesiana newtoniana se ha basado en la certeza de certeza la suposici n b sica es que existen leyes universales objetivas que gobiernan todos los fen menos naturales que estas leyes pueden ser descubiertas por la investigaci n cient fica y que una vez que tales leyes son conocidas podemos pronosticar perfectamente el futuro y el pasado a partir de cualquier conjunto de valores para las condiciones iniciales
1878090 la tercera conclusi n es que en los sistemas sociales humanos los m s complejos del universo por lo que resultan a n m s dif ciles de analizar la lucha por una buena sociedad es un rasgo permanente
1878091 la cuarta conclusi n que extraigo es que la incertidumbre es maravillosa y que la certeza si fuera real ser a la muerte moral

1878096 more the rough outline of a set of self referential ideals than a genuine cultural movement
1878097 simplifying to the extreme i define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives
1878098 postmodernist fiction is defined by its temporal disorder its disregard of linear narrative its mingling of fictional forms and its experiments with language
1878099 but dont the postmodernists claim only to be playing games isnt it the whole point of their philosophy that anything goes there is no absolute truth anything written has the same status as anything else no point of view is privileged given their own standards of relative truth isnt it rather unfair to take them to task for fooling around with word games and playing little jokes on readers perhaps but one is then left wondering why their writings are so stupefyingly boring shouldnt games at least be entertaining not po faced solemn and pretentious

1878211 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
1878212 it also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you

1878277 other than coop advertising does etsy plan to do its own advertising or techniques to get new buyers onto the site
1878278 does etsy plan to directly compete with ebay amazon etc for the handmade market
1878279 thanks im most interested to know your plan to protect the integrity of the site from the daily influx of resellers
1878280 do you find it diffucult to balance what the users want and the direction in which you want etsy to go in or are they usually parallel desires
1878281 do you have any specific marketing or ad campaign plans for the holiday season
1878282 what is the plan for marketing to new buyers maybe in a variety of demographics
1878283 when will etsy eliminate the need to re list for exposure the site is too big and membership too large to rely on such a limited and unfairly weighted system
1878284 if i buy items a and b i will probably want to buy item c
1878285 are there plans in the short term to help international sellers eg ability to pay etsy fees by paypal

1878288 could you all give us some pointers as to how to better promote out shops and generate more sales
1878289 i find that my demographic mid 40s would be prime candidates as etsy shoppers and yet none seem to know of it until i educate them

1878304 that i make such poor progress in my christian life why do i have so little victory over sin why do i win so few souls to christ why do i grow so slowly into the likeness of my lord and savior jesus christ
1878305 neglect of prayer you have not because you ask not
1878306 that i see so little fruit from my ministry why are there so few conversions why does my church grow so slowly why are the members of my church so little helped by my ministry and built up so little in christian knowledge and life
1878307 neglect of prayer you have not because you ask not
1878308 that the church of jesus christ is making such slow progress in the world today why does it make so little headway against sin against unbelief against error in all its forms why does it have so little victory over the world the flesh and the devil why is the average church member living on such a low plane of christian living why does the lord jesus christ get so little honor from the state of the church today
1878309 neglect of prayer you have not because you ask not
1878310 the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
1878311 many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand
1878312 and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women
1878313 and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
1878314 the lord added to the church daily that is every day such as should be saved
1878315 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in breaking of bread and in prayers

1878322 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
1878323 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
1878324 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
1878325 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
1878326 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
1878327 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
1878328 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
1878329 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
1878330 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
1878331 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
1878332 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
1878333 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
1878334 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
1878335 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
1878336 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
1878337 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1878338 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
1878339 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
1878340 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
1878341 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1878342 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
1878343 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
1878344 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
1878345 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1878346 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
1878347 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
1878348 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life

1878392 ashwin madias endorsement from the council for a livable world is just another example of how out of touch he is this group doesnt believe iran is currently an imminent threat it has lobbied for cuts to the defense budget opposes arms sales to israel and a top advisor even advocated for negotiations with the taliban after 9 11 minnesotans are looking for a candidate who will take a responsible approach to our most serious threats not someone who cozies up to far left organizations with extreme positions
1878393 candidates are required to answer rigorous questionnaires on issues and to defend their positions in interviews
1878394 council for a livable world believes that iran does not currently pose an imminent threat to the united states and is unlikely to do so for years and perhaps more than a decade
1878395 the short answer to the question is no iran is not a threat however iran is still a concern it is true they still do have the capability to enrich uranium its true they still need more transparency in their nuclear process its true they fund hamas in hezbollah its true they are not partners for peace in the arab israeli situation

1878399 the media say that the taliban wants to negotiate great what we want is to influence high level people in afghanistan to make a decision
1878400 t he pentagon has notified the congress of a proposed sale to israel of 100 guided bunker busting bombs what for israel has requested the sale of the lockheed martin corp gbu 28s worth as much as 30 million

1878802 while downloads occur on a vast scale most users are likely individuals who would not have bought the album even in the absence of file sharing

1878815 a page with high pagerank may actually pass you less if it has more links because its spread too thin
1878816 pagerank is only one of the methods google uses to determine a pages relevance or importance
1878817 google uses many factors in ranking of these the pagerank algorithm might be the best known pagerank evaluates two things how many links there are to a web page from other pages and the quality of the linking sites with pagerank five or six high quality links from websites such as www cnn com and www nytimes com would be valued much more highly than twice as many links from less reputable or established sites
1878818 pagerank has only ever been an approximation of the quality of a web page and has never had anything to do with the measuring of the topical relevance of a web page topical relevance is measured with link context and on page factors such as keyword density title tag and everything else
1878819 no one knows for sure how pagerank is currently calculated by google
1878820 thats the equation that calculates a pages pagerank in the equation t1 tn are pages linking to page a c is the number of outbound links that a page has and d is a damping factor usually set to 0 85
1878821 from this we could conclude that a link from a page with pr4 and 5 outbound links is worth more than a link from a page with pr8 and 100 outbound links the pagerank of a page that links to yours is important but the number of links on that page is also important the more links there are on a page the less pagerank value your page will receive from it
1878822 not all links weight the same when it comes to pr so an important page linking to you gives you more pr than a less important one a factor in pr propagation is the number of out links the voting page have so a pr4 page with only one out link on it might give you more weight than a pr5 page with 100 out links on it a typical example here would be the famous milliondollarhomepage this page is pr7 page with hunderds of out links therefore its weight is would contribute very little to your page pr
1878823 pagerank is logarithmic in its calculation in the same way that the earthquake richter scale is exponential in calculation so too is the mathematics behind google pagerank it takes one step to move from a pr0 to a pr1 it takes a few more steps to pr3 it takes even more steps to pr4 and many more steps again to pr5 and so one
1878824 pagerank does not rank web sites as a whole but is determined for each page individually further the pagerank of page a is recursively defined by the pageranks of those pages which link to page a
1878825 google combines pagerank with sophisticated text matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to users search google examines all aspects of the pages content and the content of the pages linking to it to determine if its a good match for users queries
1878826 google calculates pages prs once every few months pr update after a pr update is done all pages are assigned a new pr by google and you will have this pr until a new pr update is done new sites that were just launched will have a pr of 0 until an update is done by google so that they are assigned an appropriate pr
1878827 google pagerank is calculated all the time but what we see in the
1878828 its more accurate to think of it as a floating point number certainly our internal pagerank computations have many more degrees of resolution than the 0 10 values shown in the toolbar
1878829 the fact is that pagerank is based on incoming links but not just on the number of them
1878830 google tries to find pages that are both reputable and relevant if two pages appear to have roughly the same amount of information matching a given query well usually try to pick the page that more trusted websites have chosen to link to still well often elevate a page with fewer links or lower pagerank if other signals suggest that the page is more relevant for example a web page dedicated entirely to the civil war is often more useful than an article that mentions the civil war in passing even if the article is part of a reputable site such as time com
1878831 when a page votes its pagerank value to other pages its own pagerank is not reduced by the value that it is voting the page doing the voting doesnt give away its pagerank and end up with nothing it isnt a transfer of pagerank it is simply a vote according to the pages pagerank value
1878832 it often takes two full monthly updates for all of your incoming links to be discovered counted calculated and displayed as backlinks
1878833 pagerank is a form of a voting system a link to a page is a vote for that page higher pagerank pages are viewed by google as more important their votes are given more value by google much more value in some cases in general the more voting links the stronger the pagerank
1878834 the effect is that whilst the total pagerank in the site is increased one or more of the existing pages will suffer a pagerank loss due to the new page making gains up to a point the more new pages that are added the greater is the loss to the existing pages with large sites this effect is unlikely to be noticed but with smaller ones it probably would
1878835 you can lose some important links that are no longer linking to your site pr loss can also occur if some of your linking partners also experience a drop in their own pr possibly setting off a chain reaction of lower pagerank all through the immediate linking network
1878836 the more closely related the pages the higher the pagerank amount transferred
1878837 linking to high quality sites shows the search engines your site is very useful to your visitors unless your site has been around for years and is well established and trusted by google this factor will have an adverse effect on your sites overall ranking linking only to high quality content sites will give your site an edge over your competition
1878838 be extremely careful of any out going links from your site dont link to bad neighborhoods link farms banned sites etc google will penalize you for bad links so always check the pagerank of the sites youre linking to from your site
1878839 hidden text deceptive redirects cloaking automated link exchanges or anything else against
1878840 while pages with a higher pagerank do tend to rank better it is perfectly normal for a site to appear higher in the results listings even though it has a lower pagerank than competing pages google examines the context of your incoming links and only those links that relate to the specific keyword being searched on will help you achieve a higher ranking for that keyword
1878841 one way inbound links from websites with topics that are related to your websites topic will help you gain a higher page rank
1878842 search engines crawl and index webpages not websites that is why your page rank may vary from page to page within your website
1878843 content is not taken into account when pagerank is calculated content is taken into account when you actually perform a search for specific search terms
1878844 high pagerank does not guarantee a high search ranking for any particular term if it did then pr10 sites like adobe would always show up for any search you do they dont
1878845 wikipedia implemented a no follow rule indicating that outbound links should not be followed by search engine spiders
1878846 google uses open directory project dmoz org to power its directory coupling that fact with the observation that sites listed in dmoz often get decent and inexplicable pagerank boosts has lead many to conclude that google gives a special bonus to sites listed in dmoz this is simply not true the only bonus gained from being in dmoz is the same bonus a site would achieve from being linked to by any other site
1878847 google can sometimes use the meta description tag to create an abstract for your site so it may be useful to you if your home page is primarily composed of graphics however do not expect it to increase your rank
1878848 we dont really have much in the way to say
1878849 it is reasonable to assume that a page can cast only one vote for another page and that additional votes for the same page are not counted
1878850 it is reasonable to assume that a page cant vote for itself and that such links are not counted
1878851 where the links come from doesnt matter sites are not penalized because of where the links come from
1878852 dangling links are simply links that point to any page with no outgoing links they affect the model because it is not clear where their weight should be distributed and there are a large number of them because dangling links do not affect the ranking of any other page directly we simply remove them from the system until all the pageranks are calculated after all the pageranks are calculated they can be added back in without affecting things significantly
1878853 internal linking is important to your overall ranking make sure your linking structure is easy for the spiders to crawl most suggest a simple hierarchy with links no more than three clicks away from your home index page creating traffic modes or clusters of related links within a section on your site has proven very effective
1878854 google is only concerned with pages of over 100 outgoing links google considers overly linked pages to be link farms and they are penalized as such
1878855 place it in the description and meta tags place it in bold strong tags but keep your content readable and useful be aware of the text surrounding your keywords search engines will become more semantic in the coming years so context is important
1878856 the anchor text of a link is often far more important than whether its on a high pagerank page
1878857 if you really want to know what are the most important relevant pages to get links from forget pagerank think search rank search for the words youd like to rank for see what pages come up tops in google those are the most important and relevant pages you want to seek links from thats because google is explicitly telling you that on the topic you searched for these are the best
1878858 this script will send you an email whenever the pagerank of the given page changes
1878859 this little tool is not too much different then a tool that tells you your pagerank however it allows you to organize your sites with pr information in a visual network and then correspondingly connect them with arrows you can move them around like cards connect them or not and even delete them by throwing them in a trash can

1878862 unfortunately many of the insect repellents on the shelves today contain the chemical
1878863 this repellent had a strong medicine y lemongrass and peppermint scent that was certainly enough to repel me from wanting to use it again it also goes on white which requires a lot of rubbing into the skin leaving an oily film that doesnt go away until washed off
1878864 first things first this stuff has some questionable ingredients including mineral oil which is a petroleum by product as its name implies this is a bath oil and it smells like one too with an old lady perfume sort of scent to it unlike the sprays skin so soft must be applied with a cotton ball or tissue which in addition to creating extra waste is a bit of a hassle it does however leave the skin feeling soft though quite oily
1878865 new on the market this year this spray had a strong but not unpleasant citronella scent though it did linger long after the initial spray this product dries fastest of all the sprays tested leaving fingers only slightly sticky when rubbed off
1878866 this spray left me smelling like a human candy cane with its sweet pepperminty scent it goes on clear and doesnt leave an oily film
1878867 the lemony scent on this one was enough to prickle my nose hairs and make my eyes water though this dissipated somewhat within a few minutes the packaging suggests rubbing it into the skin and the result is slightly oily to the touch the convenient snap closure on the spray pump is a nice feature as opposed to the detachable plastic caps on the other bottles

1878881 get a guy who doesnt fear you because you dont want to fear a guy in a relationship and neither does he get a guy who respects you for who you are you have a lot to offer so dont think about any guy who threw it all away look for the best in a guy and only talk to those not every guy is good just like not every girl is good ignore those that you know will only bring you trouble and date those that have something going for them there are some pearls that shine bright right from the start and then there are those that need a bit of polishing before you can see them shine isnt it always better to get one that just needs a little bit of work because you can see it grow into its own those are the rare ones and those are the best

1879003 its not like you do one thing with them and thats it
1879004 they ask you what do you need to get done and they take it as a personal challenge to get that done regardless of your budget
1879005 the team will travel via mildura to murray bridge in south australia before returning along the great ocean road in victoria and finishing in batemans bay
1879006 i commend the navy and their personnel for taking part in this great charity event the navy has participated in the nsw variety bash for the past 6 years and has raised more than 250 000 to assist special needs australian children
1879007 the team has raised more than 50 000 for variety this year its another example of the navys commitment to our community and to helping sick disabled and disadvantaged aussie kids
1879008 during the 4 000km journey the navy team will also visit schools to talk about careers in the navy and the opportunities that exist

1879020 orlando is a total adrenaline junkie every time we had a day off he would say lets go bungee jumping lets drive motorbikes lets do something exciting
1879021 in response id say something along the lines of no lets go and have a nice cup of tea somewhere or lets go to the cinema
1879022 but one day orlando suggested we get boards and have a go at surfing
1879023 now surfing was something id always wanted to try so i went along loved it and caught the bug for surfing
1879024 although new zealand has some fabulous locations for surfing sometimes the water can be quite stormy so id say compared to new zealand the surfing is better in scotland as its more consistent
1879025 since ive taken up surfing in scotland a lot of my friends have taken up the sport too
1879026 that includes my hairdresser a man who used to have a full set of dreadlocks he took to surfing immediately but found that it took hours for his dreadlocks to dry he loves surfing so much hes since shaved his head
1879027 if you have never surfed before then for safetys sake dont just buy all the kit and rush out into the water yourself as surfing has a steep learning curve
1879028 if you know someone who surfs then get them to teach you
1879029 if you dont know anyone there are plenty of clubs and specialist shops where you can find out about lessons
1879030 once you have the right equipment its much easier when i was starting out someone offered me this piece of advice you float your board floats and your wetsuit floats so dont panic thats been a good bit of advice
1879031 try and get out into the sea as much as you can and aim to be in the water by eight or nine in the morning as surfing really sets you up for the day
1879032 scotland is a great place to have a holiday its where im taking my holidays this year
1879033 it all depends on my mood and what the weather is like but because nowhere is that far away its easy to pack your bags and head off
1879034 hey babe someone finally added me and i feel so fu horny do you have a webcam

1879616 however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
1879617 the ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks elevated inflation levels and risks call for higher interest rates yet this would increase the danger of a deeper extended recession best therefore to sit tight for the time being nevertheless there could well have been a three way split in the vote again
1879618 while the near term rise in inflation is unavoidable it is also temporary as weaker growth would clearly push down inflation sharply next year limiting the threat of a major recession must be the priority as soon as inflation peaks later in the year the mpc should start cutting interest rates without delay
1879619 with a difficult balancing act to achieve between keeping the inflationary threat at bay while also stimulating the economy in the midst of the current slowdown this is the right decision for now
1879620 at our quarterly meetings with the bank of england the brc and major retailers are saying weakening sales and record low consumer confidence show the downturn is deepening to avoid turning the slowdown into a slump as soon as conditions allow the banks next rate move should be down
1879621 the latest data show the slowdown in uk economic activity gathering pace and business and consumer confidence falling further however with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months the bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being
1879622 while the government talks of the need for an economic recovery plan to restart growth in the uk the bank is doing all it can to hold down consumer confidence and business investment
1879623 this is not the time to be holding rates when the prospects for the economy in 2009 look increasingly weak the bank should cut and cut fast
1879624 the mpc faced a difficult decision today in the face of rising inflationary pressures and a slowing economic outlook
1879625 holding the bank rate is better than raising rates as one mpc member suggested last month but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs
1879626 as a result of recent bank rate reductions mortgage rates are below their peak at the end of 2007 but many consumers will be looking to the mpc to respond soon to the slowing economy and reducing inflationary pressures

1879654 the yale school of art assesses the academic progress of its students carefully and followed its procedures in all respects in making its decision not to promote annabel osberg to the second year of the mfa program

1879656 how you people ever got into ivy league schools i have no idea
1879657 i know that water pong seems like a good balance between the dartmouth drinking culture and just trying to have fun however it can be just as dangerous if not more so

1879671 with this speech bush is trying to address two polar issues easing the controversy created by those who oppose his visit during the games and simultaneously maintaining americas strategy with china
1879672 remember it was not all that long ago they were in the middle of the cultural revolution with people getting put up against a wall and basically knocked off
1879673 this is really hitting the regime and their associates who have been defiling the countrys natural resources for their own benefit and leaving ordinary citizens in extreme poverty

1879683 the ones who dont may choose to go about business as usual but will have to risk dealing with a better educated and empowered consumer class that is being influenced by the most influential source out there people just like them
1879684 this isnt about immediately jumping onto twitter or any other network its about making an observation that people are craving live interactions with other people who happen to work at the companies they buy stuff from
1879685 but how can we afford to have all the people this would take
1879686 weve become so starved for authentic live human contact that when its offered up to us we are all to happy to rejoice and tell the world

1879716 het enige waar ik wel eens kwaad om kan worden bij mijzelf is wanneer ik denk te zien dat iemand b ter schijnt te weten wat ie wil en daar ook naar handelt ik voel me dan geconfronteerd met mijn eigen besluiteloosheid mijn afwachtende twijfel ik voel me op die momenten langzaam en achterop lopen dat is ergerlijk maar het zet me ook aan tot nadenken ben ik bezig met wat ik werkelijk wil en zo nee waarom niet waarom doe ik de dingen die ik doe maar ik weet niet of dat de jaloezie is waar men meestal naar refereert ik ben niet goed in jaloers worden op anderen die meer lijken te hebben dan ik op materieel vlak ik weet namelijk dat ik niet gelukkiger word dan ik nu al ben met een plasmascherm een dikke auto de perfecte spulletjes i couldnt care less de laatste paar jaar heb ik mijn bezit alleen maar zien slinken en ik ben er veel rustiger van geworden ik verlies die rust niet graag door opeens dingen aan te schaffen die ik absoluut niet nodig heb nog steeds heb ik het idee dat mijn kasten uitpuilen en dat het beter zou zijn nog meer kwijt te raken er afstand van te nemen maar waar ik wel eens kwaad om kan worden is het in your face gekwispel van sommigen die proberen te verbergen dat ze eigenlijk k helemaal niet super gelukkig zijn geworden met al die nieuwste snufjes en gadgets maar die merken dat ze wel heel gelukkig worden van het kijken naar het verschil ik heb iets wat jij niet hebt kwispel kwispel zie je ik verdenk ze ervan dat hun blijheid en tevredenheid met hun bezit nkel tot stand komt naast de afwezigheid iemand die het niet heeft ik voel me dan gebruikt misbruikt dat ze door middel van mij hun gevoel van trots willen bevestigen en versterken het bezit maakt ze niet pers gelukkiger maar het zien van het verschil met een ander die het niet heeft misselijk word ik daarvan moet ik die gevoelens van mij zien als jaloezie ik geloof het niet volgens mij raakt dat niet de kern van mijn ongenoegens
1879717 een menselijk wezen vormt een deel van het geheel dat door ons het universum wordt genoemd de mens ervaart zichzelf zijn gedachten en gevoelens als iets dat van de rest is afgescheiden dit is een soort optisch bedrog van zijn bewustzijn deze waan vormt een gevangenis voor ons het beperkt ons tot onze persoonlijke verlangens en tot affectie voor een paar mensen die ons het meest nabij zijn het is onze taak onszelf uit deze gevangenis te bevrijden door de kring van ons mededogen te vergroten en alle levende wezens en de gehele natuur in haar schoonheid te omhelzen

1879734 we believe there will remain strong demand for yield based investments
1879735 these pools can be used either to shelter income from the tax and can also be used to mitigate impacts to our unitholders beyond 2011
1879736 the government is trying to be clear that they want them trusts to convert back
1879737 if you have enough tax pools it can make sense if you stay on as a trust for a little longer

1879739 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
1879740 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
1879741 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
1879742 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
1879743 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1879744 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1879745 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
1879746 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
1879747 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
1879748 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
1879749 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1879750 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1879751 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
1879752 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
1879753 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
1879754 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1879755 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1879756 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1879757 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1879758 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1879759 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1879760 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1879761 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1879762 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1879763 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1879764 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1879765 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1879766 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1879767 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1879768 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1879769 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1879770 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
1879771 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1879772 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1879773 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1879774 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1879775 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1879776 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1879777 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1879778 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1879779 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
1879780 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
1879781 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
1879782 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
1879783 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
1879784 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1879785 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1879786 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
1879787 i always smile when i think of her smile and when i remember a funny thing she said or did but a lot of times i have a heavy heart when i think of what she went through
1879788 its okay sophie mommy and daddy are here youll be okay
1879789 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1879790 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1879791 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1879792 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

1879819 we have been so used to hard drives for so many years windows is optimized for that obviously
1879820 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4kb sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size

1879829 we must go to the moon and this is important because it gives an opportunity for indian scientists to become international players

1879835 opportunity to get better quality of credit reduce our operating cost and leverage our branch structure better
1879836 do you call mamata banerjees threat not to allow any development work to take place in the state as agitation
1879837 land acquisition has been done there in accordance with the law of the land which cant be returned
1879838 can mamata banerjee return the land to the land losers if they claim return of the said land to them
1879839 if they tatas leave singur or if they dont we state government will benefit both ways you guess what i mean and it will be felt after two years pointing to next state assembly elections

1879841 one of the most important things about the olympics is that men and women are represented equally it could just as easily be my lovely recently arrived daughter emmy or any of the kids of the guys ive played with over the years who may one day represent australia at the olympics
1879842 the thought of any of our kids playing cricket at the olympics is pretty amazing
1879843 i know my time will be well and truly past if it was to happen its probably a couple of generations of players away
1879844 the land allocated for the pilgrims needs to restored this is not a view held by hindus only but by people of all religions across the country
1879845 we stand for the fact that muslims in india love their motherland anyone who stands in our way is not a true muslim or a hindu

1879851 i am a friend of india and a supporter of us india nuclear cooperation yet i find it incomprehensible that the administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines for india with few or none of the conditions contained in the henry j hyde act
1879852 an exemption inconsistent with the us law will place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives it will also jeopardise congressional support for nuclear cooperation with india in future
1879853 all these complex issues should be examined in a serious and detailed fashion and it would be better to shelve the deal till the congress meet in january 2009
1879854 even if the india specific agreement reaches congress by september 8 it is unlikely that congress will have sufficient time to fully consider all the issues surrounding the deal the associated safeguards agreement and the nsg decision and to ascertain their impact on us and global nonproliferation standards
1879855 concerned about the potential for a significant time gap between an accelerated nsg decision and congressional action on the agreement
1879856 this would give other countries an unacceptable head start in securing commercial nuclear contracts with the indian government thus placing us firms at a competitive disadvantage
1879857 in your appearance before the foreign affairs committee on february 13 of this year you assured me that any nsg decision will have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the hyde act
1879858 as such i expect you to instruct the us representative to the nsg not to seek or support any exemption for india that does not faithfully reflect all of the hyde act conditions

1879864 this large contract with integrated well services has given boost to its new initiatives and will significantly increase its revenues from integrated services which is a high margin job
1879865 we will review the ban on futures trading later this month we would look into the crop prospects of kharif season and also the likely price trend over the next few months
1879866 lets see what happens i think that the decision is taken only for four months i do hope time will not come to extend the four months period
1879867 while there are little expectations from the indian athletes we can expect a brave show in disciplines like shooting and boxing
1879868 one has to be pragmatic and optimistic in approach as sport itself is quite uncertain
1879869 on a particular day it all counts on the performance at the given moment we do have some star performers in gagan and vijender who can assure us of an individual gold

1879875 i think im going to wait until they say so and then make that decision on that day
1879876 we want to go over and play in safety we want to make sure that were safe when were playing in any country so its not just pakistan its any country
1879877 currently zsl generates over 30 per cent of its revenues from the australian region

1879879 he was very emotional and my dad and i were crying with him when we filmed this it was like seeing the real event happen again the acting in this scene was really magnificent
1879880 while filming i just sat there with tears in my eyes fortunately when i looked around me i realised that everyone else on the sets were crying as well
1879881 it was incredibly tough in a sense it felt like i went through my own king commission at a stage
1879882 the international cricket council icc were happy for us to continue knowing that the csa endorsed it
1879883 ishant is an exceptional bowler with his height he creates a bit of bounce on these kind of wickets so that is something that india has

1879893 best buses plough to all major roads of the city making it a very convenient option and special facilities are available for the handicapped persons and senior citizens
1879894 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
1879895 i think it may take days not weeks both the impeachment and reinstatement of deposed judges will be completed within days
1879896 i had a little hiccup with the twisted ankle problem im working really hard to get fit and as i showed on court im almost fit
1879897 the last four months have been really hard for me with a couple of injuries here and there i have been trying to stay fit through all of it and my new coach tom john has done a good job i feel really strong and quite good
1879898 i have played in commonwealth and asian games in almost similar atmosphere this would get only better but im really hoping to get a match where im playing against the chinese that would be really special
1879899 they are young and its their first olympics i think handling pressure would be key and it all depends on how they respond to it they have prepared well and have some decent results to show

1879904 good quality genomic dna will be extracted and evaluated to assess the purity of red junglefowl in the wild genetic profiles could also be used for estimating genetic relation between the fowl and domestic chicken
1879905 why am i not enraged that my country has killed or hurt so many people for absolutely no noble cause in my name and with my tacit approval
1879906 but cindy it is not polite to be angry or to use such strong language in public
1879907 we somehow manage to eke out rs 1000 a month to manage our lives
1879908 we have to spend a lot on fertilizer and pesticides rates of which have increased during the past few days
1879909 whenever we have a situation like this we always hope for the best outcome and unfortunately in this situation we didnt have any survivors
1879910 i was impressed when they greeted us with folded hands in the traditional indian way but the real surprise followed when they revealed trotted out their acquired names i just could not help giggling
1879911 with everyone calling them by their new names every now and then at times you wonder if you are in india i mean this is amazing
1879912 i think they are beijing university students who learnt hindi to help us in a better way especially because language otherwise is a huge issue here it means they have made similar arrangements for all other countries and that tells you what an effort it must have been
1879913 year after year technology gets better the facilities here are the best ive ever competed in olympic wise it has the nicest dorm better that the last two olympics
1879914 we said in the referendum that we didnt want that and now hes put it in the decrees

1879918 and of course in every conversation we had pakistan came up in that conversation the generals made it pretty clear that they need more resources everyone is very very concerned about the travel areas in pakistan because a lot of the equipment and people causing this trouble come through over there its a border of about 1 500 miles so its difficult theres hundreds and hundreds of different ways to get over those mountains and thats a problem they face every day
1879919 i dedicate these songs to the cause of a better environment i will be giving a performance on august 8 along with my sister vijayalakshmi at iit madras during the concert we will have the lights mikes and all gadgets switched off for eight minutes

1879921 we should all come together for this cause and make a difference
1879922 i feel like ive gone back to the dark ages
1879923 openness and tolerance are the signs of a nations greatness and power
1879924 i was told i could come back here in november
1879925 but that petitioning was not allowed in beijing during the olympics many petitioners have been sent home already the olympics were originally going to be a good thing but the government has used it to create fear and further violate peoples human rights
1879926 i feel that theres been a change in my own personal safety i can tell from what the police told me youre an old friend of president bushs they said youre entitled to vip treatment so they deal with different people in different ways
1879927 since the protest and demonstration law was passed in 1989 theyve only approved two protests in all of china and theyve limited them to fewer than 20 people its really a joke
1879928 their aim is to display the power of the one party dictatorship
1879929 its to say a dictatorship can be prosperous and stable
1879930 chinas original aim in hosting the olympics was to break out of its isolation
1879931 china does not hope for the international community to welcome it it hopes that the international community will acknowledge it

1879936 they told me my cancer was like a galloping racehorse it was so aggressive
1879937 the difference is amazing im driving again even cycling and fishing and taking my grand kids to the park for hours
1879938 if it wasnt benefiting me then that would be my problem but it is benefiting me and ive paid my tax and national insurance all my life so why cant i have it
