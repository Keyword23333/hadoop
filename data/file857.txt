8570010 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne
8570011 much further down that track than any of the other states
8570012 weve put in place a whole series of systems which provides comparative information on performance data and so on to parents mr carpenter said
8570013 for too long i think the federal government has walked away from those schools that are doing the toughest job out there she said
8570014 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality she told abc radio
8570015 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8570016 its punitive its saying principals perform or heads will roll she said
8570017 we tried to get a good set up for the rest of the test and the race in just a couple of weeks time and i think we can be happy with how it went today
8570018 the grip levels were very low and it was quite difficult with the tyres we had and especially as i had not been in the car for some time for a real test we did make some good progress though almost 100 laps with no problems and we are not too far from the others in the times either
8570019 with the aero configuration for monza being dramatically different to any other track we visit on the calendar todays programme focussed on evaluating different set ups and wing levels specifically for the italian grand prix
8570020 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8570021 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8570022 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8570023 since we lost the final of asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka we put up a good show here and won a historic series
8570024 i am getting into a good shape now and thanks to the people who gave me support coach such as robin singh coach gary kirsten venkatesh prasad and others they gave me lots of support hopefully i will remain with the same intensity
8570025 we are happy that we could save some of the hostages but also unhappy that three of them were killed
8570026 the first to be brought out was sarita the wife of billu ram she was injured after that his four children were rescued
8570027 later billu rams brother tarsem and his wife ritu were rescued some of the hostages are still in shock
8570028 it was scary we were locked inside a room and the men said they will kill us
8570029 artillery fire and helicopter gunships engaged a militants hideout in raghan area of bajaur district at least 30 militants including important local taliban commanders and some foreign fighters were killed in the action
8570030 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8570031 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8570032 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8570033 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8570034 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8570035 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8570036 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8570037 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8570038 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8570039 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8570040 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process
8570041 very bad and the situation was becoming worse at brisbanes hospitals
8570042 la reconnaissance par moscou de lind pendance de labkhazie et de loss tie du sud cr e de nouvelles conditions sur la sc ne internationale et nam liore pas la situation actuelle
8570043 le kosovo nest pas un cas sui generis comme certains laffirment la r cente reconnaissance de deux pays le prouve
8570044 nous devons mener une politique de principe et rester fid les au droit international quoi quil advienne

8570048 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8570049 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8570050 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8570051 he could be quite a handful at times but he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comedic touch and great emotional depth said howard who plays dr frank campion
8570052 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him he said
8570053 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8570054 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8570055 in the wind the ashes fly the poison crown the charcoal ground he sang
8570056 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8570057 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8570058 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8570059 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8570060 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8570061 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8570062 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said

8570084 for the past five years alberta has enjoyed strong employment growth high levels of worker productivity and low durations of unemployment making it the best performing labour market overall
8570085 the research highlights the diverging labour markets within canada western provinces are enjoying strong labour markets while the rest of canada lags behind
8570086 the highest unemployment rates in north america are found in the atlantic provinces
8570087 despite newfoundlands burgeoning resource sector it continues to struggle with an average unemployment rate of 15 2 per cent more than three times the unemployment rate found in alberta
8570088 the split between private and public sector employment is an important aspect of labour market performance since the incentives productivity and performance of labour activity in the private sector is different from that in the public sector
8570089 lower labour productivity in the public sector is particularly problematic given that workers in the public sector tend to receive a wage premium compared to their private sector counterparts
8570090 canadian provinces should reduce public sector employment pursue more balanced and less prescriptive labour laws and avoid increasing minimum wages to improve the functioning of their labour markets
8570091 le qu bec souffre dun taux de ch mage lev dun important ch mage de longue dur e et la province affiche galement lun des plus mauvais r sultats en mati re de productivit du travail dans toute lam rique du nord
8570092 la division entre lemploi dans la fonction publique et dans le secteur priv est un aspect important de la performance du march du travail puisque les primes la productivit et la performance du travail dans le secteur priv sont diff rents de ceux de la fonction publique
8570093 la faible productivit du travail dans la fonction publique est un aspect particuli rement probl matique si lon consid re le fait que les fonctionnaires ont tendance recevoir une prime salariale par rapport leurs coll gues du secteur priv
8570094 si le qu bec veut cr er un march du travail plus dynamique il aurait tout int r t privil gier une l gislation du travail mieux quilibr e et moins rigide la province devrait galement envisager de r duire la part repr sent e par la fonction publique dans ma totale et viter daugmenter son salaire minimum

8570096 todays telecommunications market is experiencing a massive trend towards as more people and devices become connected with the increasing popularity of bandwidth intensive applications over mobile devices like laptops and smartphones wireless operators need to prepare to offer a complete personal broadband experience

8570105 quebec suffers from high unemployment rates lengthy spells of unemployment and the province has one of the worst records for worker productivity in all of north america
8570106 the split between private and public sector employment is an important aspect of labour market performance since the incentives productivity and performance of labour activity in the private sector is different from that in the public sector
8570107 lower labour productivity in the public sector is particularly problematic given that workers in the public sector tend to receive a wage premium compared to their private sector counterparts
8570108 if quebec wants to create a more vibrant and stronger labour market it needs to pursue a more balanced and less prescriptive set of labour laws the province should also consider reducing public sector employment and avoid increasing its minimum wage
8570109 im 28 ive been already on tour for 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis
8570110 i dont want to fight anybody i dont want to be facing any problems on the court i just want to enjoy

8570113 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8570114 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8570115 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that
8570116 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation
8570117 uma pista de que gosto e em que me dou bem
8570118 sei que temos boas condi es para conseguir um bom resultado em oscherleben uma pista de que gosto e em que me dou bem al m de tudo estou muito motivado um m s sem corridas deixa sempre uma enorme vontade de regressar o meu principal objectivo andar nos lugares da frente e conseguir um ritmo bom de corrida claro que para isso ser preciso que a qualifica o corra bem e j vimos que basta um d cimo a mais para se sair do meio do pelot o mas estou confiante
8570119 ter vencido duas corridas s me d ainda mais motiva o e ajuda a esquecer momentos mais complicados que j aconteceram este ano o wtcc dos campeonatos mais competitivos que pode haver e a vantagem que a seat tem conseguido fruto de muito trabalho tem sido contrariada de maneira a que os nossos advers rios n o se afastem muito s que n s n o baixamos os bra os o trabalho que toda a equipa continua a desenvolver d confian a a qualquer piloto ainda na semana passada quando estive em nogaro deu para ver como j estamos a trabalhar a m dio longo prazo
8570120 what we had all expected to happen is actually taking place
8570121 einer der gr nde f r den wechsel war ein gespr ch mit j rgen klinsmann in dem wir uns ber meine perspektiven und meinen stellenwert beim fc bayern nicht einigen konnten
8570122 jetzt stehen die chancen 50 50 oder gar sogar 60 60
8570123 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8570124 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8570125 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8570126 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8570127 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8570128 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8570129 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8570130 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8570131 now for the first time the scrolls will be a computer click away
8570132 this will ensure that the scrolls are preserved for another 2 000 years
8570133 espero completar as seis corridas que faltam e em 2009 estarei na kawasaki
8570134 o john hopkins um excelente piloto e se calhar precisa de um companheiro mais forte para se sentir motivado talvez eu pr prio precise da motiva o de trabalhar em conjunto com o meu companheiro de equipa por isso acho que vai ser uma boa experi ncia

8570136 este rali realiza se numa fase crucial da temporada e isso significa que tenho de pensar em alcan ar pontos para o campeonato de construtores mas eu sei que posso andar depressa nesta prova e por isso estou esperan ado na vit ria gosto muito dos tro os e conhe o os bem e quando isso sucede mais f cil correr riscos ali s tenho de o fazer e andar mais depressa do que noutros eventos estou ansioso por voltar a lutar com o s bastien novamente pois se esta n o ainda uma prova daquelas em que tens mesmo de vencer n o anda longe disso
8570137 to date the absence of any action from the minister is a clear sign that labor is failing to recognise and act upon significant community issues
8570138 built and natural forms which are expressions of a continuing culture
8570139 many a planner and politician can attest the dynamics of urban growth consistently overwhelm the level of effort required to preserve natural and cultural heritage
8570140 the national estate or real estate its crunch time for sydney
8570141 it isnt that we dont think historic buildings should be preserved or rivers brought back to health most of us do but we seem unable to curtail or mediate this dynamic force the result an environment that is in trouble some would say this message has lost force for want of continuous repeating but in the same breath we might observe the same fact about our heritage
8570142 in the case of the environment and tonight i mean the environment of the sydney basin the evidence is that it is in a state of extreme stress
8570143 warren there is job waiting for you as chinese governor of tibet
8570144 now warren we wouldnt want that report to possibly touch a sensitive nerve on the eve on a looming local electoral backlash rampage now would we
8570145 stunning interpretation crafted to reflect our tropical lifestyle our connection with the environment and a dynamic and festive spirit
8570146 with a new name and a new region it was imperative that we develop a new visual brand reflective of our new neighbourhood
8570147 our logo is a symbol of unity depicted by an iconic plant species growing strong and prolifically across our council region
8570148 contract awards will be based on the best overall i e best value proposals that are determined to be the most beneficial to the government with appropriate consideration given to the five evaluation factors technical management support plan performance risk price and small business participation
8570149 wir haben mit thiago neves eingkeit erzielt es sind nur noch details zu kl ren
8570150 als ich klein war war ich bayern fan aber das hat sich schnell gelegt
8570151 er ist ganz cool er kann nicht mal richtig feiern und ich bin schon besoffen
8570152 just imagine my last test appearance was in india in december sometimes it is frustrating how can a country go without a test match for eight months
8570153 the postponement of the australians tour to pakistan didnt help us at all but still we need more test matches otherwise we will not improve our position in icc rankings
8570154 there is too much stress on one day cricket these days while it is good to have international cricket and i would love to be part of it but i still want to be playing more test cricket
8570155 it has been a most frustrating injury but one of those things which one cant help i know in the past the pcb has not been very happy with the number of overs i bowled in a season for essex but this season i have been very careful with more support from other bowlers

8570162 the power of community how cuba survived to peak oil
8570163 es ist im moment nicht so dass es sich in ruhe arbeiten l sst wir m ssen jetzt schnell erfolg haben damit sich alles beruhigt
8570164 wir geben marek definitiv nicht ab er ist ein wichtiger eckpfeiler in unseren planungen
8570165 das ist bedauerlich aber robert wollte unbedingt weg er war nicht umzustimmen
8570166 ich war nicht damit einverstanden dass der schiedsrichter gegen uns einen freisto gegeben hat da habe ich ihn einfach wichser genannt ich glaube das war ziemlich dumm
8570167 the merger would lead to a high concentration on the local retail markets of four different districts
8570168 a position this strong would enable the rewe group to act independently of other competitors and consumers
8570169 rewe is obligated to sell one shop out of its portfolio in each of these problematic markets
8570170 the other local markets did not cause a concern over the hindrance of economic competition
8570171 we are very happy that the sale decision was after a thorough control expediently approved by the ohs
8570172 there are the tef nik v bridge tunnels the bunker connecting to the national technical museum near letn park the castle shelters and of course the metro atomic bunkers i think the biggest of these are at i p pavlova
8570173 our plan to not open shops at midnight to avoid discriminating against customers outside of prague proved right
8570174 most of the 500 customers from yesterday are going to receive their mobile phones today
8570175 we expect the iphone will be interesting mostly for midrange to high value customers who are used to more expensive plans and bigger monthly fees
8570176 the 2g network will work just as well we wouldnt offer the iphone if it didnt
8570177 as the only 3g network operator on the czech market we are giving our customers an exclusive opportunity to enjoy all the benefits that the iphone offers
8570178 we are striving to break the rules in this regard
8570179 everyone who wants to know which musical hits are playing on their phones can use our service
8570180 people in power have the truth but the truth is more powerful
8570181 there were the russians the tanks were coming in the opposite direction
8570182 we went through a short period of freedom so we had been writing a lot of posters i used to write a lot
8570183 i was scared but then nothing happened since that time i have been fighting for freedom
8570184 it was one attempt by a really innocent person to awaken other people from their lethargy
8570185 i never thought they would be so fast people were crying and rushing to queue in front of the bakeries
8570186 it was here this is where the main events took place
8570187 we will have to decide which game is most important and all four are important
8570188 audiences cant decide whether its a horror or a comedy and really neither can we
8570189 many of them have a gambling gene undoubtedly they are intelligent and playful but a certain degree of narcissism and extroversion is also common
8570190 ministry officials dont understand that poker in all its complexity is not gambling as much as a skill game in which good players win and bad players lose
8570191 the association is trying to exempt poker tournaments from the lottery legislation
8570192 these poker tournaments are the phenomenon of the past two years and permission is given just for tournaments in casinos
8570193 there is a considerable level of skill involved which is why you have the same players doing well at major tournaments
8570194 most of the players ive met here play simply as a way of socializing with friends or to meet new and like minded people
8570195 i feel that the benefit for czech poker institutions would come from having a better controlling body
8570196 i expect this would be organized by the state if they recognize poker as a sport
8570197 i dont believe its as easy to find poker playing venues in the czech republic as it is in sydney
8570198 i think any official recognition by a government body would definitely benefit czech poker institutions as well as increase the player base in the czech republic both of which im strongly in favor of
8570199 we prepared a varied program for b m so that he learns as much as possible of small village problems
8570200 most importantly he met with our citizens and discussed local problems i think that is the best way to learn what these people really need
8570201 mostly they concern parking zones the financing of theaters and other cultural venues or the national library blob i know there wont be enough time to deal with all of them but at least ill be able to start the debate and show the councilors what their citizens are concerned about
8570202 i will definitely speak out openly against the planned closure of the masaryk train station
8570203 we examine the financial situation of our clients carefully we do not want them to find themselves in a situation where they could not repay their debts
8570204 our mortgage portfolio is healthy thanks to our credit scoring
8570205 a growing problem is insolvency and consumer loans contribute largely to that
8570206 clients are checked less for their ability to repay the loan in comparison with other types of loans
8570207 the standard of living in both countries is rising rapidly and loans are affordable for more people
8570208 we always check a customers ability to repay their loans
8570209 if they dont understand something consumers should contact a financial consultant or lawyer they should never sign a text they dont understand
8570210 if they do they could easily become another victim of loan sharking the number of victims is rising fast
8570211 the contest should draw attention to the value of trees for the environment and make people interested in the environment they live in motivate them to care for and preserve it
8570212 the larger aim of the competition is also to encourage civic pride toward trees in the czech republic
8570213 gryc was under a lot of pressure from journalists at the time and had insufficient evidence
8570214 but they needed the information at once and advance information doesnt always ensure certainty
8570215 it is unthinkable that he could have been responsible that he would ever have done anything like that im glad that the investigation has shown that i wasnt mistaken about his personality
8570216 radek was one of those people who helped represent the czech republic very successfully
8570217 a sportsman and above all one that had a great talent someone who was determined and put forth a lot of effort in what he was doing and was predestined to become famous
8570218 he was able to give advice to others rather than being just a highly competitive person
8570219 personally i will always remember him together with his mother who never missed any competition he took part in
8570220 she was not only a great support for her son but also his friend and she always had a part in all of his accomplishments and success
8570221 we want to cut down on the bureaucracy involved in finding employment in the czech republic and enable more foreigners to work here
8570222 we want to keep absolute control over the system in case of any instability
8570223 applicants will have to be from pre approved countries and the list could change at a moments notice
8570224 there will be a list of professions available to foreign workers and only those jobs will be in the register
8570225 in the case of a crisis on the labor market such as an extreme lowering of wages due to an influx of foreign workers we could easily take affected professions off the list
8570226 already we have some 150 000 available jobs that czechs do not want to do a foreign work force will solve problems in industries requiring unskilled labor
8570227 anyone who thinks that we are super attractive for foreign workers is mistaken we are competing against countries both west and east of us well be lucky if 50 000 people come within the next five years
8570228 we are bound to see growing numbers of patients with aids and tuberculosis which will be brought by immigrants from poor countries
8570229 i am convinced that most of the people that can be seen each night on wenceslas square entered the country legally but their current activities are hardly legal at all opening the doors even more will allow more such people to enter
8570230 of course everyone will try to get the government money because its vital for the region
8570231 but its absolutely clear to us that the government is simply trying to corrupt the local authorities
8570232 on the other hand we kind of expected there would be more czech medal winners
8570233 i was completely out of shape after repeated injuries this season
8570234 although i knew i would not do too well this time i wanted to complete the race
8570235 you work hard for four years and then you get sick at the worst possible moment
8570236 the event was held aug 21 40 years after the russians invaded our country
8570237 i did not want to lose to a russian and then hear the russian anthem on this day
8570238 the audience becomes a kind of co dramatist of each evening
8570239 as our founder jaroslav stan k used to say it is difficult to talk about love to someone who is in love there are six of us and we all have to take part in the harmonics together the program planning had great importance in the times of introducing the new sound of hradi an at the beginning of pavlicas era nowadays it is more about intuition and feeling trying to get as close to the characteristic sound and expression as possible
8570240 i think the main difference between pavlica and national school composers is that none of the 19th and early 20th century composers were folk group leaders and their point of view was therefore more external
8570241 the russian military is showing off its newfound strength punishing the georgians for their sins the greatest of which is forgetting in whose backyard they live
8570242 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy
8570243 i dont have an extensive dvd collection at home i dont watch every new film that comes out i dont attend many film festivals and i dont write reviews
8570244 extends our ability to rethink the cinema creatively in the decades to come
8570245 karel apek was discussing the psychological powers of film editing in 1913 long before eisenstein was in russia while jan muka ovsk was proposing a structuralist method of film analysis in 1931
8570246 i decided to study cinema as it promised to connect several things i was interested in literature and philosophy
8570247 i started a program that comprised literature theater and film studies but soon realized that the first two disciplines were too traditional for me too heavily dependent on high culture whereas cinema allowed me to explore everyday culture apart from that film theory was an exciting field in the 90s it was a real intellectual adventure
8570248 historiography is where the most interesting research is being done internationally
8570249 instead of picking up attractive topics among fashionable film styles i decided to focus on primary research which logically means concentrating on the history of czech cinema and thats what can be done here on the highest level
8570250 he is an extremely active thorough and supportive scholar to work with
8570251 it was a tremendous pleasure to work on the anthology and i am grateful that petr chose me for this project
8570252 at the conference jaroslav told me about his old unrealized project of creating an anthology of czech film theory and avant garde manifestos from 1907 to 1938 which he had prepared at the end of the 70s but was never able to finish
8570253 if id known how much work it was going to be i might have given up at the beginning
8570254 no film scholars from abroad could imagine how advanced the ideas about cinema as an art a medium and a cultural form were during the interwar years in a small central european country
8570255 film was analyzed by poets linguists theater directors architects and musicians not as an isolated phenomenon but as a new medium that posed new challenges to their own work
8570256 when you read the piece kinema by the theater critic v clav tille from 1908 its clear that he was far ahead of even his french and german counterparts
8570257 at that time there was no permanent film production here and only several cinemas in prague and yet he was able to describe cultural historical aesthetic social and anthropological dimensions of cinema in an unbelievably complex form i think tille should really be studied along with langer and apek their work on film is unquestionably of the highest level for its time
8570258 as a body of work they are not very well known to czech scholars
8570259 some of the pieces are virtually unknown one by hackenschmied has actually been translated from english into czech while another from film critic lubom r linhart was translated from a german film journal the essays by sociologists ji kolaja and p emysl maydl were totally forgotten
8570260 my parents told me there was probably a war starting and we should buy a lot of food
8570261 my first thought was oh god the germans are here thats what we were taught in the 1950s germans not russians are occupiers
8570262 it is important that we are commemorating the 40th anniversary of the russian invasion right now because whats happening in georgia is kind of a turning point
8570263 it was just normal human behavior when you stick to your nature against being enslaved
8570264 now 40 years later history repeats itself we have the same enemy as before
8570265 now again we have a situation where most czechs dont want troops stationed on our territory but the government is inviting them anyway
8570266 the young generation doesnt know much about czech and czechoslovak history
8570267 the important aspects of our national history are disappearing once we lose this history from memory we lose our nation and in effect ourselves
8570268 it is a problem for our schools and for discussion in our families
8570269 this particular anniversary is the best possible opportunity to open minds and find a way to explain the whole situation
8570270 it seems that the situation is developing according to a proven 1990s style scenario in order to kick the 40 percent shareholder out of the business by any means
8570271 in this case we are dealing with the most experienced corporate warrior from that era in russia when odd methods were used to seize property or force shareholders out this is what the whole ingosstrakh case is about
8570272 we are ready to buy ppfis shares of ingosstrakh for a fair price
8570273 in order to determine it we offered to organize an initial public offering in collaboration with ppfi so that the free market could determine the price unfortunately ppfi doesnt agree with our proposals
8570274 russian insurance law says that foreign investors intending to buy shares in russian insurance companies have to request authorization by the regulating authority which is the federal insurance supervision service
8570275 in the case of ingosstrakh it wasnt done foreign investors need to ask before acquiring formal shareholders this deal is nontransparent and we are still in tribunal regarding its legality
8570276 basel concluded ppfi is not a long term investor ready to develop the company
8570277 to determine the price a due diligence process could be helpful
8570278 despite holding almost 40 percent of the shares we have had very limited and fragmented access to the companys books and therefore are not fully informed about the companys possible financial liabilities
8570279 ppfi is willing to purchase basels stake in ingosstrakh at a price several times higher than basel offered for the buyout of ppfi shares
8570280 on the other hand we are ready to sell our stake for a fair price
8570281 tricky one to get involved in and trust the benevolence of your partners
8570282 theres a market there but you need to navigate the tricky shoals of all the uncertainties that simply could not be abolished by putting in a series of laws after the fall of the soviet union
8570283 in the czech republic there is a big discussion right now about the lack of day care and preschools plus we are having a baby boom
8570284 plus there is no care for children under 3 years of age its a big problem for employers because moms must stay home for three years because there is no possibility of professional care
8570285 parents feel safe leaving their children since it is with their company plus there are financial advantages as the child care is financed by their place of employment
8570286 the preschools are near the company so there is no commuting plus companies have satisfied employees because they offer professional care for their employees children
8570287 its less expensive to have a company preschool than to hire and train new employees
8570288 many companies in germany are opening their own kindergartens and adapting them to the needs of their employees
8570289 there companies can write off the cost of childcare but in the czech republic the tax laws are unclear
8570290 if the company can provide space its easier as it is not difficult to find teachers and prepare the rooms
8570291 you have satisfied parents who can easily combine work and childcare and employers as a result have employees who can concentrate on their jobs and not worry about who is caring for their children
8570292 this introduces children to other languages and cultures they learn tolerance from a very young age
8570293 now we have proper teams with proper coaches now we feel like were representing our school properly and weve made friends in other schools its like were linking schools
8570294 last year we had no aim no motivation no sense of team spirit now we have lots of goals we want to be the best team in prague and to compete internationally and be the best there too
8570295 last year when we played no one really improved their skills
8570296 but mr t really pushed and put forth a lot of effort to change the pe department we really found our team spirit after he got here
8570297 i think that the improvements stem from just having more fun with physical education and from having a more varied curriculum
8570298 now i see a strong desire among our students to represent our school
8570299 team coaches have noticed the increase in students confidence as well
8570300 theyre looking more and more like a solid football team with each game
8570301 our previous athletic programs didnt have the same financial backing or investment
8570302 when the teaching staff and students can see theres an investment being made it makes the job of a physical education teacher a lot easier i think its a lot more accessible and enjoyable to students now were focused on participation more so than ability
8570303 the road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom
8570304 when the film opened even favorable reviews criticized its depictions of severed body parts and excretory functions as vulgar puerile and needlessly gross
8570305 young men have no minds souls or characters worth bothering about they care about nothing respect nothing and aspire to nothing without sports and of course war what other challenges are presented to young men being the biggest gross out on the block
8570306 i try to make a picture when i play to tell a story
8570307 if i can reach or touch just one person in the audience with my playing for me thats the most important thing
8570308 growing up in moscow i attended the tchaikovsky competition a lot
8570309 if youre a violinist its mandatory that you play that piece so it brings back a lot of childhood memories
8570310 when im going to perform a piece i spend time with it and see what affect it has on me then i try to pass that along
8570311 its a beautiful city im looking forward to performing there
8570312 rachmaninov is not only my favorite pianist he is also the best pianist
8570313 still i dont try to use what i hear in his recordings in my own playing
8570314 where the concerto for all its familiarity sounded as fresh and emotionally stimulating as could be
8570315 i wanted to be able to have undergraduate and graduate students participating and nyu prague director ji pehe is extremely willing
8570316 ive been here seven times since 1990 ive seen immense changes how cultural tourism has evolved the country coming out of communism its a wonderful place for a case study
8570317 in kutn hora we met with a man from the citys planning council who showed us parts of the city normal tourists wouldnt get to see
8570318 we also had a guest lecturer from the countrys monument program who talked about the unesco and world heritage site criteria the politics of listing a site the sites that are listed in the czech republic and challenges for tourism
8570319 the czech national art scene seems to be more for the locals while there are the concerts in the churchs targeted only at tourists
8570320 but most companies who run the church concerts wont talk to me i did tour the national theater though
8570321 is it viable to do in the czech republic taking into consideration the attitudes of the czech people their recent history and whether its worth preserving
8570322 you can compare it to berlin where the countrys socialist past is very apparent
8570323 in the times ive been here since 1990 regarding tourism people were trying to figure out how it was going to happen
8570324 for students i tell them the city has been at this for about 10 years identifying and protecting monuments the castles chateaux and villages i cant imagine any other country that has this kind of an opportunities to introduce new things
8570325 theres an endless list of possibilities tours of wineries breweries architecture jewish sites you can get out of the city and into the rural areas if the rural areas want the tourism
8570326 within this program we want to create the methodology of internships for student
8570327 social work has been taught at mongolian universities for 10 years or so but still represents something very new and unusual and it is missing its identity and own literature
8570328 the dormitories are in horrifying shape with rooms that must have only six square meters and there are four to five people living there sharing one table
8570329 we currently have 30 students with internships and we are hoping to extend this number
8570330 the amount should cover the wage cost of an employee who is guiding our student
8570331 we are trying to create a background for literature related to social work written by local experts in mongolian because so far they just have to use foreign literature
8570332 but this is a completely different culture and mentality and you just cant take some methods from the czech republic or somewhere else and apply them here it just doesnt work like that
8570333 mongolians are a very proud nation they are aware of problems and they try hard to improve the current state of things
8570334 the people there like czechs and for us it is a great opportunity to show the world what czechs are capable of that we really can help people in need
8570335 that which you learn while young youll find readily when you are old
8570336 the three hour lessons are done in an integrated manner
8570337 the children do the same things that they would normally do during a preschool morning but they are surrounded by english when they do it that is exercises washing hands eating a snack playing in the garden etc
8570338 if the children start with english at an early age they are much more advanced than those who start at 10
8570339 we considered akcent to be the best when it came to childrens education
8570340 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8570341 in light of the trying times that the airline sector is currently experiencing as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel costs we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year
8570342 ik vind dat het rijk het allemaal veel te lang heeft laten duren en dat de procedure nodeloos ingewikkeld is gemaakt
8570343 ik vind dat we onze bijdrage 1 4 miljoen euro al hebben geleverd

8570345 transport over de weg is veel milieuvriendelijker geworden het scoort op vervuiling meestal beter dan kustvaart
8570346 waardoor het beter scoort dan wegverkeer voor co2 emissies en dus een belangrijke bijdrage levert aan de kyoto doelstellingen
8570347 we zijn aan een inhaalbeweging bezig die vijf jaar geleden is gestart
8570348 in het verleden werd mondriaan wel beschouwd als de koele mathematicus die systematisch te werk ging nu weten we dat hij weliswaar zeer nauwkeurig was maar toch best experimenteel werkte
8570349 maar ook met het blote oog was al veel waarneembaar victory boogie woogie werd gemeten doorgelicht en geobserveerd zonder het aan te raken
8570350 we tonen morgen op het symposium voor mondriaankenners een versie van het schilderij zonder tape en m t tape we hebben het schilderij digitaal kunnen ontdoen van de dikke plakken tape zo is er een interessante kale reconstructie ontstaan die opmerkelijk ander is de victory boogie woogie die we nu kennen is duidelijk dynamischer door zijn extra vakjes zit er meer ritme en tempo in
8570351 it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society
8570352 when blood cholesterol was measured at both six weeks and twelve weeks both groups showed either no change or a reduction particularly in their ldl bad cholesterol levels despite the egg group increasing their dietary cholesterol intake to around four times that of the control
8570353 there is no convincing evidence to link an increased intake of dietary cholesterol or eggs with coronary heart disease through raised blood cholesterol indeed eggs make a nutritional contribution to a healthy calorie restricted diet we have shown that when two eggs a day are eaten by people who are actively losing weight on a calorie restricted diet blood cholesterol can still be reduced
8570354 it is well known that there are substantial differences between individuals in how their sleep is structured and when they perform best if they are awake these grants will allow us to characterise these differences in much greater detail and to relate them to genetic differences and molecular markers eventually we hope that these findings will make it possible to develop new treatments for disorders of sleep and wakefulness
8570355 we believe that the international reputation of our sleep researchers and the use of such an integrated multi disciplinary approach are the reasons why these research proposals were so attractive to the funding agencies this illustrates the importance of supporting interdisciplinary and translational research teams in modern bioscience research
8570356 i think we finally found the balance that makes it work for us i dont think we could do another album there is a certain kind of electricity that you want in a band the reason we broke up was because we didnt have that anymore
8570357 i think were all pretty happy creatively with what were doing these days
8570358 the years have gone by dean has started doing compositions and voice acting todd is producing and recording bands in his studio and randy has been playing with a number of people so everybody has really moved on
8570359 it was a pretty quick thing i had planned to do an ep usually 4 6 songs with my friend john askew and i thought id have a whole bunch of songs ready and when he showed up i had nothing and we decided lets do a concept album and i said what are you reading about and he said privatized space travel and we had both just read the same article about robert bigelow and the x prize
8570360 we had five days to complete the project and i think the first day was a complete waste because we didnt know what we were doing and then we started three of the songs
8570361 three of the songs were done with john and three were done by myself and i kind of finished it up and mixed it by myself it was a really fun project in general i like to make records quickly
8570362 i think there was a period for me mentally when i was always comparing it toad the wet sprocket with my solo career
8570363 i finally realized im not in a rock band anymore
8570364 but its great to get to go back and play these songs we wrote and visit it the past but know i dont have to live there and it doesnt have anything to do with what im doing now
8570365 you either do something about it or you stick your head in the sand
8570366 to be honest with the people im going to work for
8570367 some research that didnt require sophisticated computer technology and the like took place immediately
8570368 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression

8570376 moving from one indian company to another was in no way a sign that there was a level of desperation by mtn weve always said this is an economies of scale business and that we must attain critical mass and continue to grow it
8570377 pushing us to do a deal urgently there are a number of opportunities and we continue to pursue these
8570378 we have not looked at south america as an area thats not to say we would not rule it out but africa the middle east and futher east is most the logical expansion area for us

8570380 i woke up in a hotel i didnt know what to do i turned the tv on and wrote a letter to you

8570384 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
8570385 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
8570386 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
8570387 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

8570403 todays tools are able to manage various types of content and put specific types of content onto specific devices
8570404 what is truly needed however and what we expect to see emerge over the next few years are tools that unlock the value of content in the digital age by formatting and managing content for device independence when content becomes reusable across multiple delivery channels its value increases enormously which will foster investment in developing the next generation of content management tools

8570412 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8570413 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to maintenance costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated

8570422 i just hope and pray that there is an informal ceasefire
8570423 there is always that possibility and when something like that happens surely the other side perhaps muslim civilians could be arming themselves too to defend themselves cause both sides are innocent victims muslim civilians on one hand and christian civilians on the other hand
8570424 if civilians are arming themselves on both sides this problem can become a war of civilians which is even more serious authorities on both sides milf the military and the government should take a second look at the situation so that it does not escalate into a war of civilians

8570445 hippocrate disait d j que pour tudier la m decine il fallait tudier le climat le changement climatique aura des effets directs et indirects sur la sant des gens directs avec des d sastres des inondations des s cheresses mais aussi indirects avec les maladies
8570446 entre le milieu des ann es 1970 et les ann es 2000 le changement climatique a t responsable denviron 150 000 morts suppl mentaires par an il touche de mani re crasante les populations les plus pauvres selon nos estimations les chiffres devraient cro tre et encore nous ne prenons en compte quune partie des causes de morts dus au changement climatique ce nest que la partie immerg e de liceberg
8570447 nous avons d j un gros probl me de paludisme et le changement climatique va le rendre encore plus difficile la temp rature influe sur la survie des moustiques et sur les parasites qui transmettent le paludisme lint rieur des moustiques en gros plus il fait chaud et plus le taux dinfection est haut
8570448 dans de nombreux cas la bact rie qui infecte leau ou la nourriture survit mieux une temp rature plus lev e mais laugmentation du nombre dinondations et surtout de s cheresses va contaminer les sources deau par exemple en p riode de s cheresse les gens stockent de leau pendant plus longtemps ou se lavent moins les mains
8570449 un de nos plus gros soucis est la sous nutrition cest le principal facteur de mauvaise sant et elle tue 3 5 million de personnes par an avec le changement climatique la production alimentaire devrait augmenter l g rement dans les pays riches mais devrait baisser autour de lequateur ceux qui en ont le plus besoin en auront moins
8570450 on est daccord sur le constat mais il y a un d fi comment se d velopper et moins polluer cest difficile
8570451 les pays africains sont ceux qui ont le moins contribu au changement climatique et ce sont eux qui en souffrent le plus
8570452 nous ne voulons en aucun cas compromettre la lutte contre la pauvret dans les pays les plus pauvres les pays riches qui ont contribu la plus grande partie du probl me doivent faire le premier pas

8570474 mrs bells tragic death was wholly preventable had the care home shown due regard for health and safety it would not have been possible for her to have got on to the window ledge from where she then fell
8570475 unfortunately similar accidents have occurred elsewhere in the uk and residents climbing out of windows is a hazard that is clearly referred to in health and safety executive guidance for the care sector
8570476 this case is a lesson to all care homes about the importance of securing their windows so that nothing like this can happen again

8570478 all businesses must consider the dangers of falls from height and the risks associated with persons including members of the public such as the elderly and children using their premises and put in place adequate control measures
8570479 the survey underlined that people have strong opinions on green issues and theres good evidence of green behaviour in the uk the danger is that we overestimate how good the state of the uks own environment is and become complacent in our efforts to become greener messages about some basic but effective actions for example recycling have been understood and we are willing to accommodate these in our lifestyles but with our negative view of the environment globally we should recognise our responsibility to do whatever we can and be open to a wider range of green behaviours in order to reduce our impact on the environment as much as possible

8570487 its harder to hide the truth in a video than it is in words

8570528 were delighted that cardiff council is working with sustrans on this innovative neighbourhood improvement project we fully support this initiative which encourages the residents of somerset street to improve their physical environment and promotes a greater sense of community
8570529 the residents have voted on various street layouts and this is their first chance to see if it will work and how it will look
8570530 we want to get all the residents involved in this scheme and saturdays event is also a chance for neighbours to get to know each other better and celebrate their new street im sure there will be a good buzz
8570531 sadly the lawsuit came with a high cost to us personally and interpersonally

8570535 when you see things like this its no wonder the people voted no to the lisbon treaty this will be the end of the traditional baking competition at local shows across the country therefore impacting on local revenue its just ridiculous
8570536 honestly when i saw this first i thought it was something to do with april fools day i just couldnt imagine someone sitting down and coming up with this rule
8570537 it is a real deterrent to those entering shows if you thought your prize produce was going to be destroyed immediately after a tiny taste was taken from it then you would not want to enter a competition
8570538 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8570539 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8570540 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8570541 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8570542 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8570543 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8570544 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8570549 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
8570550 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
8570551 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
8570552 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
8570553 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused

8570563 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted it will be a really big bonus for us
8570564 if gareth is here this time next week i will be relieved
8570565 i would have said only a few weeks ago that i was resigned to the fact gareth would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in pre season and when he didnt come with us to malaga because i assumed everything would be done that week
8570566 but as for the future now lets go one step at a time that is what i would be looking at
8570567 i wouldnt want to be rushing anyone into making decisions or asking anyone to do something that no one is really comfortable with

8570569 the club is looking to make its mark in a wider area

8570572 they wont get anywhere near my team if they are not capable of helping it

8570574 the taxi drivers who would be transporting for johannesburg and pretoria are not doing so

8570577 they will sit down and resolve this thing they must meet halfway
8570578 that is an employer employee relationship we are not party to that
8570579 there was a decision that was handed down that we need to give united routes this was in error because the routes belong to civic centre taxi association
8570580 we as government cannot be seen to be fuelling violence
8570581 we cannot have united coming in to invade we are in close contact with the police and they will monitor the routes we have been told there are some incidents of violence taking place we leave that to law enforcement

8570668 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8570684 when patients have large dressings to treat ulcers or pressure sores it is very important that they stay in place
8570685 the dressings are there to heal the wound and for nasty open wounds such as diabetic leg ulcers this is quite a job to maintain the correct healing atmosphere and environment the dressing must not be moved
8570686 when such serious wounds are exposed there is a significantly increased risk of infection in addition when the dressings come off there can be damage to the often already compromised periphery of the wound further inhibiting the healing process

8570702 in the bible a man dedicated to g d the nazarite after taking a special vow abstained from intoxicating beverages never cut his hair and avoided corpses an inadvertent breach of these rules called for purificatory rites his vow was for a fixed term though it could also be for life at the end of which he was released samuel the prophet and samson were nazarites the name is also spelled nazirite

8570708 ill deal with it when its time to get surgery
8570709 its not a decision i would make health would and we are waiting to hear from the experts in the ministry who are looking at what the next steps might be if needed we are prepared to make it happen as effectively as possible
8570710 parents need to be aware of the circumstances and be listening for information
8570711 a strategy is being put together and we will be ready at the school level to respond my goal at the moment is to be sure of accommodating any request or expectation
8570712 at this stage we wont be providing immunization clinics but through the provincial health officer we will be monitoring any potential cases that we see in schools and providing those immunization opportunities should the need arise
8570713 i believe that parents always want what is best for their kids though they make different decisions around immunizations
8570714 if theres an outbreak and your kids not immunized keep them home dont just continue to spread the virus around ideally this should be a quarantine issue
8570715 they do it for hepatitis and the boosters you know polio and whatnot they do it at school so why not mumps
8570716 the district was very good and active a few months ago about immunization so i was happy about that
8570717 i havent had any concerns addressed to me for chilliwack its been in the paper for quite a few months
8570718 that being the case we would be offering clinics on a routine basis but i think what well be doing particularly in vancouver is looking for cases and if we start to see cases well start taking more proactive measures
8570719 if password exists but is not encrypted it gets encrypted
8570720 we clarified through legislation when schools can be charged but there seems to be confusion with boards of education from time to time about what they can charge fees for
8570721 anything that helps a child stick with the main curriculum from kindergarten to grade 12 must be free
8570722 the reason we felt comfortable with the fee system still in place was that boards were required to ensure that any child that couldnt pay would be supported by the school district
8570723 the announcements havent affected us the way they affected other school districts because we havent charged fees for many years
8570724 and we have a rider on everything in the district that if there is a child who cant afford to go to an academy then we will pay for it they dont have to prove that their parents have lost a job or anything like that weve had these policies in place for so many years that it is just the way we do business
8570725 for working in walnut when we are handing out pine theyd have to pay the difference
8570726 our district is in full compliance of the law in spirit and letter it wasnt difficult but there was a cost that being said however most of what we had offered before is still available to students
8570727 we see the slowdown in the u s market as a fundamental change

8570730 2008 continues to be a challenging year for the real estate industry worldwide
8570731 our strategy over the past few years of reducing our dependence on transactional income by growing our consultancy property management and fund management businesses has served us well in these unsettled markets
8570732 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8570733 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8570734 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8570735 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of
8570736 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8570737 the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8570738 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8570739 statuephilia will bring together a group of modern sculptors all of whom have prowled through the corridors and display cabinets of the british museum in their formative years looking at sculpture and feeling its unmatched international potency
8570740 the british museum helped to make these artists what they are now they are seeking to return the favour
8570741 the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8570742 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8570743 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8570744 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8570745 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8570746 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8570747 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8570748 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8570749 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8570750 and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8570751 finally it is also worth bearing in mind that a lot of these shareholdings in these companies are actually owned by the pension funds and insurance companies
8570752 so this rather primitive 19th century view of capitalism that some people still have that these companies are somehow still owned by a few very rich individuals is just not true

8570759 the issue is whether that consultation process was reasonable and whether any resulting accommodation was adequate
8570760 the crowns obligation to reasonably consult is not fulfilled simply by providing a process within which to exchange and discuss information
8570761 nevertheless there is no question that substantial logging and road building have occurred on those lands and that these activities have had a significant impact on the sustainability of timber resources and on other aspects of gitanyow tradition and culture

8570768 het was natuurlijk beter geweest als het besluit afgelopen voorjaar al was genomen bij de navo ministersvergadering in roemeni toen onthield een aantal van de landen die ons steunen zich van stemming maar nu is er geen twijfel meer dat georgi navo lid zal worden er zijn bij het conflict teveel mensen omgekomen om te zeggen dat dat een voordeel is maar het heeft het proces wel versneld
8570769 as media practitioners we should also play our role to instil spirit of patriotism and love for the country in the society besides to disseminate information

8570771 i was touched and vindicated coming back to parliament after 10 years after all that i had gone through in that time now it feels good to be back it is my right
8570772 doesnt yang berhormat agree with me that the one with no credibility is the corruption ridden government this is the government which tabled a bill last monday giving no opportunity to mps including those of friends from the other side to study it and presented it with malicious intention this is a bill opposed by both the bar council and non governmental groups the opposition would support any bill that would benefit the people but we are against the method employed by the government to push this bill through without taking heed of the publics voice
8570773 a person should always view himself as being half meritorious and half guilty of sins similarly one should view the entire world half meritorious and half guilty if he does one mitzvah he has the potential to favorably tip the scales of himself and the entire world and he brings for himself and all the world salvation and deliverance

8570826 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals

8570859 the split between private and public sector employment is an important aspect of labour market performance since the incentives productivity and performance of labour activity in the private sector is different from that in the public sector
8570860 lower labour productivity in the public sector is particularly problematic given that workers in the public sector tend to receive a wage premium compared to their private sector counterparts
8570861 if quebec wants to create a more vibrant and stronger labour market it needs to pursue a more balanced and less prescriptive set of labour laws the province should also consider reducing public sector employment and avoid increasing its minimum wage

8570991 people expected a riot and were stunned that it turned out to be not only something positive but something that went to the core of our patriotic values
8570992 so whats easy to forget is just how much the things we take for granted have changed
8570993 then it was assumed that black people couldnt gather in large numbers anywhere near politics without upheaval now youve got a black person contending for the highest office in the country its a pretty big change

8571003 to see all those black people together was something new it was an uplifting experience
8571004 it was the first time id been in a group like that we were accepted like everybody else and we felt part of the whole group
8571005 the crowd was vocally divided and i could overhear their criticisms
8571006 with king being so young and inexperienced they felt that america was not ready for change
8571007 king was the first black man who was able to rally a large number of people together just like obama is

8571058 die arzneimitteltherapie spielt f r die verl ngerung der mittleren lebenserwartung eine wichtige rolle sie ist verbunden mit einem gewinn von ca drei wochen pro jahr
8571059 trotz erh hter kosten f r medikamente mit einem signifikanten konomischen gewinn verbunden da nicht medikament se ma nahmen reduziert wurden
8571060 seit anfang des 20 jahrhunderts ist die durchschnittliche lebenserwartung um mehr als 30 jahre angestiegen und das nicht zuletzt dank innovativer arzneimittel so ist die anzahl der todesf lle bei krankheiten die in deutschland die meisten opfer fordern wie krebs herzinfarkte und schlaganf lle aufgrund moderner medikamente stark zur ckgegangen auch bei anderen erkrankungen auf die besonders ltere menschen schauen wie etwa rheuma haben wir den patienten leidensdruck genommen lebensqualit t zur ckgegeben lebensjahre geschenkt auf all das sind wir als branche stolz doch hat die innovationsfeindliche kostend mpfungspolitik der bundesregierung mit ihren zum teil widerspr chlichen berregulierungen viel zu oft verhindert dass moderne medikamente noch h ufiger eingesetzt werden hier muss ein umdenken zum wohle der betroffenen einsetzen
8571061 die pharmazeutische industrie arbeitet mit hochdruck an der bek mpfung gerade der weit verbreiteten krankheiten unser ideal muss die m glichst vollst ndige heilung bleiben aber angesichts der besonderen bed rfnisse alter menschen d rfen kriterien wie verbesserte handhabung bessere kombinierbarkeit und bessere vertr glichkeit von medikamenten nicht gering gesch tzt werden

8571063 wir waren eine stunde im schwimmbad am nachmittag haben wird trainiert abends wurde der grill angeworfen und anschlie end die sauna aufgesucht
8571064 wir hatten uns schon vorgestellt dass es besser l uft aber die belgier waren k rperlich schon weiter als wir zudem haben die belgier im gegensatz zu uns sehr gut gespielt wir sind jetzt k rperlich deutlich besser in schuss und haben zuletzt ein trainingsspiel gegen erstligist bad d rrenberg gewonnen
8571065 der athletische aufbau der teams die sich schon im januar qualifiziert haben ist gezielter gewesen da wir noch die zweite qualifikationsrunde spielen mussten die wir locker geschafft haben fehlen uns auch ein wenig spiele gegen top teams
8571066 ich glaube das spielt keine gro e rolle zuvor hatten wir gegen die belgier nie verloren ein nachteil ist es auf jeden fall nicht aber es w re auch ganz nett gewesen wenn wir ein spiel gewonnen h tten
8571067 eigentlich steht die formation leider ist jonas umlauft im spiel gegen bad d rrenberg umgeknickt wir nehmen ihn aber mit f r ihn hat marvin prolingheuer gespielt und hat seine sache gut gemacht im mittelblock haben wir in der vorbereitung viel gewechselt das werden wir auch im turnierverlauf tun auch je nach gegner aufstellen
8571068 das passiert einfach mal wenn man in einem viertelfinale mal einen nicht so guten tag erwischt bisher war es noch nicht so dass alle spieler an so einem entscheidenden tag topfit waren es gab immer einen oder zwei akteure die nicht ihre top leistung abrufen konnten oder verletzt waren das ist mit jonas leider wieder der fall aber ich bin guter dinge
8571069 das ziel ist eine medaille auch wenn man in dieser gruppe dritter oder vierter werden kann ich rechne mit einer sehr ausgeglichenen geschichte am ende k nnten auch die s tze bzw ballpunkte den ausschlag geben wir haben bereits alle geschlagen gegen russland belgien und polen aber auch schon verloren

8571097 india is an open economy and there is substantial potential for growth bolstered by foreign exchange inflows
8571098 however the economy is not dependent on foreign money as it is underpinned by domestic institutional money such as domestic life insurance companies which are amongst the biggest investors at present
8571099 the development of a world class infrastructure is central to indias emergence as a global economic powerhouse
8571100 this is despite the fact that uncertain global markets are undergoing a correction and the indian markets are likely to be range bound in the near term
8571101 ich glaube an miro klose doch ich erwarte von ihm eine leistungssteigerung er muss jetzt mal explodieren auch miro wird an seinen leistungen gemessen aber wenn er fit ist hat er eine unglaubliche ausgeglichenheit
8571102 so fr h m chte ich mich nicht festlegen das h ngt schon davon ab in welcher form er anreist und wie er trainiert
8571103 das macht man eigentlich nur bei spielern die k rperlich richtig angeschlagen sind aber miro ist ja k rperlich belastbar
8571104 das mag sein aber er hat gesagt dass er k rperlich wieder auf ein hohes niveau muss dann wird er mit sicherheit wieder der alte klose
8571105 wenn er wieder die weiten wege gehen kann wird er treffen und als vorbereiter gl nzen das muss er bald schaffen und nicht erst in weiter ferne
8571106 wir alle glauben an ihn wir sch tzen unseren spieler miro wei dass er sich auf uns verlassen kann
8571107 dass miro nat rlich besser spielen muss da sind wir uns alle einig

8571113 analysts can now utilize rcis templates within meridium providing a comprehensive knowledge base that can be leveraged to accelerate analysis activities as rca teams progress through their analyses related to a particular failure they can now review additional possibilities made available with the proact logic tree knowledge management templates these templates provide the analyst with greater visibility into something their team could have missed and can also incorporate previous findings into the current analysis to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are identified
8571114 when conducting rcas one of the greatest benefits any company can achieve is to optimize the learning from past experiences to avoid future consequences the new proact templates provide a jump start to this process by allowing past experience to be easily accessed and utilized within new analyses by publishing proact analyses and using templates within meridium we are providing a growing rca knowledge base that will make future rcas more accurate comprehensive efficient and effective

8571135 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8571136 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon

8571150 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8571151 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8571152 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8571153 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8571154 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8571155 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8571156 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8571157 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8571158 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations

8571173 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8571174 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8571175 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8571176 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks

8571180 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anti cancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8571181 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8571182 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about 10 times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8571183 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumour inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add

8571197 i just want to have a nice match win or lose and whatever happens to go home i dont want to face the foot faults and all these things so i dont have to put myself together lets try to calm down lets play some tennis
8571198 it took six years for india to understand the sensitivities of asean and for the asean to understand the sensitivities of india
8571199 this will lead to greater integration between asean and its dialogue partner

8571214 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8571215 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8571216 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8571217 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8571218 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8571219 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth

8571232 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8571233 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8571234 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8571235 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8571236 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8571237 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8571238 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8571239 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8571254 cuando detienes el di logo interno todo se hace posible y los proyectos m s disparatados se hacen alcanzables
8571255 luego de un largo per odo de tests y ex menes para intentar explicar esta par lisis en sus patas traseras llegamos a la conclusi n de que no pod amos hacer nada y que la nica forma de ayudarle en su movilidad era adosarle rueditas as que todos los d as durante algunas horas se le ponen estas ruedas y puede moverse de manera casi normal
8571256 creo que es algo muy bueno e inteligente que puedan hacer esto y ayudar as a los animales

8571260 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8571261 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8571262 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8571263 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8571264 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8571265 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8571266 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8571267 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8571268 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8571269 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8571270 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8571271 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8571272 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8571273 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8571274 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8571275 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8571276 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8571277 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8571278 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8571279 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8571280 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8571281 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8571282 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8571283 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8571284 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8571285 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8571286 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8571287 i wish i had know this before we had three
8571288 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8571289 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8571290 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8571291 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8571292 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8571293 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8571294 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8571295 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8571296 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8571297 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8571298 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8571299 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8571300 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8571301 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8571302 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8571303 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8571304 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8571305 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8571306 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8571307 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8571308 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8571309 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8571310 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8571311 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8571312 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8571313 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8571314 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8571315 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8571316 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8571317 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8571318 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8571319 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8571320 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8571321 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8571322 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8571323 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8571324 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8571325 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8571326 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8571327 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8571328 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8571329 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8571330 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8571331 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8571332 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8571333 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8571334 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8571335 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8571336 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8571337 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8571338 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8571339 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8571340 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8571341 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8571342 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8571343 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8571344 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8571345 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8571346 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8571347 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8571348 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8571349 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8571350 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8571351 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8571352 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8571353 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8571354 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8571355 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8571356 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8571357 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8571358 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8571359 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8571360 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8571361 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8571362 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8571363 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8571364 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8571365 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8571366 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8571367 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8571368 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8571369 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8571370 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8571371 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8571372 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8571373 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8571374 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8571375 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8571376 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8571377 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8571378 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8571379 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8571380 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8571381 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8571382 they were planning to join al qaeda members in saudi arabia to carry out joint attacks
8571383 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8571384 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8571385 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8571386 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8571387 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8571388 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8571389 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8571390 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8571391 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8571392 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8571393 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8571394 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8571395 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8571396 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8571397 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8571398 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8571399 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8571400 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8571401 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8571402 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8571403 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8571404 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8571405 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8571406 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8571407 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8571408 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8571409 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8571410 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8571411 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8571412 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8571413 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8571414 you can take it that he enke will again be the no 1 in vaduz and helsinki
8571415 our aid diplomacy is aimed at gaining more influence in the ior and coupled with our look east policy it is expected to help india gain in the region
8571416 we are helping african countries and countries like mauritius in capacity building and capability enhancing we would like to play a benevolent role in this area
8571417 the fact that india could deploy its navy within 24 hours of the tsunami created ripples in the world including in washington
8571418 post tsunami we have learnt more lessons in relief operations each of our ships carries one logistic brick a pre packed container of emergency supplies which is sufficient to cater to 200 people for 30 days the brick includes a community kitchen and packaged food to provide immediate relief and succour
8571419 traditionally aid is a potent tool of diplomacy with a number of natural disasters hitting the indian ocean region the indian navy has acquired a great edge
8571420 moreover engaging in capacity building and capability enhancing is the direct way of enhancing influence
8571421 indias move should be seen in the light of chinas interest in the region and the aid it has been showering on the nations to avoid a choking of its energy supplies
8571422 aid diplomacy as a tool furthered indias foreign policy objectives after tsunami
8571423 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply sceptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8571424 we can still continue with the government we are aware of the mandate given to us and we will work hard to deliver
8571425 i dont think abdullah is a match for anwar he is going to raise all kinds of issues and questions and will demand and pressure the prime minister for answers it is going to be a tough time for barisan
8571426 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8571427 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8571428 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8571429 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8571430 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8571431 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8571432 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8571433 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8571434 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8571435 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8571436 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8571437 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8571438 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8571439 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8571440 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8571441 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8571442 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8571443 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8571444 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8571445 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8571446 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8571447 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8571448 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8571449 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8571450 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8571451 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8571452 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8571453 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8571454 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8571455 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8571456 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8571457 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8571458 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8571459 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8571460 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8571461 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8571462 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8571463 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8571464 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8571465 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8571466 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8571467 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought
8571468 indira gandhi in april 1980 offered the aasu under the leadership of mahanta to accept jan 1 1967 as the cut off date for identification of illegal migrants but mahanta rejected the same and later went on to accept march 25 1971 as the base year while signing the assam accord in 1985
8571469 why did mahanta and the aasu reject 1967 as the cut off year and later agreed to 1971 it is for the people of assam to analyse and see who is more interested in freeing the state of all foreigners or checking infiltration is it mahanta aasu or the congress
8571470 when we asked indira gandhi as then aasu leaders she denied any such proposal
8571471 it is true that jan 1 1967 was offered to the aasu as the cut off date but then at that point in time we as aasu leaders were fighting for 1951 as the base year and so rejected the offer
8571472 i was asked by then assam governor l p singh and then union home minister giani zail singh to convince the aasu leadership to accept jan 1 1967 as the cut off date i talked to the aasu leaders for five hours but they rejected the offer mahanta was present at that meeting
8571473 facts are facts and mahanta cannot change or deny now
8571474 after this controversy questions are asked if mahanta actually betrayed the interest of assam by accepting 1971 instead of 1967 as the base year for identification of foreigners
8571475 it would be a problem now to take back mahanta and his party with the new controversy of mahanta rejecting 1967 as the base year people are very sensitive to the issue
8571476 we see the slowdown in the u s market as a fundamental change
8571477 since the first cases of hiv surfaced in the late 1970s and early 80s there has been no cure for the hiv pandemic
8571478 it tells us that our efforts must go on further and further
8571479 an enhanced and effective response to hiv in asia and the pacific which ensures equal access to services for all persons regardless of their age sexual orientation or gender
8571480 countries must clearly identify their priorities and effectively allocate their resources if they expect to maintain a financially sustainable response to the hiv epidemics in the region
8571481 if it does not happen we will declare self rule nov 2 the name of andhra pradesh on all signboards and on all vehicle registration plates in the region will be changed to telangana
8571482 it is my moral duty to unite all pro telangana forces we will not allow telangana votes to divide on account of multiple parties

8571487 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8571488 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8571489 crafting a platform that marries john mccain to the republican base on environmental policy is a little like filing a lawsuit against yourself in which you only get to write one brief
8571490 hillarys speech last night at the democratic convention wasnt the only event of the day to inspire a little nostalgia for the clinton administration a few hours earlier the census bureau released its 2007 poverty and income report a snapshot of the nations economic well being the easy takeaway message might have been this we never had it so good as we did in bill clintons second term when unemployment was low poverty was low and the rising tide was lifting all boats the census data for 2007 confirm that all future economic progress will be measured by whether the country can get back to the prosperity of 1999 right now the bush administration cant even get the economy back to where it was during the 2001 recession
8571491 oil markets are waiting for gustav and waiting to go on holiday
8571492 by recognizing the two provinces the argument goes moscow completely antagonized the georgians irritated the west and undermined its own principled foreign policy of insisting on international law specifically when it comes to the illegal secession of kosovo of course given that georgia was already a 100 client state of washington and that no matter what russia did or did not do it would still be demonized in the west those two points hardly seem relevant what about the principle of sovereignty then this is the truly puzzling part by claiming that ossetia and abkhazia simply followed the kosovo precedent russia effectively abandoned the moral high ground from which it criticized natos aggression in the balkans and admitted that the world order is now based on the pernicious doctrine of might makes right and whatever we can get away with washington and brussels have operated from those premises for years but their results have been less than stellar
8571493 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8571542 the valencia circuit has been the victim of modern f1 car design therefore had the circuit appeared in the sixties there can be little doubt that it would have produced some classic races a touch of rain or a safety car period might also have worked wonders so we should not despair and classify the track as yet another barcelona or hungaroring i am sure that it has the potential to produce wonderful races in the future should the new regulations due to take effect in 2009 have the desired effect it is very likely that valencia will become one of the much anticipated highlights of the year
8571543 ever since nelson piquet showed good pace to score second place in germany after a period behind the safety car the team have believed that a slow few laps when tyres first run has improved their consistency over longer distances
8571544 the formula one round on the streets of valencias harbour could be renamed the mediterranean grand prix from next season
8571545 the change is set to be made because the race at the nurburgring needs a different name due to the a disagreement over the german grand prix title that the countrys motorsport authority the adac does not want to pay for
8571546 theres not even any negotiations in that sense first i still have to understand who has the best options for me to follow then we can start negotiating but at the moment were still seeking those best options

8571560 the british army should not expect a civic reception at the expense of the rate payers of limavady their government misled their own people and the united nations to engineer an oil grab the consequence of this is that the stability of the region has been undermined for generations to come

8571565 firstly let me wish the two fire fighters who were injured a speedy recovery from myself and the local community
8571566 i was speaking to local people at the scene last night and to local community representatives and members of the fire service
8571567 it is very clear that a number of people set out to deliberately set fire to this caravan and put peoples lives at risk in doing so
8571568 they then went on to attack the fire service who were going to attend the fire
8571569 i would ask those who were responsible for both attacks to reflect very seriously on the consequences of their actions
8571570 these are serious attacks and couldve resulted in death or very serious injury for a number of people
8571571 elderly people living in this particular area are under constant attack by a number of individuals who seem to think its acceptable behaviour to attack and harass those who are most vunerable in society
8571572 i think the wall is an accident waiting to happen young children walk past it every day on the way to school and it looks as if it could topple over at any time
8571573 there is a huge crack right through the middle of it and kate needs to do something about it
8571574 the wall was inspected by our building control team and there is a problem
8571575 we have written to the owner to tell them they need to deal with the problem
8571576 ashlee broke down in tears at a doctors appointment in early august when she found out shes gained more weight than is considered in the healthy range
8571577 she went straight to the planet blue shop in los angeles and bought six pairs of size zero jeans she cant wear them now but she hopes it will give her the incentive to watch what she eats
8571578 were getting the nursery ready i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun
8571579 ive kind of been texting matt back and forth and hes doing great and his wife luciana is doing great
8571580 i wanted to do something physical so there was drowning more drowning being set on fire struck by lightning and then drowning again we certainly got physical it was pretty full on
8571581 i think you should do different things for videos i feel ive got a good legacy for them
8571582 i love acting and would love to do more projects but i think it confused people a bit its tougher for people to cross over here than it is in america
8571583 it was the first time wed ever been on top of the pops and oasis were also on and we were a bit nervous of liam because hed been saying stuff about us
8571584 but wed been presenting on popworld where id dressed up as liam gallagher and done an impression
8571585 and as he was saying this he was dunking his biscuit in his tea and it was then he started swearing but he left it in too long and it ruined the biscuit so it was my fault and i ruined his biscuit then he started being horrible about our band
8571586 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8571587 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go i made sure he was naked when they took him because i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8571588 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone to all the media in the world
8571589 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again and wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8571590 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8571591 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8571592 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio and i cry and im just like everybody else you know i have all the same feelings that everyone else has
8571593 i really get a kick out of spoof movies for me its a chance to show people that i have a sense of humor and dont take myself too seriously
8571594 i couldnt do what brad and angie are doing i wouldnt have the patience or dedication you need to take care of a family i admire those qualities in other people but its not for me
8571595 im doing exactly what i want to do i hang out with the same friends i spend time in italy and then i go back to work i try not to worry about anything else
8571596 i love my gray hair and the fact my face has more character than it did in my 20s
8571597 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8571598 public safety is the key element of our management protocols
8571599 a basic premise of our approach is that individuals or their cases are not discussed in public
8571600 a decision on whether to make a public disclosure is made on a case by case basis and is reached after full consideration of all the circumstances by the partner agencies
8571601 the management of registered sex offenders is a sensitive and complex area of work which involves the police and a range of other agencies
8571602 this is undertaken under the auspices of the mappa process multi agency public protection arrangements and within the national accommodation strategy for sex offenders

8571607 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8571608 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8571609 we are extremely pleased that such a global player has chosen to extend its agreement with uefa and the uefa champions league
8571610 the uefa champions league continues to be a very valuable platform for our sponsor partners and we are sure it will provide sony with excellent opportunities to connect with the fans and further strengthen their brand identity
8571611 we are excited to be able to announce our continued sponsorship
8571612 as we see the uefa champions league as the ideal platform on which to be able to demonstrate the full capabilities of our hd products
8571613 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8571614 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8571615 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8571616 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8571617 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8571618 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8571619 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8571620 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8571621 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8571622 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8571623 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8571624 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8571625 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8571626 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8571627 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8571628 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8571629 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8571630 for me personally it was very important to win here in croatia
8571631 this is my homeland people know me here they respect me dinamo are a serious club so i was prepared for this clash and the team played well
8571632 of course i am glad i managed to score in such an important match
8571633 the final scores in donetsk and zagreb reflected what we saw on the pitch
8571634 i want to congratulate my players who looked good from a tactical point of view and id also like to wish dinamo luck in the uefa cup
8571635 after a win like this i think we will catch up with the ukrainian league leaders
8571636 shakhtar are a team that can win all 24 of the remaining matches
8571637 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8571639 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8571640 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8571642 we believe we put forward a strong proposal for an environmentally led mixed use development at hanley grange through the governments eco town initiative which combined housing employment and cutting edge environmental technology
8571643 the site was short listed as one of 15 out of an original 57 sites and we think the proposal had a good prospect of success
8571644 however we recognise a proposal of this type has implications not only for the local area but the region
8571645 we also believe a genuinely sustainable community stands the best chance of being successful if a broad range of stakeholders in the region feel fully engaged in the process leading up to a decision
8571646 i do not think that you productivity will increase by throttling the employees use of the internet slackers will find other ways to slack to my experience when people spent an inordinate amount of time with diversions is when they are either unhappy with their work or have lost focus both are afflictions caused by management or lack of thereof
8571647 but i can say that theyve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus
8571648 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8571649 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8571650 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8571651 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8571652 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8571653 i saw the sign i figured they may prosecute im pretty sure im not abusing the trail
8571654 most of the owners capital goes to providing electricity and fuel
8571655 the process of raising young chickens costs too much and using private power generators is a main part of the production cost which in turn pushes the selling price up
8571656 this is because of many reasons for example the air refreshment system needs electricity to operate farms also need to use fridges and freezers in addition to food preparation machines
8571657 lewis career spanned four olympics in track and field the most global sport and consequently the one featuring the most competition to have won an event like the long jump for four successive olympics is extraordinary
8571658 hey i could be there breathing down tirunesh dibabas neck
8571659 the phrase tactical race was taken to an absurd extreme
8571660 it isnt just events like gymnastics in which points are awarded for style that have aesthetic value an olympic gold medal may be undeniably an olympic gold medal but this was an ugly race
8571661 catherine did not know that constantina was up ahead she did not see her break from the pack when she did and with the turns in the course did not see her ahead she was running in the front of the second group or just behind that lead group when constantina made the move so she could not see it with the crowd so far back from the course due to the security gates the athletes could not receive info as they often do when racing hearing their position in the race so she had no idea she told me when she came around the corner and first saw her she almost stopped from the surprise she thought the medal contenders were in the group she was in
8571662 he ripped off his hip sticker and walked down a tunnel leaving his lane empty the stadium fell into a stunned buzz chinese workers cried a nation fell into anguish liu disappeared from sunlight into shade i thought four years over and thats how it ends
8571663 it was a little heartbreaking because i thought i was going to be in
8571664 i am not built like tirunesh dibaba and meseret defar and i dont have their speed
8571665 now youre a marathoner this is what youre born to do
8571666 women no longer have to be housewives and stay at home there is a change in the way women approach sports and work now it is a career for them
8571667 it was important initially for wanjiru to stay with the lead pack to assess the other runners
8571668 but he did extremely well by taking over the race early
8571669 i struggled with the illness for some time and when we got to the 30 kilometer mark i told wanjiru to go for it and im so happy that he won the gold for kenya
8571670 hes retiring from international athletics thats certain the marathon in beijing was his last appearance for italy
8571671 hes definitely not stopping running hell still do some races here and there such as some events in italy with less stress attached
8571672 the ioc should do something to acknowledge the fact that the east germans were cheating
8571673 i dont know how feasible it is to go back and start changing the order of finishes in all those events its an incredibly complicated issue
8571674 theres only one thing that would be wrong and that is to do nothing which is what the ioc has chosen
8571675 at the half marathon i was 1 06 20 right where i wanted to be
8571676 it does not make you a better runner to stick to wanjiru early at a pace you know you cannot hold it makes you dumb and rash and leads to a dnf smarter and better and very very hard to let him go and run your race hoping wanjiru cant hold pace hats off to wanjiru on the day but that doesnt mean hall was happy just to be there
8571677 all non mesh overlays were removed from the forefoot to suit brians preference for running his marathons with no socks note to brooks maybe you should put those non mesh overlays back in
8571678 im really happy to be the winner here in beijing
8571679 this is history for kenya since 1968 weve been trying but we havent ever won a gold medal in the marathon im really happy to make kenyan history
8571680 i think if i can get a good course like berlin i can run two zero four
8571681 maybe next year i can go there and break the world record
8571682 i thought i had a chance at a medal comments dathan ritzenhein
8571683 but i looked at the clock at 5k and we were already out at i think 14 55 i knew if i kept that up that i wouldnt be finishing
8571684 to be able to come here and finish ninth in the olympics is a step for me
8571685 12 weeks ago i wasnt even running on the ground it took everything i had to get into this kind of shape that quickly
8571686 this has been an amazing journey something we have been working hard on for the last eight years
8571687 we have been saying all along that 2008 was going to be the olympics where we were going to make it happen
8571688 got into a lot of trouble at school it was nothing really really bad but nothing good either i just made bad decisions
8571689 the thought of some little kid saying i want to be a decathlete like bryan clay blows my mind its probably one of the most amazing things in the world
8571690 we go to the 110 meter hurdles and get a silver and a bronze who do we have to beat the world record holder dayron robles
8571691 the 200 meters we get a silver and a bronze who do we have to beat the world record holder usain bolt one two three in the intermediate hurdles wheres that joy we get one two three that we werent expected to in the 400 wheres that joy a gold medal in the decathlon im proud of this bunch theyve worked hard trained hard and have done an incredible job
8571692 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
8571693 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
8571694 ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can
8571695 it was very long to sit and watch the 100m go by and knowing i still had a couple days to go but in the end i look at it and say it was a blessing because i felt very fresh in the 200m
8571696 i always talk about the triple t tradition talent and training in our primary schools physical education is mandatory and we actually start competing from early childhood
8571697 weve put up big screens in the towns and heavily populated areas so everyone can watch everybody has just stopped working to watch the races its a great moment for us
8571698 i thought the best thing to do is just to go there and if i find myself in the front i should just relax and not panic
8571699 i just saw the line and saw the screen and saw that i was going to cross the line before anybody
8571700 my body could not respond i could not kick at all
8571701 i was camping with friends and watched kellys final on tv at the campsite
8571702 i never thought this tv work was something i would do when i retired
8571703 my ex wife just from being around me and listening to me talk about sports said tv would be my future
8571704 winning the olympic final in beijing was not a surprise to me
8571705 anything else would have been a huge disappointment so far i have not had time to celebrate too much i am still motivated to achieve big things
8571706 it was easy to imagine what he must have been going through
8571707 its a pity that we did not get to race each other i was ready for that race
8571708 i wanted to help unfortunate children to give back something to the chinese people who showed me a great support during the games
8571709 last year we started to adjust sprinting mechanics and this year we focused on running 100m and speed training his sprinting ability has shown significant improvement
8571710 the first 20m has been my main problem it takes time to get the technique right i executed it right so i guess thats why hes happy
8571711 the whole idea of jamaica suddenly emerging as a track power in the sprints is a joke
8571712 we have always been close to getting medals the difference is that this time we got medals and it is something that we will continue to do because now that we have set a high goal for ourselves i think london 2012 which we have to start looking at immediately will be another games that jamaica will shine
8571713 did their best to keep the team together and did their best to prepare the team
8571714 she had that drive from within that went unmatched by her peers she has always had that focus to run at the world level
8571715 you have one day every four years to show your hard work and i knew my competitive spirit would take over
8571716 i was trying to savor the moment but then i started to run really fast
8571717 i will welcome him with porridge made of millet bananas groundnuts and yams
8571718 i am very happy for he has done me proud he is our star and icon of hope
8571719 im still young and i believe that i have the potential to be the worlds fastest man
8571720 expecting to make of a move of my own at some point
8571721 stay positive and two hours of running and believe that they the leaders are going to come back
8571722 it was just good to get humbled to go back to the states and realize i have a lot of work to do
8571723 felt like i was trying to force this training to happen
8571724 hoping to get stronger and stronger and peak in four years
8571725 ultimately i just have to chalk another one up to inexperience with one more international championship under my belt i am that much closer to being the runner i know i can be
8571726 every time we came to a hill they were forced to jump off their bikes and sprint up the hills with us in order to keep up
8571727 i was like one of those greek masks wearing either a manic smile or tears
8571728 although i am very happy with many aspects of my olympic experience there is of course a bit of disappointment i am proud of placing seventh in the world but i am competitive and a perfectionist it is hard not to fixate on the final result
8571729 told me to think of these as fun races more
8571730 compulsively entertaining and dramatic but they arent the real olympics either in sports or in spirit
8571731 nbc has really blown it with its prime time coverage especially of the second week its simply not showing us the classic olympic events like the decathlon discus hammer throw javelin high jump long jump or pole vault yeah itll toss in a minute or two of coverage of the winning jump or the last decathlon event but thats kind of like tearing out the last page of war and peace and saying you read it
8571732 are the central stitches in its the olympics vast historic tapestry
8571733 in the beginning i did feel a little more jitters than i did in the first round
8571734 i had to kind of shake them off i knew i needed to react to the gun just focus on me and be quick and attack each hurdle
8571735 it is the hurdles stuff happens lots of people have been trying to put words in my mouth into why i tripped but i cant give a clear explanation
8571736 everything seemed to click in the middle of the race but those hurdles always approach quicker and quicker and you can either slow down and break or keep turning your legs over i turned my legs over and tripped over hurdle nine
8571737 the schools motto labor omnia vincit latin for work conquers all speaks volumes in this respect
8571738 this was a long time coming i knew she was always special im just surprised it took so long to happen
8571739 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
8571740 i ate donuts i slept in late i had beer in the afternoon
8571741 eventually i kind of started to get sloppy and fat and felt like crap
8571742 lewis career spanned four olympics in track and field the most global sport and consequently the one featuring the most competition to have won an event like the long jump for four successive olympics is extraordinary
8571743 hey i could be there breathing down tirunesh dibabas neck
8571744 the phrase tactical race was taken to an absurd extreme
8571745 it isnt just events like gymnastics in which points are awarded for style that have aesthetic value an olympic gold medal may be undeniably an olympic gold medal but this was an ugly race
8571746 catherine did not know that constantina was up ahead she did not see her break from the pack when she did and with the turns in the course did not see her ahead she was running in the front of the second group or just behind that lead group when constantina made the move so she could not see it with the crowd so far back from the course due to the security gates the athletes could not receive info as they often do when racing hearing their position in the race so she had no idea she told me when she came around the corner and first saw her she almost stopped from the surprise she thought the medal contenders were in the group she was in
8571747 he ripped off his hip sticker and walked down a tunnel leaving his lane empty the stadium fell into a stunned buzz chinese workers cried a nation fell into anguish liu disappeared from sunlight into shade i thought four years over and thats how it ends
8571748 it was a little heartbreaking because i thought i was going to be in
8571749 i am not built like tirunesh dibaba and meseret defar and i dont have their speed
8571750 now youre a marathoner this is what youre born to do
8571751 women no longer have to be housewives and stay at home there is a change in the way women approach sports and work now it is a career for them
8571752 it was important initially for wanjiru to stay with the lead pack to assess the other runners
8571753 but he did extremely well by taking over the race early
8571754 i struggled with the illness for some time and when we got to the 30 kilometer mark i told wanjiru to go for it and im so happy that he won the gold for kenya
8571755 hes retiring from international athletics thats certain the marathon in beijing was his last appearance for italy
8571756 hes definitely not stopping running hell still do some races here and there such as some events in italy with less stress attached
8571757 the ioc should do something to acknowledge the fact that the east germans were cheating
8571758 i dont know how feasible it is to go back and start changing the order of finishes in all those events its an incredibly complicated issue
8571759 theres only one thing that would be wrong and that is to do nothing which is what the ioc has chosen
8571760 at the half marathon i was 1 06 20 right where i wanted to be
8571761 well theyre only running its not like youre missing anything
8571762 they are using half people one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
8571763 if youre selling a pc clone with windows you have thousands of competitors out there
8571764 if youre selling a mac the only competition is apple and while apple has become much more competitive in its pricing over the last two or three years it still does charge a premium
8571765 im sorry plaid lad but until you learn to better control your unique abilities youd be as great a danger to us as to our enemies

8571767 they gave me a tour of the health centre one of the most heart wrenching sights ive witnessed in uganda there was only one doctor for the entire camp serving all functions and at any given time there would be hundreds in line sometimes waiting days for treatment foregoing it entirely suffering or dying in the process

8571790 if you had any time with the yankees youve probably been booed

8571797 favres backups havent gotten a lot of time which is a testament to how tough he is both mentally and physically
8571798 you look at matt hasselback and mark brunell when the trade all went down a couple weeks ago that was one of the things i looked at i would love to play this year but historically speaking its not a bad thing to sit back and learn from this guy a little bit
8571799 ill be as ready to play as i always am
8571800 basically its an opportunity for younger players to go up against the best players on the team
8571801 and all thats going to do is make us better if ive got to throw against darrelle revis and kerry rhodes everyday its going to make me a better football player
8571802 its about being consistent in doing what you do on an everyday basis if the opportunity presents itself to show yourself yeah but youre one eleventh of the defense and thats all you can do

8571815 i come to every grand slam but here you feel special like ive made it here
8571816 i really can do it and ive done it here its an amazing feeling its like this place supports me in some kind of way i dont know how to explain it i just play much more confident here enjoying this city so much the crowd when you play here its a different atmosphere and you just have so much fun being on the court

8571820 im probably more exited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round
8571821 but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches so im happy to be in the third round but im still looking for more
8571822 i have to be realistic in my mind and just be ecstatic to be playing here
8571823 it was only when i got back from china maybe last saturday that i was able to start practicing for singles so to expect i would be out here and be perfect is probably shooting for the stars a little bit too much
8571824 i felt it was a little bit tough for me to get much rhythm out there
8571825 i just feel im timing the ball just a little bit late or a not as perfect as id like it to be if i can get that going i feel i can turn my game around
8571826 im probably more exited than maybe i used to be by getting to the third round
8571827 but i feel when im in a tournament and im competing and im healthy that i should be winning some of these matches so im happy to be in the third round but im still looking for more

8571832 thats huge for us were young on the defensive side of the ball but we expect a lot of thaddeus in leading these guys
8571833 the defensive backs are looking like the best weve had since ive been here so i dont think teams are going to score a lot on us i think were going to be real solid this year on the defensive side
8571834 were still young but were young with experience because of the injuries we had last year
8571835 in the regular season i think we could beat everybody on our schedule
8571836 come playoff time i think we could surprise a lot of people
8571837 thats huge for us were young on the defensive side of the ball but we expect a lot of thaddeus in leading these guys
8571838 the defensive backs are looking like the best weve had since ive been here so i dont think teams are going to score a lot on us i think were going to be real solid this year on the defensive side

8571841 come playoff time i think we could surprise a lot of people
8571842 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8571843 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8571844 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8571845 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8571846 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8571847 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8571848 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8571849 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8571902 nous avons d j un gros probl me de paludisme et le changement climatique va le rendre encore plus difficile la temp rature influe sur la survie des moustiques et sur les parasites qui transmettent le paludisme lint rieur des moustiques en gros plus il fait chaud et plus le taux dinfection est haut
8571903 dans de nombreux cas la bact rie qui infecte leau ou la nourriture survit mieux une temp rature plus lev e mais laugmentation du nombre dinondations et surtout de s cheresses va contaminer les sources deau par exemple en p riode de s cheresse les gens stockent de leau pendant plus longtemps ou se lavent moins les mains
8571904 un de nos plus gros soucis est la sous nutrition cest le principal facteur de mauvaise sant et elle tue 3 5 millions de personnes par an avec le changement climatique la production alimentaire devrait augmenter l g rement dans les pays riches mais devrait baisser autour de l quateur ceux qui en ont le plus besoin en auront moins
8571905 on est daccord sur le constat mais il y a un d fi comment se d velopper et moins polluer cest difficile
8571906 les pays africains sont ceux qui ont le moins contribu au changement climatique et ce sont eux qui en souffrent le plus
8571907 nous ne voulons en aucun cas compromettre la lutte contre la pauvret dans les pays les plus pauvres les pays riches qui ont contribu la plus grande partie du probl me doivent faire le premier pas

8571911 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8571912 knows both the opportunities and the pitfalls and you want that experience
8571913 daschle added that obama might have to disaggregate his comprehensive health care and energy proposals to pass them piece by piece
8571914 has drawn more attention in this presidential campaign than in recent elections
8571915 political reality is that health care reform is just one of many issues on voters minds and even then expanding coverage matters less than controlling the rise in health care costs

8571925 the dominance of western states in labor market performance is clearly seen in the record of employment growth over the past five years
8571926 michigan is the only jurisdiction that showed negative employment growth over the past five years while mississippi and west virginia both had growth rates below one percent
8571927 right to work states did well on the overall labor market performance index six of the top 10 positions and 10 of the top 20 jurisdictions were right to work states even though they represent just more than one third of the total number of jurisdictions
8571928 the split between private and public sector employment is an important aspect of labor market performance since the incentives productivity and performance of labor activity in the private sector is different from that in the public sector
8571929 high levels of public sector employment lead to lower productivity which is particularly problematic given that workers in the public sector tend to receive a wage premium compared to their private sector counterparts
8571930 we achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher with signs of slowing demand particularly in spain the us and uk consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of growth for the second half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets

8571979 it was a deeply moving and humbling experience ive never been in a performance like this ever and perhaps the audience too had never felt like this before the entire venue was sold out we all got standing ovations the audience just freaked out
8571980 lets admit it the crowds came in such huge numbers mainly to see the big b we were the side attractions the way the audiences everywhere reacted to him had to be seen to be believed

8571991 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8571992 while it was a difficult quarter we were successful in reducing our domestic inventory levels by 500 million which should lead to lower markdowns and favorably impact our gross margin rates in the second half of the year
8571993 we expect to generate higher ebitda in the second half of this year as compared to the corresponding period in 2007 as we benefit from our lower domestic inventory levels and continued vigilant expense management given our year to date results and the state of the economy our current full year ebitda forecast which assumes flat to modest comparable store sales declines for the rest of the year is comparable to but no longer exceeds last years ebitda
8571994 despite the difficult economic environment we remain focused on long term value creation and continue to invest in the future of the company since last year we have added 65 net stores which consist of home appliance showrooms dealer stores and outlet stores and we have continued to expand our online and multi channel capabilities in may we added a huge selection of books dvds music and software to sears com nearly quadrupling the number of products available

8571999 now the modalities including venues and dates for the tri series is being worked out but tentatively it should start from september 12
8572000 we are not going to adopt a tit for tat policy because the decision to postpone champions trophy was in the end unanimous people dont realise that pakistan has still got the hosting rights and it was because of strong stand taken by some boards that the tournament was not relocated to sri lanka

8572019 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8572020 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8572021 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8572022 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8572023 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8572024 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8572025 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8572026 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8572027 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8572030 we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities

8572047 this is uncharted territory there are a lot of creative ways to aggressively go after a creditor if you are a creditor you have to ask whether its best to play ball with ken lewis or play tough
8572048 it brings everybody out in the open theyll only have 90 days after the announcement to file any more claims
8572049 it makes sense for b of a to make countrywide detachable so that its legal problems do not affect the entire enterprise
8572050 the threat of bankruptcy might give b of a some leverage in negotiating with the plaintiffs attorneys but the threat is a bit of a bluff unless bank of america is willing to lose control of countrywide

8572072 man can never be hindered from not doing certain actions especially if he is prepared to die rather than to do evil
8572073 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8572074 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8572075 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8572076 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8572077 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8572078 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness location far east manchester

8572085 open source vendors start making money from their customer base precisely at the point that the customer base is least likely to renew
8572086 howlett suggests that software vendors are right to charge a big upfront license fee as it helps to defray the high initial cost of supporting a customers deployment of the software
8572087 open source vendors get around this by pushing for multi year agreements which is a way of evening out risk and fairly apportioning it between vendor and buyer
8572088 on the it buyers side a subscriptions price is likely to be higher on an annual basis than the maintenance on a proprietary license in the first year a subscription is dramatically cheaper but over five years or how about just in the second year or third its no longer so clear cut
8572089 if dennis is right and customers turn against enterprise software support and maintenance models then how many customers are going to be able to distinguish commercial license plus support subscription from commercial license plus maintenance contract
8572090 this poses a serious long term threat to oak trees in some areas almost all oaks have been affected
8572091 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8572092 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8572093 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8572094 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8572095 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8572148 we suspect that the cards that were handed over to the masaka nrm leaders were among those that went missing recently from our headquarters in kampala
8572149 all their faces were strange because i know the majority of the dp supporters in masaka it seems they were from nrm
8572150 expanding university education is very important but when graduates begin trotting on the streets looking for jobs this shows that something is not right
8572151 the rate of unemployment in the country is increasing because the curriculum does not favour the economic standards of the country
8572152 why are you asking me about the speech this guy already has given four of the best speeches anyone can remember he doesnt need my help i just want to hear what he comes up with this time
8572153 he needs to talk about the future and whats really at stake not just in november but long term
8572154 especially how were going to get jobs back in this country
8572155 i expect to hear how hes going to address the breakdown in washington the things that have kept us from getting our levees repaired and he has to talk about the way the bush administration has squandered the united states reputation as the great hope of the world
8572156 he can unite the country not just the party because he represents the diversity and unity that we have there
8572157 is how were going to bring the country back so much has happened to people in the last few years and people need to have some hope of a comeback
8572158 he has to reach out to the clinton delegates and embrace them he has to do it himself for the sake of the millions who supported her and who cant be here i expect him to talk about the economy and iraq but first he better talk to us
8572159 he has to say again as he did when he first announced that this election is not about me its really about you and what kind of future you and your family will have its important he speak to independents they are the largest party now in colorado
8572160 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation
8572161 in some way the mccain people would love to see this as a repeat of reagan versus carter in 1980 where reagan got to run as the candidate of america and carter was the candidate of complexity and no answers
8572162 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union
8572163 another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality
8572164 toxic and dangerous effects of a neocon unilateralist style that has nearly shattered our alliances and made americans weaker
8572165 i dont think it has the same resonance and intellectual honesty that it had in an earlier era
8572166 the public feels the republicans have been quite reckless on these things
8572167 in the modern political imagination orange is a color of a successful revolution
8572168 senator biden agreed that barack obama was unprepared to be president
8572169 i think hillary clinton called it naive senator biden called it irresponsible
8572170 what we dont know is if she thinks hes qualified to be commander in chief
8572171 once hes elected hes going to have to spend a whole lot of time with the speaker nancys influence is not going to be surpassed by any event or any person
8572172 i have in my brain an idea that democrats are going to be in the majority for a while so get used to it
8572173 it is going to be a time of positive constructive change
8572174 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired

8572184 nunca descarto a los yanquis antes de que termine la temporada y las posiciones est n definidas
8572185 llevan mucho tiempo en esto y han estado en los playoffs tanto tiempo que definitivamente no los descontamos
8572186 esto fue una gran gran victoria para nosotros simple y sencillamente por la forma en que perdimos antenoche
8572187 pudimos haber soportado perder pero nunca se sabe ad nde puede llevar ese tipo de derrotas
8572188 fue un esfuerzo de equipo no fue cosa de un chico o un lanzador hicieron un trabajo formidable
8572189 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8572190 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8572191 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8572192 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8572193 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8572194 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8572195 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8572196 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8572197 why hasnt apple the most innovative and visionary company in computing produced a single concept product or vision in over a decade because to paraphrase jobs real artists ship
8572198 ping fm is a simple service that makes updating your social networks a snap
8572199 the odds are pretty high we wont get to 60 but its not out of the question
8572200 the chatter about whether democrats can pick up enough seats in november to hit the magic number of 60 and a filibuster proof majority is getting louder
8572201 its not as good as 60 but its close enough to get a lot done
8572202 there are a lot of aspects that look like a right wing think tank im very worried about that possibility
8572203 people are concerned about the blurring of the line between friedmans technical work in economics and his fairly well known persona as a political advocate of a very pure free market conservative or neoliberal position where the market is the solution to everything
8572204 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8572205 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway we will bring in people from all over the world with all different approaches
8572206 talking more broadly about the intellectual portfolio of the university
8572207 just looking at those numbers its way too early to call the race
8572208 were not going to finish counting absentee and provisional ballots until september 5th
8572209 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8572210 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
8572211 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
8572212 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
8572213 nobody here saw a childhood we were always kept indoors but we dont believe that the solution is in the gun now we want to show the world that kashmiris deserve peace
8572214 india calls itself the worlds largest functioning democracy but if we are really a democracy cant we let people express their dissent
8572215 in every other part of the country police or army fire tear gas or rubber bullets during agitations why do they shoot first and ask questions later in kashmir
8572216 i think its a mistake on the part of a company to think that simply because they enroll that they are going to be protected from any kind of government audit or raid
8572217 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8572218 embrace it sure its like the beautiful girl i cant reach but id love to embrace her
8572219 unless we give them a filibuster proof senate majority that can finally end the obstruction well never put this country back on track
8572220 we are proud to have passed the most aggressive and innovative energy platform in republican party history
8572221 increasing americas energy independence is an issue of critical importance to our nation and its an issue on which john mccain has demonstrated strong and continued leadership with his all of the above approach
8572222 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
8572223 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8572224 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount
8572225 the most diplomatic way of saying it is that there are just a lot of moving parts
8572226 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
8572227 we dont forecast the ports our ships are going to be pulling into
8572228 the ships are performing duties on maintaining peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8572229 among the duties we are performing is control over abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of the trafficking in arms we are also carrying out a humanitarian mission
8572230 they were all members of a family who had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8572231 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8572232 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8572233 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area
8572234 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8572235 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8572236 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8572237 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8572238 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8572239 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8572240 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8572241 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8572242 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8572243 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8572244 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8572245 you can talk all you want about policies and programs but thats not what people respond to
8572246 people respond when they are touched emotionally and thats what hes so good at its going to be very important in his speech tomorrow night that people get excited emotionally thats what they want from him
8572247 you didnt even think about it you didnt talk about it
8572248 people were struggling struggling for the right to vote to end segregation in many parts of the american south people were so afraid they were afraid to be afraid
8572249 as the drama of the primary unfolded more and more what barack obamas campaign did and what it was saying to the country and to me personally was so akin to the movement
8572250 the revolution is at hand and we must free ourselves of the chains of political and economic slavery
8572251 to those who have said be patient and wait we must say that patience is a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually we want our freedom and we want it now we cannot depend on any political party for both the democrats and the republicans have betrayed the basic principles of the declaration of independence
8572252 first of all i think shes so smart so gifted but shes also been a wonderful friend along with her husband theyve been like family and i thought she would make a great president
8572253 some people think barack obama just appeared on the scene overnight but it was a movement a struggle that produced this man that created a climate for this personality to emerge
8572254 in him is the embodiment of the hopes and dreams and aspirations and suffering of so many people people say hes not of the civil rights movement but hes a byproduct of that movement and theres no way you can forget that
8572255 yes i blog under my name boring right but this is who i am i dont blog under a handler i dont do that im pam
8572256 the next leg of the journey for women had to be focused on economic security
8572257 hes the first person from the tri state peninsula to ever be on a presidential ticket
8572258 a lot of people are still uncomfortable with him including hispanics with us its what they call la coraz n the heart and we want to feel like we know him hes leading mccain 2 to 1 among hispanics two to one it should be 80 to 20
8572259 the thing about hispanics is once you get us shaking and grooving once you get us hooked were set were there but were not there yet
8572260 i think his goal is to talk to the american people directly about the challenges we face
8572261 i wanted to reserve my focus for his candidacy and the ticket
8572262 his problem is not a friend who makes a mistake im his ally the problem is not the accidental embarrassment but the intentional attempts to destroy him
8572263 barack hes not petty hes not a petty guy im quick to support and defend him and his family
8572264 when you talk about the dream you miss the violence of that day it was a very violent period
8572265 kennedy didnt want the march to take place d c was on a military lockdown that day
8572266 we are looking forward with great expectation to a wide variety of creative responses to our brief and we expect the talent arcade will unearth a number of talented individuals with the passion and skill to succeed in the games industry
8572267 we know there is an abundance of creative people in scotland and we would like to give those people a chance to shine and fulfil their potential
8572268 the four winners will be catapaulted into the scottish games industry with the best possible advice contacts training and opportunities 3mrt cohort studios tag games and tpld are very dynamic forward thinking companies with a huge amount to offer trainees so were delighted to be working with them on talent arcade
8572269 people used to be like oh you are a red state
8572270 they didnt give us any respect we sat way up in the stands everyone knows where virginia is now
8572271 this is shaping up to be the best convention yet
8572272 one hundred years later the negro is still languishing in the corners of american society
8572273 what this shows is that everyone has the same opportunity here
8572274 hopefully will mean that weve crossed a bridge into a time when race doesnt matter
8572275 i think theres still a lot of latent racism among all of us but i think its a hopeful hopeful sign
8572276 people are going to look at him obama and say maybe i can run for office for any office
8572277 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8572278 tell him to give me a quick call tell him not to forget the little people
8572279 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8572280 you pick up on the energy of your surroundings its much more like my old job i can really loosen up
8572281 a crazy media spin cycle that was sort of surreal to watch
8572282 the perfect vehicle for her to spread her wings a little bit
8572283 we expect to see this kind of behavior in myanmar not in denver colorado at a national political convention where a reporter is trying to videotape big money donors trying to meet with elected officials
8572284 go home al jazeera voices for al qaeda and bin laden
8572285 al jazeera is the no 1 propaganda machine for the enemies we fight
8572286 they think im bringing in terrorists to launch a jihad in the little town of golden
8572287 i guess you could call it a mild jihad for the truth
8572288 this isnt the first time this kind of thing has happened
8572289 my home is 1 a zero carbon home 2 a museum of net zero carbon transportation 3 a victorian bicycle museum i will cook the bar b que in the 2 solar ovens
8572290 im welcoming to any international visitors coming to visit us in peace
8572291 its a city theyre people they should have a vote
8572292 i talk about it because our sense of pride gives hope for other individuals too that kind of hope and pride inspires other people into action
8572293 for those who do not want to have that dialogue i recognize that but for those of us who are proud of this moment we are not going to squash that
8572294 if she were alive she would be immensely proud of my being the first african american mayor of columbus
8572295 but she would not have even conceived of the possibility that a black man or woman a person of color could become president of these united states of america
8572296 you dont run from your roots you embrace your past and you represent everybody
8572297 i couldnt believe what i was seeing now for me to be here
8572298 but with older people theres no way if you were born in my time and world to think that you would see this happen
8572299 there were certain things we knew we couldnt do you could have the second best grades but you knew when you were pushing up to the line and crossing over it
8572300 there are some people here that are afraid this may in some way take away from their status but this is not a black thing or a white thing
8572301 there are some majority people who are afraid of that but if were not all rowing in the same rhythm were going to go in a circle
8572302 being an african american and not being sensitive to the historic nature of this is just a fallacy
8572303 ive always been involved in politics but i always had to settle for this is the first time in my adult life ive been really excited this is going to show that americas precepts are not just rhetoric
8572304 its not so much that hes black thats why it is historic but thats not why people are excited whats exciting is that he is transcending
8572305 shut the f up current mood bullied i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8572306 gerade in jugendgottesdiensten und auf kirchentagen haben die traditionellen gotteslob lieder beinahe ausgedient
8572307 wir haben schon im priesterseminar angefangen mit rhythmischen psalmen in unserem kurs in dem brigens auch weihbischof helmut bauer war
8572308 das hat sich dann bald durchgesetzt und ist bis heute fester bestandteil der kirchenmusik dar ber bin ich sehr froh
8572309 er hat nicht gerade purzelb ume geschlagen vor begeisterung und als die gro e trommel dr hnte da hat er erst ein wenig ngstlich geschaut aber er hat das nie ger gt
8572310 mit dem sind wir dann am wochenende hinaus in die st dte und haben etwa die dekanatstage mitgestaltet oder auch den di zesantag in w rzburg
8572311 da haben wir wirklich die ganze stadtjugend auf die beine gebracht und tanzmusik gemacht von den beatles bis zu improvisationen
8572312 since this is a rural area we realised that farming is the best economic activity these piglets and chicks are for rearing not for eating any important citizen must have a source of income to contribute towards the development of the country
8572313 we are glad that you have not only fought poverty among the orphans but also brought economic development in the area
8572314 have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8572315 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8572316 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8572317 saying i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8572318 the taxi drivers who would be transporting for johannesburg and pretoria are not doing so
8572319 its a pilot project if it goes okay it might be implemented on other routes
8572320 they utilise the cash that is in hand if there is no more cash they see no more incentive in driving the taxi
8572321 they will sit down and resolve this thing they must meet halfway
8572322 that is an employer employee relationship we are not party to that
8572323 there was a decision that was handed down that we need to give united routes this was in error because the routes belong to civic centre taxi association
8572324 we as government cannot be seen to be fuelling violence
8572325 we cannot have united coming in to invade we are in close contact with the police and they will monitor the routes we have been told there are some incidents of violence taking place we leave that to law enforcement
8572326 michael recently proposed to his girlfriend erin muller but theyre keeping it quiet for the moment
8572327 ben stiller is one of the great talents of american entertainment a memorable actor an accomplished director and writer an emmy award winner and an innovative producer
8572328 the sale is a great business decision we are delighted we look forward to expanding the brand even further to chicago and tokyo
8572329 even when women are aggrieved according to our culture men have to speak on their behalf
8572330 as women we have the right to freedom of expression life treatment and care which is what we are calling for through this march
8572331 im here with my wife and two children because i hope this march is going to touch governments heart
8572332 besides the fact that we take arvs antiretrovirals on an empty stomach the tablets are now rationed
8572333 we used to get 60 tablets to last us the whole month but now that has been halved because we are told that the arvs are not enough to give the months supply
8572334 while the country is affected by a number of socio economic challenges we find it inappropriate for government to finance some activities that are neither priority nor of interest such as the trip that has been undertaken by emakhosikati to his majesty the king children aides bodyguards and their maids
8572335 however we have not seen any concerted efforts by government to build more classrooms to accommodate the number of children into school no increase in the uptake of teachers to cater for the increased number of children in schools and we have no additional budget for school equipment and materials to cater for the high number of children
8572336 we would be less concerned about this particular trip if it was not funded by the central bank which is money from the taxpayer
8572337 what is depressing is that it is the same minister who allocated and approved the funds for the trip of the nine wives their children bodyguards and relatives who have left the country to various international destinations
8572338 if what they are complaining about is reversible then we can reverse and if we cant reverse it government will see what can be done so that it doesnt happen again
8572339 seeds of peace is the best experience that ever happened to me
8572340 this is the only place that you can be with people from different cultures and countries and talk very honestly
8572341 we thought the weight was off everyones shoulders and now we were just going to work on making the peace happen
8572342 but you know young people have a spirit about them an optimism that just cant be quelled that easily
8572343 for so many of these kids coming here is what it took to hear the other side of the story
8572344 i think that this basic level exposure has a really strong impact on the future
8572345 things dont end after you leave camp actually you have more to do when it finishes
8572346 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8572347 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8572348 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8572349 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8572350 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8572351 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8572352 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8572400 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8572401 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8572402 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis

8572416 i could be doing so much more with my life with that in mind im going to come up with my own list of things i want to accomplish before i die and set out to achieve them sometimes you just gotta live like you were dying

8572422 i think that the character should be the primary focus and not the class
8572423 to hit with a power that has the cold keyword
8572424 a power that deals acid damage has the acid keyword
8572425 any time you hit a monster having used a power with the cold keyword sometime earlier that day
8572426 the other keywords define the fundamental effects of a power for instance a power that deals acid damage is an acid effect and thus has the acid keyword
8572427 when a feat provides a benefit related to using a power that has a keyword that benefit applies when you use a power of a magic item as well as when you use a power granted by your class your race or another feat
8572428 when attacking a creature that is vulnerable to cold you gain combat advantage when you use a power that has the cold keyword
8572429 any target you hit with a power that has the cold keyword gains vulnerable cold 5 until the end of your next turn
8572430 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you

8572450 overall we had a good balance and the response was clear
8572451 the unique event aims to draw members of the general public who may not normally be attracted to green events
8572452 its time to do something positive and i believe dedicated eco events like this create an educational and captivating platform to do just that the show will offer the opportunity to participate debate and leave with more than food for thought about how individually and collectively we can all mitigate the dire consequences of runaway climate chaos and become part of the change for a better future

8572455 as a starting point nie your energy will be giving out thousands of free energy saving bulbs to visitors to the show we will also have details of grants and schemes to help with the cost of things like household insulation helping people reduce their energy use and therefore their carbon footprint

8572473 you are talking about blood money this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money
8572474 our officers are at the initial stages of our investigation into the shillingtons bridge fish kill but the early indications are that this is not connected to the one yesterday at moneypennys lock
8572475 significant numbers of coarse fish and pike have been killed in this incident across a mile of river
8572476 the bulk of the fish appear to have been dead for several days although a few live and distressed fish are still visible
8572477 our staff are working hard to establish this exact cause of the incident
8572478 once again the agency would urge anyone who knows anything about this fish kill to help our investigation
8572479 the number of workless households is down 15 000 on the year and 185 000 since 1997 as more and more people are being supported off benefits and into work weve cut unemployment to almost half what it was a decade ago and the numbers on out of work benefits have fallen by over a million
8572480 since 1997 the number of children in workless households in the uk has fallen by over 480 000 to help children we must help their families and for families work is the most important route out of poverty
8572481 most of the people who work in these areas are aware of the dangers
8572482 a lot of companies for years have got computers going out in an afternoon and new ones coming in but they havent got the time to completely wipe the old ones
8572483 so what they have done in the past is just dump the machines
8572484 but even machines in a landfill is a danger if people get the hard disk it could contain anything
8572485 the hard drives unless they are wiped down in a professional secure manner will always have information which can be recovered by people who know how to do it
8572486 businesses and organisations have to be on their toes most information now is stored on discs criminals dont need that much information
8572487 we have to have confidence that the people in these government departments organisations or companies know the proper procedures to follow when getting rid of their old computers
8572488 these incidents do rock peoples faith in government departments banks and organisations when incidents like this happen
8572489 this can put us at greater risk of identity theft as the potential for security breaches and subsequently loss of personal data increases regardless of how careful we are with our details
8572490 if it had not been for the professional and calm actions of the driver we would have been talking about the death and serious injuries of fire officers this morning
8572491 we received a number of calls at 11 30pm saying a caravan was on fire in a garden at juniper rise in twinbrook
8572492 as the fire crew from lisburn road station were making their way along stewartstown road they could see a ferocious blaze in the distance that is when they came under attack the crew proceeded on to the house where they courageously tackled the fire
8572493 there had been an explosion and the fire had spread to the house the occupant was suffering from smoke inhalation and shock no doubt if the crew had not continued on to the scene the incident would have escalated and endangered the life of the occupant
8572494 thirty years of feminism have emancipated women but emasculated men while girls gained their freedom to sleep with whom they wanted and to succeed in any career they chose to pursue boys were gradually formed by social pressure into what women confused and giddy with their new found freedom thought they wanted their men to be
8572495 the family unit will become happier and stronger as we play our natural roles
8572496 there will be a return to the stable marriages of the fifties and sixties as the man feels free to do things he wants to do and to be himself

8572503 unsere ziele sind einfach werte erhalten und zwar durch fokus auf ein traditionsorientiertes kerngesch ft in dem aus unserer sicht viel potenzial schlummert von riskanten und unausgegorenen konzepten wie einer beteiligung der net mobile ag und den damit zu erwartenden riskanten operativen schritten halten wir herzlich wenig
8572504 wir sind gegen ber jedem der als investor zu uns kommen will sehr aufgeschlossen
8572505 obwohl ein einstieg von staatsfonds bei siemens auf den ersten blick als positiv zu werten ist kann dies dem kurs nur kurzfristig helfen aus diesem grund sollte man die ank ndigung des managements nicht berbewerten

8572510 isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust
8572511 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8572512 indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8572513 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation

8572524 you should be able to make a joke about anybody without them taking offence thats whats wrong with comedy now it has gone too politically correct
8572525 i have done more television in the past 12 months than when i was the bbcs brightest discovery
8572526 i have done so much television it is not true i dont think any of us has ever not been in work
8572527 but there is that peculiar belief that if you are not on television you must be starving
8572528 i suspect that todays breaking news that there are more people over the age of 80 than we have children hasnt filtered through to television executives who have come from media studies rather than actually doing something when i say this people say he wants his show back on but i dont because it was damn hard work
8572529 we are the last of the line of the vaudeville performers
8572530 there has been no variety on television for the past 10 years it has just been reality what is sad is that people have never seen a juggler or a balancing act they have never heard the street comic
8572531 audiences have got easier than they were in the seventies or eighties there was so much competition then but everyone has not got the same taste and people have the right to like what they like
8572532 it is very rare for anyone to get to win a gold medal for their country athletes do it but singers dont often so it is a great honour to be doing this best of british

8572538 a amp e staff and our facilities staff across the trust are to be commended for their handling of this incident they both contained the situation and placed patient safety first at all times
8572539 our staff team was quick to react and with the aid of the collaborative efforts of the a amp e staff and site managers our own security team and close work with the psni the situation was defused
8572540 the western trust are committed to running a robust and safe service at the altnagelvin site both for patients and staff the trust will be investigating this incident further
8572541 the police received a report from a member of hospital staff that a drunk male was in the patient room with a handgun police officers arrived by which stage he had moved into a treatment room
8572542 the defendant was challenged by three officers who had their firearms drawn he was arrested and taken to strand road police station during his police interview he said he had bought the bb gun for his 13 year old son at the lammas fair in ballycastle earlier in the day
8572543 the imitation gun was in a box but after drinking eight pints of beer he made his way back to derry and went to altnagelvin hospital with the gun clearly visible tucked inside his waistband
8572544 the police accept that he was not waving the imitation firearm around in the hospital and they accept it was not his intention to be violent it is not a case of causing havoc in a hospital ward
8572545 not welcome here and they are not welcome in iraq
8572546 jingoistic celebration of an illegal war launched over false claims about weapons of mass destruction by bush and blair
8572547 we have opposed the wars in iraq and afghanistan from the outset it is estimated that over half a million innocent men women and children have been killed by allied forces and we dont feel it is right to glorify those deaths
8572548 the british army should hang their head in shame not expect a civic reception at the expense of the rate payers of limavady borough
8572549 what about the illegal war that the ira waged and the number of innocent protestants killed by the ira and still being targeted by dissidents
8572550 what about the innocent people who were killed the civilians the policemen the school teachers murdered by the ira thugs in northern ireland
8572551 we did not want a parade all we wanted was to honour these people from the ta and rir who had served in afghanistan and iraq and especially the ones from in and around limavady there are quite a few people i know who have served there this wasnt supposed to be political or contentious whether you agreed with the war or not i know an awful lot of members of the roman catholic faith serving in the rir and people from the south of ireland serving in afghanistan and iraq
8572552 this shows there is no such thing among councillors in limavady
8572553 the westlink is strategically a very important route and it was opened with great fanfare and welcome a few months ago and to find that in the first serious weather incident it is completely flooded out is a huge concern

8572560 are crime scene photos where children are being subjected to sexual abuse
8572561 if i were to take a woman to a hotel room commit rape and take a picture no one would call that pornography
8572562 but over the past nine years the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic theres little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities it has done such a disservice to children
8572563 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea

8572567 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8572568 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8572569 the low pressure system really starts to fizzle out over the next 24 hours

8572579 barack obama will work for an america with more partners and fewer adversaries he will rebuild our frayed alliances and revitalize the international institutions which help to share the costs of the worlds problems and to leverage our power and influence he will put us back in the forefront of the worlds fight to reduce nuclear chemical and biological weapons and to stop global warming he will continue and enhance our nations global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tb and malaria including a renewal of the battle against hiv aids here at home he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort but in a world troubled by terror by trafficking in weapons drugs and people by human rights abuses by other threats to our security our interests and our values when he cannot convert adversaries into partners he will stand up to them
8572580 barack obama also will not allow the worlds problems to obscure its opportunities everywhere in rich and poor countries alike hardworking people need good jobs secure affordable healthcare food and energy quality education for their children and economically beneficial ways to fight global warming these challenges cry out for american ideas and american innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create new jobs for our people
8572581 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8572582 look at the example the republicans have set american workers have given us consistently rising productivity theyve worked harder and produced more what did they get in return declining wages less than as many new jobs as in the previous eight years smaller health care and pension benefits rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s american families by the millions are struggling with soaring health care costs and declining coverage i will never forget the parents of children with autism and other severe conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldnt afford health care and couldnt qualify their kids for medicaid unless they quit work or got a divorce are these the family values the republicans are so proud of what about the military families pushed to the breaking point by unprecedented multiple deployments what about the assault on science and the defense of torture what about the war on unions and the unlimited favors for the well connected what about katrina and cronyism
8572583 america can do better than that and barack obama will
8572584 the choice is clear the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8572585 my fellow democrats sixteen years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8572586 i suffered mentally every day i felt trapped between sanity and madness and i had no idea that everyone was watching my naked body all this time it shouldnt be allowed but to be fair theyve just given me hot miso soup and a bowl of rice and pickled plums so ive agreed to go to south korea and repeat the challenge

8572599 every time miike pushes us farther than we thought we could go it ratchets it up a level by either growing even more violent or by disarming our shock with a bit of morbid humor
8572600 for many this is the quintessential miike film a hyper stylised visceral barrage of over the top gore torture and rape which hangs loosely on a threadbare skeleton of inconsequential plotting and that boasts a madmans sense of logic

8572615 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
8572616 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses

8572618 we need to learn again that we are a people with a story to tell if the gospel really is as lesslie newbigin never tired of reminding us the story of the world and everything in it then we have the grandest greatest story of all to tell but we have reduced that gospel to a four point outline that perhaps generates a nod of assent yet rarely provokes the response of breath taking wonder no surprise men and women flock to other tales told of human existence we have bored them to death what will it take for the church to give rise to a new generation of story tellers who can capture the imagination of our culture where are the christian novelists playwrights artists and musicians who separately and together retell the tale of gods way with the world in such a manner that even as the world shouts it cant be true it whispers but it must be it has to be

8572635 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8572636 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 percent
8572637 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8572638 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8572639 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8572640 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8572641 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8572642 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8572643 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8572644 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected
8572645 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8572646 oil markets are waiting for gustav and waiting to go on holiday
8572647 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8572648 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8572649 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8572650 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8572651 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness

8572653 we know how popular the albany was as a venue for local people and for visitors to glasgow

8572655 the concentration of tall buildings in that area gives it a mini manhattan feel which is positive
8572656 tall buildings can be fantastic or can simply be bland but the reputation of these architects goes before them and i am confident they will produce something which will do glasgow proud
8572657 the site has been cleared and i am very keen to see development take place that said i think there needs to be further discussions with planning officers to sort out some of the details of this application not least the proposed height of the building

8572660 the farmers almanac is predicting a colder than normal winter and more snow
8572661 so i have people who not only want to save money on their heat bill but they want to stay warm
8572662 we ordered ten semi loads and weve already sold seven and its august
8572663 were thinking probably by the middle of september well be all sold out of the wood pellets we have coming
8572664 and you can insulate it and you can put in big windows but its still a big old house on the prairie and it takes a lot to heat it
8572665 if prices stay the way they are the payback is three years
8572666 if the prices drop significantly five to six years and thats not bad
8572667 weve actually had dealers that have sold as many furnaces in the first half of the year as they sold all last year and the normal heating season busy time is really just barely starting
8572668 they are doing their normal marketing things and the fuel prices have really sped up the decision process for people
8572669 theyre not waiting as long because they are concerned they may not be able to get a wood furnace if they wait too long because the demand is so high
8572670 weve actually since probably late march weve been having a lot of inquires for firewood and i would say our business is up as much as 20 percent this year
8572671 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8572672 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc
8572673 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8572674 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8572675 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8572676 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward

8572678 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role

8572685 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8572686 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage

8572694 i think its inevitable twenty20 will be an olympic sport
8572695 the international olympic committee could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8572696 its big look at our line up and imagine something even bigger
8572697 i noticed the difference from the first moment we turned up in scotland and did a fielding drill and straight away i noticed it was different
8572698 the energy the buzz the skill levels and the fitness of the guys was different which is not saying it was bad when i was in the squad before but there has been an increase in intensity definitely and its fantastic
8572699 i dont think it happens overnight but its down to a lot of hard work i havent been here for a while so i dont know what the talk has been like behind closed doors but i imagine the difference is down to hard work
8572700 its something i have always believed in that the harder you work in the end you will get what you deserve but its not just about hard work its about being clever with it working on specific skills that might make the difference in the game like hitting the stumps and things like that
8572701 having worked with peter at sussex he is very keen on making sure were fit energetic and are getting our skill levels up
8572702 the team also has to buy into it so the individuals also have to think this is going to make a difference and make us better its a team effort to make those decisions and get better
8572703 the message will be weve done nothing yet and thats quite important

8572720 this is our only fundraiser and we do it very well

8572722 the participating artists are very generous and we are extremely grateful to them
8572723 i think this indicates their dedication to the omaa and their support of all that we do in the way of exhibitions and programs

8572752 i cant quite place where my skills as a creator of machine art came from
8572753 or where i first got the idea to start drawing them

8572757 for the iraqis life among the americans often meant living a double life the one they thought the americans wanted to see and the real one they lived when the americans went home
8572758 the audacity of deceit barack obamas war on american values
8572759 im still in a way feeling like that big guy that 37 stone man
8572760 i look at myself and its like another person inside of me i lie in bed and its all hanging over

8572775 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8572776 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8572777 but with the advent of the fact checking obsessed blogosphere
8572778 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8572779 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8572780 our command was aware the lebanese army was conducting a three day manoeuvres in the area
8572781 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8572782 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish

8572784 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8572785 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8572786 we are looking at the current shift towards fuel efficient cars in the united states as a structural change in demand
8572787 we intend to respond quickly and flexibly to this environment

8572793 when compared side by side to an 8700 model it is approximately 2 3 the width of an 8700 and approx 1 4 inches longer
8572794 some kid back in town traded the van for it straight up i can get 70 miles to the gallon on this hog
8572795 you know lloyd just when i think you couldnt possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this and totally redeem yourself haha
8572796 hey lets sign a guy who cant play for four weeks if we start off 0 4 im sure once we get henry back things will change
8572797 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8572798 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8572799 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8572800 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8572801 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8572802 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8572803 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8572804 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8572805 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8572806 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8572807 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8572808 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8572809 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8572810 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8572811 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8572812 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8572813 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8572814 you know i could practice in my bathing suit instead of a leo
8572815 i always wondered what happened to emma and her family
8572816 i was shocked but it was a good feeling to actually speak to her its very unusual to meet the people we help so long after the event
8572817 the fire started in the kitchen and was well alight when we got there it started burning through into the bedroom above and the house was full of smoke
8572818 firefighters always work as a team but i was the one who went into the bedroom and carried emma out they wouldnt have lasted long in there
8572819 i have never known the identity of the firefighter who saved me
8572820 to come face to face with him after all these years was an amazing coincidence
8572821 i dont remember much about the fire but he was telling me how quickly the fire spread and how frightened i was
8572822 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8572823 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8572824 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8572825 we have more cars than drivers more homes than families more phones than talkers more tvs than members of the family
8572826 15 of those without the internet said it was due to them not being able to understand how it works so its probably best they never get it because its us lot thatd be round their houses all the time fixing their computers
8572827 we need to talk to russia and to discuss the issue of splinter regions from georgia
8572828 we need to discuss the whole architecture of states around russias western and southern border to avoid committing nato to maintain borders we cannot in practise enforce at an acceptable military cost and to allay russian fears to make russian military action less likely
8572829 we need to see how big the disagreements are and to assess if any other state apart from georgia is in danger of a russian invasion so far the west has not won over enough independent world opinion to strengthen its hand in negotiation with russia
8572830 we need some strategy rather than more foreign policy spin
8572831 for his own good he should step down now because then the transition will be very smooth but if you wait until the party polls you dont know what the people are going to say
8572832 there may be rude remarks they may say why dont you go you know all the kinds of nasty accusations finger pointing
8572833 if he waits until the elections it will cause a major split within the party because those who support him and those who oppose him will clash at the assembly
8572834 there have been demands it does not matter that they want to express themselves on the matter of stepping down
8572835 i am not one who is going to retain the leadership forever
8572836 the period of transition and so on were not mentioned in detail matters such as when the transition will take place and so on will be discussed between him and najib
8572837 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab
8572838 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8572839 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8572840 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8572841 er mellem mig og f tterfyren vil ikke have flere blandet ind i det
8572842 sie sieht zwar ums gesicht herum aus wie eine ziemlich alte englische bulldogge ist aber geistig nichts anderes als bush sein fiepsender und greinender yorkshire terrier der zwischen bushs beinen hindurch den russen ankeift
8572843 malaysia hopes that both parties will strengthen their belief that peace can only be obtained through negotiations
8572844 continued violence would only cause hardship and shall not resolve the key problems or issues in question
8572845 we have been forced to increase fares and cut capacity to eliminate poor performing routes
8572846 our results have been significantly impacted by the high fuel prices
8572847 poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make informed choices
8572848 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8572849 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8572850 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8572851 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8572852 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8572853 the flame will symbolize over the next 10 days the unique sporting spirit displayed by paralympic athletes
8572854 i think so many opportunities and warnings have been given which are not heeded
8572855 this just goes to show that they are afraid they think they can control what the people read
8572856 the operation has been extremely expensive so we will have to balance the domestic pressures on the one hand and pressures in somalia on the other and try to come up with a balanced solution
8572857 we didnt anticipate that the international community would be happy riding the ethiopian horse and flogging it at the same time for so long
8572858 over fifty people have died in the worst hit districts of supaul madhepura araria and saharsa since tuesday evening as the death toll during the monsoons in the state nears 100
8572859 thousands of people and children are struggling to survive they are on the top of roofs without any food or potable water
8572860 government helicopters and boats are just not reaching them in time to evacuate the people
8572861 i myself would not anticipate sanctions being imposed while the meeting has not yet taken place
8572862 this is an extremely important time for kosovo and a historical moment since we are assuming our responsibilities as an independent state
8572863 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8572864 n r nogle regioner og deres form nd sidder tungt p den regionale dagsorden kan det let betyde at det ogs er dem der former den offentlige mening og til dels de politiske l sninger omvendt kan det for de mere usynlige regioner betyde at deres indflydelse bliver mindre
8572865 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8572866 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility
8572867 the uttar pradesh batsman said the young brigade under dhoni wanted to do well in sri lanka after the asia cup disappointment
8572868 since we lost the final of asia cup in pakistan we were very keen to do well in sri lanka
8572869 det er godt at den nu er ude af billedet det statsministeren siger er tydeligt christiansborg sprog for at der ikke skal pilles ved det omr de

8572878 ik wist echt niet wat er gebeurde en schaamde me enorm gelukkig hadden de winkelbedienden snel door dat ik onschuldig was zelf had ik toen niet door dat dit pas het begin van de ellende betekende
8572879 uiteraard ga je dan zoeken naar een verklaring ik kwam al snel uit bij mijn pacemaker mijn cardioloog verzekerde me echter dat die de oorzaak niet kon zijn
8572880 ik ben gaan winkelen zonder bankkaart deed mijn broeksriem en uurwerk uit niets help
8572881 zo kun je het wel noemen ik ga nu winkelen om betrapt te worden leuk is dat niet ik wil gewoon weten waar de oorzaak ligt zodat we er iets kunnen aan doen

8572912 her surprise was understandable mughal sarai even though its name gives off a whiff of history was unlikely to interest anyone unless you have routinely passed its railway station during childhood a time when you are reading about the mughal emperors and when names of places inspire larger than life images but banaras barely ten kilometers away is a different planet technically i was standing by a colourless river in a small town in uttar pradesh watching people go about their business but the moment you identify the river and the town the earth under your feet becomes worthy of worship unlike other places whose history is measured in years banaras has defied time its history is as enchanting as and entwined with that of the gods if only history had provided mankind with a tv screen and a rewind button to watch what was going on at exactly the same spot you stood on on a certain date you clicked on i pretty much doubt if banaras would look any different if i were to scan footages through the centuries but i would certainly have kept pressing the pause button to look out for certain characters goswami tulsidas who wrote the ramayana for the layman or trailanga swami the pot bellied naked saint who is said to have lived for three hundred years most of which he spent in meditation either by floating in the river or sitting by its banks or allan ginsberg the beat poet who roamed the ghats in search of god it is a different matter that i wouldnt have recognised any of them the only person i would recognise in banaras was ram ratan and he was now waiting impatiently as ever for me

8573014 prosecutors play a very significant role in combating e crime and their advice at an early stage of police investigation can be fundamental to success
8573015 we are delighted to kick start this initiative because the network will enable prosecutors worldwide to join together to fight e crime

8573028 because were a creative organization people tend to assume that much of what we do cant be measured or analyzed thats wrong most of our processes involve activities and deliverables that can be quantified we keep track of the rates at which things happen how often something has to be reworked whether a piece of work was completely finished or not when it was sent to another department and so on data can show things in a neutral way which can stimulate discussion and challenge assumptions arising from personal impressions

8573031 if those whites at princeton really saw michelle as one who always would be black first it seems that she gave them that impression
8573032 by actually working with the black lower class or within their communities as a result of their ideologies a separationist may better understand the desperation of their situation and feel more hopeless about a resolution as opposed to an integrationist who is ignorant to their plight
8573033 there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community
8573034 predominately white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments
8573035 i hoped that these findings would help me conclude that despite the high degree of identification with whites as a result of the educational and occupational path that black princeton alumni follow the alumni would still maintain a certain level of identification with the black community however these findings do not support this possibility

8573062 the sco states welcome the adoption in moscow on august 12 of six principles of settling the conflict in south ossetia and support russias active role in contributing to peace and cooperation in the region
8573063 we are thankful for your understanding and an objective assessment of russias peacemaking efforts
8573064 we are sure that the position of sco members will get an appropriate international response i hope it will serve as a serious signal for those who try to justify the bloody adventure of the georgian leadership
8573065 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8573066 reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation

8573146 we have studied this in mice but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes
8573147 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress

8573152 de arbeidsmarkt is nog niet onder de indruk van de verzwakking van de conjunctuur
8573153 we moeten beter kunnen zeker omdat wij in vlaanderen en in ons land een economisch en maatschappelijk weefsel hebben dat nog veel te afhankelijk is van de traditionele energiebronnen zoals olie we moeten dus meer inspanningen leveren om van dit ondermaats presteren weg te geraken
8573154 op vlaams vlak worden daarvoor recent al nieuwe inspanningen geleverd denken we daarbij aan de verhoging van de ecologiepremie van 45 miljoen euro naar 120 miljoen euro aan bedrijven die op een ecologische wijze investeren
8573155 sterke bedrijven in clean tech leveren ten slotte een positieve bijdrage tot de handelsbalans en zorgen voor heel wat hoogwaardige groene jobs in het capricorn clean tech fonds werd een participatie genomen voor 15 miljoen euro en voor het innovatief aanbesteden is 10 miljoen euro uitgetrokken
8573156 volgens mij hebben we elkaar nooit goed geraakt gekrabd dat ga ik niet ontkennen
8573157 wist ik veel ik had haar al tien vijftien jaar niet meer gesproken
8573158 als je 18 jaar bent en je hebt heel verschillende karakters dan is dat heftiger dan wanneer je elkaar tien of vijftien jaar later tegenkomt
8573159 het gaf me een beetje rust en ik kon ontdekken wie ik eigenlijk was en dat bleek niet te zijn hoe de pers mij afschilderde

8573171 in cases that involve health professionals there are even more stringent regulations in relation to protecting the privacy of students in their care
8573172 where a student is deemed at serious risk or there is imminent threat to the students health and safety the student can be referred to a general practitioner
8573173 she didnt even know how to use the pills properly
8573174 just what exactly am i entitled to know my daughter needs real education on relationships and sex and she is not mature enough to make that decision alone
8573175 all these privacy regulations do is break down the relationships between parents and their children
8573176 these issues are very uncommon in our school considering we have more than 1200 students the problems that underlie these student health issues are very complex and generally family related
8573177 we need to look at why kids feel they cannot talk about this with their parents
8573178 if she had and the parents refused to give her the pill its not necessarily going to stop her having sex
8573179 i worry more about the kids at this age who are having sex and not seeking contraception
8573180 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8573181 a few years ago it was difficult and because of the music we were playing we were finding it difficult to get any kind of following if you put a guitar solo in a song you were knackered basically
8573182 it was as if the people who liked that kind of music were long gone but weve tried to put a new twist on the rock genre
8573183 theyre all making a comeback and people are more aware of rock again so it seems normal again
8573184 but now this genre of music is becoming identifiable for a new generation and a lot of those big rock groups are still active
8573185 creativity spawns from fun and feeling good having it feel good to play together
8573186 its great to be part of something where were all so committed
8573187 at this stage it is being treated as an industrial accident it occurred during unloading of a lorry on the construction site the investigation is ongoing which we are carrying out alongside the police
8573188 this is obviously a terrible accident and our thoughts are with the family of the man involved
8573189 we are co operating fully with the health and safety executive to establish exactly what happened
8573190 i was full of pride when i saw his picture but not happy that he has lost too much weight it was kind of strange because i havent seen him in so long
8573191 i was working in the t mobile shop in inverness and he was in inverness doing recruitment for 4 scots he came into the shop and it went from there it was love at first sight
8573192 it was horrible we had christmas dinner with some friends but the first christmas without your family is not very nice
8573193 the day he left was the worst day of my life i didnt know when i was going to see him again
8573194 it was also frightening as we didnt know what he was going out to the last time he was there two or three years ago he had been fighting all the time and his mum told me hed had a bad time when he got home because of what he had seen people dying for example
8573195 really we have been married near a year but we not been together for that year it feels as though we have been married for three and a half months
8573196 our son will be born in november and there is no guarantee my husband will be there to witness the birth of our first born
8573197 they were there for two months without doing any of the work they had been training for months for
8573198 i dont know if it was down to bad organisation but they were so bored and it felt as though they were sent out there for nothing and had been taken away from their families for nothing
8573199 we have been unable to increase income to match expenditure sufficiently to alter the situation and are now subject to the increases in fuel and supply costs created by the current international credit situation this however is a situation which cannot continue
8573200 the members were 100 per cent behind our refinancing proposals
8573201 i am very confident the club can move forward on to a sound financial footing and achieve the developments we want for the citizens and youth of inverness

8573203 der r ckgang der arbeitslosigkeit in bayern hat im august wie blich saison und ferienbedingt eine kurze verschnaufpause eingelegt

8573205 only about one fourth of all medical schools in the us require medical students to take even one nutrition course less than half of medical programs even provide an elective nutrition course students in such classes receive less than twenty total hours of nutrition education an amount they themselves consider inadequate
8573206 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
8573207 if you dont have anything good to say dont say anything at all
8573208 health wise if he were eating like this long term hed probably be having to see a cardiologist regularly
8573209 you have a place to go home to i dont michael cooper didnt either
8573210 in my understanding of faith every human being has the right to food shelter clothing and medical care and we have to find a way in our community and nation to remedy that
8573211 you have to be conscious of the fact that the folks we deal with arent peoples most favorite folks
8573212 you know its the panhandlers and stuff and during economic crunch time people will say why spend money on those things
8573213 what our new residents are looking for is not just pretty buildings and condominiums but also social responsibility
8573214 because at the end of the day what we do for the least among us reflects on how we all will be treated
8573215 and that is a powerful exercise for a growing city
8573216 he had problems but he died in the street and he could have been someones father son uncle you name it who is he leaving behind

8573218 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8573219 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them then they even shoved a fork into a victims stomach wild

8573225 there are so many different pieces to this store that invite you to enjoy the lifestyle enjoy the tea and incredible organic food wellness services and experience the new products
8573226 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8573227 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance

8573231 wasim was a very clever bowler he was lethal and very good at outsmarting the batsmen waqar was entirely different he bowled fast and used the yorker to good effect
8573232 murali has been an absolute champion and never loses his passion for the game soon he will go past wasims record as the highest wicket taker in one dayers and it will be difficult to surpass him
8573233 there were a lot of guys who were more talented than me my game was limited but i worked harder you have got to make the most of your talent and nothing comes easy
8573234 i have enjoyed my cricket thoroughly no regrets whatsoever there have been a few good performances along the way but for me winning the 1996 world cup remains the greatest achievement
8573235 week 1 entry 5 to help the students keep track of how many theyve done each week
8573236 student 7 etc that i edit in before they are published
8573237 i think its inevitable twenty20 will be an olympic sport
8573238 the international olympic committee could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics just think about the audiences in the subcontinent
8573239 you think about the audiences in the subcontinent 22 or 23 of the worlds population is based in that area
8573240 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 is how do we make it work
8573241 we definitely need a carve out period im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be this next generations opinions might change
8573242 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8573243 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game
8573244 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8573245 there was a fracture in my right hand ring finger which i sustained while taking a caught and bowled chance
8573246 i have had the surgery to set it right hopefully i should be bowling again after six weeks
8573247 already pakistan is not playing a test series this year and we are short of cricket

8573250 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8573251 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8573252 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8573253 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8573254 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8573255 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8573256 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8573257 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8573258 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8573259 it took a little while but some memory from his pup hood eventually seemed to surface and he came for a closer inspection
8573260 once hed had a sniff and then slid over the top of it for the first time he found he actually likes it
8573261 his innocence was proved by the police but yet he was dismissed from his job further his landlord asked him to vacate the house in a day or two
8573262 these groups have decided to organise a rally against the victimisation of muslims on thursday the forum has unanimously decided to support the rally
8573263 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8573264 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him he was saying just do it just do it
8573265 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8573266 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8573267 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it

8573324 i went downstairs and opened the living room door and was confronted by the living room on fire
8573325 i closed the door and shouted upstairs to the rest of the family to get out
8573326 i didnt realise they were trying to leave upstairs but they were restrained by the flames at the top of the window they came downstairs and got out the front door
8573327 i was using a cushion i couldnt put the fire out so i crawled through to the kitchen soaked a towel and came back and managed to put out the flames
8573328 after everything had calmed down and we were all outside safely we realised there had been a petrol bomb put through the window the living room window was smashed
8573329 after i had been released from the paramedics my son showed me the camera evidence he had it showed the incident taking place where the petrol bomb was lit and the person running along the road stopping and throwing it at the house
8573330 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
8573331 thatchers economics had at their core the belief that mass unemployment was not just a price worth paying but necessary in a modern economy
8573332 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of thatcher and i think here her social message epitomised in the unfair poll tax and her comments of no such thing as society cut against a very scottish grain of social conscience
8573333 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her lack of concern for social consequences even less
8573334 it wasnt a slip its what he believes he was sitting having a cosy chat with a rising star of the tory party who isnt a real journalist he must have felt very comfortable and he just came out with it
8573335 the snp has managed to convince a large section of scots that they are more left wing than labour
8573336 but being relaxed about thatchers economic policies does let the cat out of the bag and its consistent with their pro business low tax stance
8573337 the snp wants irish levels of taxation and scandinavian levels of public services but there is a contradiction there and they cant quite make up their minds
8573338 whereas at uk level labour talked right to act left because its centre right aspirational voters who decide elections in scotland which is traditionally left of centre the snp talks left to act right
8573339 that was a bigger sea change than many people realised at the time the tories were no longer the bogeymen we could do deals with them
8573340 the party has not tied up its economic and social justice arguments there are a lot of short term fixes going on we need to do a bit more thinking

8573376 hurricane katrina was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states
8573377 it formed over the bahamas on august 23 2005 and crossed southern florida as a moderate category 1 hurricane causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the gulf of mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea the storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a category 3 storm on the morning of august 29 in southeast louisiana and at the louisiana mississippi state line respectively
8573378 okay let me tell you what my concerns are number one you know the mayor has ordered the superdome to be used as a shelter of first resort i didnt hear about any other shelters as you may or may not know the superdome is about 12 feet below sea level so i dont know what the heck
8573379 im concerned about the roof i dont know whether the roof was designed to withstand a cat 5 hurricane
8573380 i do believe that i also heard there was no mandatory evacuations
8573381 taking prisoners out of prison they are leaving hotels open in downtown new orleans im very concerned about that
8573382 my gut tells me i told you guys my gut was that this is a bad one and big one i still feel that way today
8573383 look you cant do that because we in the field know what we need and what the priorities are snow all right brown and those priorities are established by the state and locals theyre not established by you
8573384 mike i know its tough but id like you to come back and fix it
8573385 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words
8573386 the language center of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8573387 this is consistent with our finding with newborn babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8573388 people should pick chocolate the same way they buy wine and food by flavor
8573389 eventually i started fashioning my own equipment and began churning out some fine quality chocolate
8573390 it is extremely hard work and takes a lot of time but boy is it beautiful when you get right
8573391 chocolate is an affordable indulgence no matter how difficult economic times get well always want to treat ourselves
8573392 now you can go to kansas city and find a good chocolate maker who rivals the quality and craftsmanship of that you would find in europe
8573393 people love chocolate especially in hard times when they want to be comforted
8573394 for right now im very happy just making chocolate that fills my factory

8573398 how do you deal with the negative comments about your articles they are brutal i dont think i could handle them
8573399 it wasnt always this simple and took me some time before overcoming this natural urgency to protect myself and attack back
8573400 holding a grudge against someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die
8573401 sometimes we respond with the intention of defending the side we took a position on
8573402 be around the change you want to see in the world
8573403 answering these questions often adds perspectives to the situation and youll realize that nothing good will come out of reacting your energy will be wasted and your inner space disturbed
8573404 of course i was hired for my looks and yes that was a loooong time ago
8573405 that was extremely rude you dont treat people like that
8573406 we need to get more than 1 000 people playing to set the record and i am confident we will make that we have got people playing the game on boards but others are playing online via their mobile phones and a games console
8573407 i love the new version the different countries are interesting and add a new element to the game the new banking system takes a bit of time to get used to but it is a lot quicker and more efficient plus it means you cant cheat any more
8573408 parents say they treat their children equally but when you ask people they say of course there was a favourite they take it for granted
8573409 people say mum always liked her best because she looked like her or shared her interests
8573410 the family is the primary social unit and if you feel you are not accepted or loved by your parents where does that leave you in this tough world
8573411 the big difference is that the new system has a lot more memory so what happened yesterday could never happen again

8573413 for andy isaksen computer scientist for the federal aviation administration in atlanta having servers that are up 24 7 is imperative
8573414 isaksen uses two philips ds714 mainframe computers as his message switching network
8573415 isaksen will install two stratus ftservers in his production network one in atlanta and the other in salt lake city two other identical servers are part of a test bed for running applications isaksen and his staff write
8573416 if one server dies the other one almost instantly takes over so there is no loss of service to the aviation community
8573417 isaksen will be deploying the stratus servers to the field in the middle of next month but doesn

8573420 i dont know if she was yelling a little bit or not
8573421 we know that the councilwoman is very passionate and shes not a pushover that we can say and when youre in that kind of situation that many people around shuffled from one room to another and someone comes up thats out of the loop and says youre going to be out of here i would imagine that you would be a little upset
8573422 about the lhc he acknowledged that it is unlikely to have anything to say about string theory
8573423 we will realize that this was an obvious prediction of string theory
8573424 at the end an argument between veltman and others broke out over the selling of particle physics using astrophysics
8573425 whoever wrote this article needs to take a physics class and then needs to be shot in the face

8573427 the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8573428 will 2008 also break the standing record low set in 2007 we will know in the next several weeks when the melt season comes to a close
8573429 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8573430 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8573431 its limited at best at this point because the charging officer has not had a chance to finalize the report

8573465 the preliminary assessment by pat was that we were ok but thats not good enough for me
8573466 the only way is to have an unbiased group look at this
8573467 the budget review committee will be supplemented with an accountant and financial analyst
8573468 theyll calculate the last 10 years of expenses from the parking lots and also project out the next 10 years to see what all the expenses are

8573470 sharon has led the charge in many cases and asked that the reliability continue to be considered and what cost it will have on the consumer

8573473 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16pct less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8573474 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8573475 thats very high because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8573476 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8573481 it was my wish in the first instance while on this tour to have devoted my attention exclusively to the public and national objects which i had in view but finding this arrangement did not comport with the feelings of my fellow citizens i relinquished it

8573483 the tour of james monroe president of the united states
8573484 here the president was also met by the committee of arrangements from the towns of alfred and sanford
8573485 i have knocked on 600 doors in town so far
8573486 my goal is to hit between 1 500 and 2 000
8573487 the second year was a whole different feeling you quickly realize that people are gearing up to run again so the desire to work together isnt as great people were paying more attention to how a vote will look
8573488 going through tax reform was a tough thing to do
8573489 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
8573490 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
8573491 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
8573492 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term
8573493 i feel my 14th amendment rights of due process are denied if the supreme judicial courts ruling on how signatures are to be gathered is accepted and allowed to be applied retroactively
8573494 the standard the court used and said should be applied was not known to anyone when the signatures were gathered
8573495 i have a sword but i have chosen not to use it

8573499 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8573500 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8573501 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8573502 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8573503 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8573504 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8573505 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8573506 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8573507 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8573508 we have not forgotten our commitments to you nor shall we do so

8573540 i got a letter from the commissioner aug 11 strongly encouraging us to consider forming a regional school unit rsu or an alternative organizational structure aos with kittery
8573541 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
8573542 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
8573543 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
8573544 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas
8573545 look at the administrative staff could you share a business office were not really talking about teaching staff but administrative functions payroll is a great example
8573546 they started to get together immediately as a result they had a plan that got approved in june they created a system theyre proud of
8573547 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8573548 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8573549 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8573550 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8573551 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has

8573583 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8573584 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8573585 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8573586 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8573587 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8573588 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8573589 since we pay no rent and have no paid staff nearly all of the funds go directly to our cost of food or fuel
8573590 the nearly 2 600 from kennebunk savings banks community ballot can buy us over 17 000 pounds of food from the good shepherd food bank in lewiston that alone can feed our families for up to two months
8573591 weve developed a system that is unique among food distribution pantries because the kennebunks and arundel are unusually proud communities we dont know who the recipients are we receive a request from the social service office in one of the three communities or occasionally a church pastor that someone needs food were told how many adults children and teenagers are in the household our volunteers package up a generous three day supply of food and deliver it to the social service office in the appropriate town someone associated with the family picks it up or the social service officer sees that it is delivered in all of my years working with this pantry i would not be able to name one person whom weve assisted
8573592 we are concerned that this year even though weve pre paid some oil we will not be able to help as many families though the need will be even greater
8573593 the high cost of heating oil exceeds our anticipated budget for assistance
8573594 we try to work through the school nurses and social workers if they know of a child in need they will contact us it could be as simple as a child needing eyeglasses or it could be a child in need of daycare during school vacations or a handicapped child in need of a special camp really its all about helping others
8573595 with the triathlon including relay teams and the duathlon we had 451 participate out of the total registration of 500

8573604 we dont do double sessions the first week because kids are working and we dont want to hurt the local businesses and we ask a lot of them that second week when were away
8573605 but the most important thing we accomplish is the team building
8573606 we do many team building activities and this year we will keep a journal of some things we do we talk a lot about becoming a brotherhood of football players and why we love football and our teammates and coaches
8573607 the kids swim together there are basketball courts and softball fields its hard work but the kids also have a lot of fun
8573608 we purposely make cabins eight to a cabin and we break them up by putting a couple of freshmen a couple sophomores a couple of juniors and a couple of seniors in each one we force the kids to get to know each other
8573609 a freshman comes out with a pretty decent friend who is a senior
8573610 the next week when he starts school he might be a little nervous but now he has a friend in the upper class the kids support one another
8573611 you may think someone is this or he may be that
8573612 it helps break down barriers and it may be corny to say but through this you become one unit its a great experience
8573613 we have reveille at 5 15 every morning for conditioning
8573614 we will talk a lot about commitment to the team and school this year and what it means to give your word about the school policy of drinking and such

8573616 he has been a big help during the transition hes been on call for us 24 hours a day hes done anything he can do for us joe is a great guy who will be missed
8573617 one of the things that excited me is that our principal jim daly is a former wrestling coach and the superintendent ed mcdonough is a former football coach at wells
8573618 for our administration to know first hand how an athletic department functions is great
8573619 my sons team was up here three years ago to play the wells pop warner team
8573620 i was really impressed with that group and a few years prior to that i was up here with some friends so i had been to wells before
8573621 everything was organized with a list of things that needed to be done before the start of school i couldnt have walked into a better situation
8573622 its alright come with me ill take care of you
8573623 hes already gone come with me ill take care of you
8573624 most of us have far more courage than we ever dreamed we possessed

8573627 this was a dream from the beginning of when we opened the museum
8573628 we formed a dory committee and hired boat builder bob eger who has a shop in south berwick we had a lot of volunteers that went there to help him build it
8573629 the volunteers are getting the inside ready and then will flip it and do the exterior
8573630 it will be deep green on the bottom with two yellow stripes on top those were the traditional colors
8573631 he had his shop in the place behind where the camera shop on shore road is
8573632 he launched the boats at the end of wharf lane there were a lot of wharfs there originally
8573633 she designed it from pictures there was no plan of a dory anywhere but plenty of pictures
8573634 in place of the portland ballet we have a doubleheader related to ragtime music and scott joplin
8573635 scott joplin wrote one opera in his lifetime treemonisha we were able to get a copy of the only recorded performance of it and are showing it on sept 5 7 p m dunaway center the next day masanobu ikemiya is returning to perform his program is part classical and part ragtime hes a first rate classical pianist when he came to the united states and heard ragtime he was overwhelmed by it
8573636 there will be 300 kites and art supplies to decorate them at the beach parking lot well have professional kites as well as the ones kids make and many prizes there will be a major lift off
8573637 theres the kite festival and masanobus concert and the barn gallery has its reception for the opening of the fall exhibition the barn gallery is always a very important part of capriccio
8573638 i think it would be great for my tenants and it would ease traffic flow and hang ups on route 1
8573639 we are currently in discussions with the pet store owner to resolve any potential conflict
8573640 i wanted to construct a building and parking area that was aesthetically pleasing that would fit in with the atmosphere here and wasnt an eyesore to the community
8573641 one day everything will be well that is our hope everything is fine today that is our illusion
8573642 i got started at age 40 when a friend asked if i wanted to do a team triathlon
8573643 i asked her what is it what do you do she told me it was a swim bike run event so i said i would do the swim because im pretty good in the water
8573644 i said im doing this by myself next year from there it has grown into a real joy
8573645 this one in the netherlands is the longest one ive ever done
8573646 when i first started doing sprints i never imagined doing a half ironman or an ironman its a matter of putting some time in and taking the next logical step
8573647 to get ready for the world championships i started doing longer bikes and spent longer times at each discipline so instead of a half hour i trained an hour but i put very little time in compared to others
8573648 im blessed with good genetics im extremely fortunate typically i train nine to 10 hours a week but it varies
8573649 those people who have the struggle to finish earn as much if not more respect than anyone
8573650 we stand out there and marvel at the pros and the elite athletes and say how amazing but you have the same emotion for those at the end for the people who have to dig so deep to finish theyre amazing look at what theyre doing they had every reason to not finish but they keep going
8573651 the last person is welcomed encouraged and respected as much as the winners and i love that
8573652 i tell them and write them down when i feel inspired and feel like i have something to say
8573653 the audience at the river club stood up after i told my stories its been a pretty amazing journey ever since then
8573654 a lot of people have said this is wonderful because of its historical context
8573655 having an event like this is a way to get people in the community to meet people that are writing about the area
8573656 it gives people more awareness about what we do here
8573657 wonderful mixture of artists and writers from over the years

8573665 yes oscar is the bigger fighter but manny pacquaio is a southpaw hes got great speed this is no easy fight for oscar
8573666 we can cherrypick we can do the commentary and a little bit of investigative journalism and that kind of thing but i cant see a business model for independent journalism funding hundreds of journalists to do the bigger things that you have to do to fulfil the democratic mission
8573667 not to maintaining quality journalism and its place as the fourth estate
8573668 we can cherrypick we can do the commentary and a little bit of investigative journalism and that kind of thing but i cant see a business model for independent journalism funding hundreds of journalists to do the bigger things that you have to do to fulfil the democratic mission
8573669 not to maintaining quality journalism and its place as the fourth estate
8573670 why something as poorly designed as the web became the next big thing and what that means for the future
8573671 i want musharraf to be tried and sent to the gallows
8573672 i want to see with my own eyes musharrafs wife and mother cry for him when the noose tightens around his neck
8573673 my iddat waiting period of four months and ten days that islam has imposed upon a woman who has been divorced or widowed after which a new marriage is permissible was a trying time when i and my three children did not have even have a roof over our heads for as long as i live my heart will continue to bleed and my anger will not abate
8573674 military bases to the united states without approval of the parliament
8573675 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
8573676 a trial under article 6 read with the high treason punishment act 1973 requires that the complainant must be the federal government will the brass of this country permit the government to be the complainant
8573677 of course any wrong doer should be tried in court
8573678 if he musharraf is to be tried so should asif ali zardari ppp co chairperson nominated for presidency rehman malik interior minister and a close crony of zardaris altaf hussain chief of muttahida qaumi movement and a long string of their lackeys mostly criminal said sadeque
8573679 unless that happens justice will remain a tool of the privileged and a commodity of patronage and this elected and democratic government will just be a continuation of the same old farce
8573680 if the pandoras box is never opened there will never be any addressing of the issues that have haunted us for over half a century
8573681 this is a risk we have to take if we do nothing we shall have extra constitutional interventions again
8573682 no that is not necessary the trial under article 6 can take place in the trial court and not be placed before the superior courts
8573683 either by the current judiciary or by the old one
8573684 the media civil society and some politicians are emphasising too much on his musharrafs trial without realising the repercussions
8573685 everyone who is anyone has skeletons rattling in his closet be it nawaz sharif or asif zardari so what will we achieve by trying one individual
8573686 anyone who has had a hand in bringing us to such a pass should come down from their confrontational stances and help create a consensual path for the future
8573687 pure made its name as the company behind the success of dab which is now the major format for digital radio in uk and a fast growing number of other countries
8573688 ive lost two jobs because of this my bosses just didnt want to be associated with the publicity
8573689 gary mckinnon is neither a terrorist nor a terrorist sympathiser
8573690 his case could have been properly dealt with by our own prosecuting authorities instead we believe that the british government declined to prosecute him to enable the us government to make an example of him
8573691 american officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry the consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the european court to prevent his removal
8573692 i suppose it means im not a secretive sophisticated checking myself every step of the way type of hacker
8573693 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
8573694 the us is making a clear stand that anyone making any attempts to compromise its computers and data will face the consequences
8573695 i have never let my schooling interfere with my education

8573698 karena belum memasuki puncak kemarau diperkirakan luasan yang mengalami kekeringan ini masih akan terus bertambah
8573699 khusus untuk di kecamatan tempuran luasan 0 7 hektar yang kekeringan itu langsung mengalami gagal panen
8573700 pada awal musim kemarau kami sudah mengimbau agar petani menanam palawija saja namun dengan kondisi ketersediaan air yang sangat terbatas sebagian besar dari mereka ternyata tetap bersikukuh menanam padi
8573701 itu pun setiap kali mendapatkan jatah pasokan air yang diperoleh hanya cukup untuk mengaliri sekitar 4 000 hingga 5 000 meter persegi sawah saja
8573702 dalam revisi uu tersebut aborsi hanya dibatasi pada indikasi medis dan perkosaan tidak dalam perspektif kesehatan untuk melindungi perempuan atas hak reproduksinya
8573703 padahal pandangan tokoh agama kan berbeda dari sini saja sudah terlihat aturan ini tak mengakomodir hak perempuan atas reproduksi selama ini isu aborsi tak pernah dilihat dari aspek kesehatan tapi dari aspek hukum dan moral
8573704 aturan ini tak memakai pendekatan pelarangan tetapi pengaturan dan upaya pencegahan atas praktek aborsi yang tak aman
8573705 para que los atletas sean exitosos en el mundo deportivo del entretenimiento de hoy en d a tienen que poder ser competentes dentro y fuera de las canchas

8573707 lo que haremos es trabajar con ellas en las reas donde necesiten ayuda y brindarle los recursos necesarios como tutor as
8573708 en mi opini n esto es terrible pero no me sorprende porque los estadounidenses siempre buscan formas de evitar que vengan jugadores de otros pa ses a ganar en su propio territorio

8573735 you dont play the game to reach these milestones it was nice to hear the news after the match and to surpass olivier magne is a great achievement but there is still plenty of rugby ahead of me
8573736 we havent been thinking about the history of the wins we are more focused on our preparation and what we have to do this weekend we really need to be mentally and physically fresh for this game
8573737 it would be very special to win but not so much for the history its not something weve even spoken about we came over here with the focus to win two games and so from that point of view it would be very special we set our goals high and we want to achieve them
8573738 obviously the breakdown is an important part of the game and so we do take notice of it but we are also aware that the boks have some big players who can disrupt play in that area we will have to be on top of our game because they are very competent at the breakdown
8573739 its really disappointing to see the suspension he was given but we will just have to deal with that its a bit shocking for all of us but that ruling now sets a precedent for bringing players down in the lineout although i didnt even think that was such a bad one
8573740 it has been surprising to me because thats one of their big strengths but then the new rule about collapsing the maul may be playing on their minds
8573741 except for allen burns who as you probably know is so busy with the minneapolis project
8573742 no man hes not doing anything in minneapolis he is doing minneapolis
8573743 now wait a minute i know there was a minneapolis before that didnt the lakers basketball team start there
8573744 yeah thats where the name minneapolis got started it was some deal between the nba and hubert humphrey sr to avoid admitting that the state didnt have a single city with a population larger than 20 000 the mtm show people picked up on that and of course and hired allen burns to the writing staff because of his prior experience
8573745 when he wrote for the bullwinkle cartoons he invented the town of frostbite falls
8573746 the way i heard it there was some early disagreement with the governor or some other state officials over what to name it
8573747 i mean think about it do you really think a character like prince could have come from anywhere in the midwest
8573748 yeah that ones a stretch but what about garrison keillor
8573749 yep apparently just before the 1980 census the state house passed a law re allocating a percentage of the population in all the towns to go toward minneapolis trouble was a few of them lost enough numbers to fall off the map keillor picked one with a good name and the rest is media hype history
8573750 done in new york city from day one hes renting the ed sullivan theater from letterman on weekends
8573751 oh thats for real it kind of ended up getting built as a substitute for an urban infrastructure and its another great bit of misdirection i mean after youve been in that massive shopping complex for a few hours you usually just forget whether youve seen anything like a regular city
8573752 this is hollywood the place that makes things come true that really arent things like minneapolis where the reality is an open secret that you dont spread around and its certainly not the only one i probably shouldnt have told you this much but you look like youd understand you do understand dont you
8573753 hai jangan ngobrol sendiri dengarkan jangan berbicara sendiri dong coba sini ini masalah penting

8573772 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8573773 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8573774 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8573775 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8573776 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8573777 dont judge my game purely on my goals judge it on goals assists and how i help the team play thats the way my game is

8573788 in other areas we still rely on proprietary software if we have alternatives that prove themselves to be quite equivalent we give preference to open software model because that would allow for future developments that would allow for future betterment of the software
8573789 the idea is not to make a business out of that but more like a social franchise
8573790 its interesting this idea of providing a local solution for a local problem
8573791 we see based on third party researchers that 85 percent of the computers that are sold with open source are transformed to windows in the first 30 days and another 10 percent in next 30 days
8573792 linux we are seeing has some room in the market
8573793 its good that it has some room because it forces us to be better if we are inefficient in our distribution we need to improve that its really good to see a sort of new competitor in the marketplace
8573794 what we want policy to do is to create the conditions that empower people so that all people have the freedom to live flourishing lives
8573795 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8573796 what we want policy to do is to create the conditions that empower people so that all people have the freedom to live flourishing lives
8573797 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8573798 since my head will be down no one will see me rolling my eyes perfect
8573799 the fact is that the taliban now has pretty good insight into where were picking up information and how were developing it into actionable intelligence
8573800 the gruesome incident prompted hundreds of afghans in the affected area to take to the streets chanting anti america slogans
8573801 the taliban deliberately fed bogus intelligence to the united states
8573802 the united states and nato should get out and let the regional powers help afghanistan deal with its problems that means pakistan india russia and iran
8573803 the leaders of china kazakhstan kyrgyzstan russia tajikistan and uzbekistan were due to discuss regional economic and security ties along with afghan president hamid karzai and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad

8573809 the two leaders gave their directions to advance ties in the economy trade and energy fields as well as military cooperation
8573810 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership

8573812 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8573813 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8573814 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8573815 surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8573816 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8573817 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression
8573818 i dont think actually that georgiana died in a carriage crash
8573819 vi er overbeviste om at alle studerende uanset fagligt tilh rsforhold og karriere nsker kan f gavn af en entrepreneurship uddannelse det er gl deligt at s mange forskellige studieretninger har besluttet sig for at udvikle nye kurser inden for entrepreneruship
8573820 vi har gjort og g r meget for at f el forbruget p dagsordenen hos de offentlige indk bere staten og kommunerne er jo forpligtet til at k be energi effektive produkter og vi regner med at regionerne ogs snart bliver indbefattet af reglerne
8573821 pemerintah aceh akan menyurati kepala negara dengan harapan presiden susilo bambang yudhoyono dapat melakukan pendekatan agar warga perantau itu tetap bisa menetap di malaysia
8573822 kita akan mendiskusikan lagi atas isu pemulangan warga perantau di malaysia itu
8573823 masalah tersebut merupakan hubungan antar negara jadi aceh yang merupakan bagian dari negara kesatuan republik indonesia nkri maka pemerintah aceh tidak bisa membicarakan langsung dengan pemerintah malaysia
8573824 kita menghendaki agar mereka tidak segera dipulangkan karena pemerintah aceh sedang mempersiapkan berbagai langkah misalnya terkait dengan lapangan pekerjaan untuk menampung jika warga perantau kembali ke daerah
8573825 even with the michael jackson task whenever hed do something you guys would go thats amazing
8573826 thats not helping dude people with disabilities they wanna be able to do it to the best of their ability they dont wanna be told that things are amazing were all on tv and we dont wanna look like s
8573827 just shut up and dont say anything its the best way
8573828 but then its like hes always saying oh its on camera its on camera yeah exactly its on camera what nice people we are nice caring people there should be more like that in the world might be a better place
8573829 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8573830 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8573831 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8573832 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8573833 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
8573834 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
8573835 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
8573836 some participants will be seen once in clinic and undergo testing with an echocardiogram while participating in this study
8573837 the individuals who have already undergone a clinical pulmonary hypertension evaluation may be able to participate through a review of select medical records and lung biopsy specimens
8573838 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8573839 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8573840 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8573841 we are enormously proud to see rose ann so prominently recognized year after year after year
8573842 its a tribute to her vision her principles and her values that have inspired us all and are a perfect match for the best in our organization and the model of patient advocacy that defines registered nurses and cna nnoc
8573843 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8573844 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8573845 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8573846 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
8573847 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
8573848 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
8573849 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8573850 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know
8573851 at the same time its becoming more and more challenging to find time for kids to have physical activity kids are overly scheduled parents have to work at finding avenues for activity
8573852 basically its when an athlete passes out or nearly passes out during or soon after exercise
8573853 there is something going on that prevents an athlete from sustaining an upright position
8573854 common yet still concerning reasons include things like minor dehydration muscle cramps and postural hypotension
8573855 more worrisome conditions include worsening heat illness hypoglycemia low sodium and heart related issues these can have major health implications including death
8573856 at this point we need to prevent people from going further into the spectrum of heat illness stretch drink water or sports drinks if a person is wearing any type of equipment take it off
8573857 after you call 911 immediately immerse the person in a tub of cold water and ice
8573858 dont wait to pull off equipment just plunge the person right in
8573859 by the time someone is thirsty they are already dehydrated
8573860 take frequent breaks and put water bottles in the shade and get out of the sun
8573861 in some counties coaches will schedule early morning and late evening practices to avoid practicing between the hot hours of 11 and three
8573862 if a person has been training indoors or in cooler weather i recommend a seven to 10 day acclimatization period before going into harder training outdoors in the heat
8573863 i remember being very dizzy and i couldnt stop vomiting
8573864 i had to wait in the hospital for my eye pressure to go down and for all the blood to drain out of my eye
8573865 unfortunately this is a common story when you mix sports and the lack of proper eye protection
8573866 while noah was a bystander in this instance 40 000 people suffer from eye injuries related to sports every year
8573867 hand and eye coordination is now very difficult for noah
8573868 she had the largest break in her eyeball that i had ever seen
8573869 she required multiple surgeries and we were happy and fortunate that we were able to save her eye
8573870 instead of being taken down by this very serious injury maura turned it into a drive to prevent it happening to others
8573871 this is an important way for parents to spare their children unnecessary injury and pain
8573872 i recommend safety goggles for all sporting activities even when it comes to children playing in their own homes
8573873 we even put on safety goggles when we play catch with a baseball in our own backyard
8573874 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8573875 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8573876 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
8573877 this study by dr mondal and colleagues has crucial implications in the persistence of sub endothelial hiv reservoirs and will be important to the development of future therapies
8573878 her work brings great credit to all those involved in the award and visually articulates at the highest level the problems of womens health in the developing world
8573879 having worked on the themes of womens sexuality birth and reproductive health through photography for the past twenty five years it is a great honour to have this work recognised by the royal colleges
8573880 it is the power of the image to tell a story and advocate for change that is the driving force behind the photographs i take one woman dies every minute somewhere in the world due to the complications of pregnancy and childbirth this is a tragedy and one that is preventable
8573881 if my photographs highlight the need to invest more in womens health especially in developing countries then i am using my creativity to the best of my ability
8573882 here in the west we live in an affluent society and sometimes the very thought of maternal suffering in other countries is abstract
8573883 in the uk there is a comprehensive pathway of care to support a woman during her pregnancy birth and in the postnatal period in some countries however women do not have access to the services which we take for granted
8573884 these photographs are poignant rousing emotions which words fail to convey they are beautiful and remind us of the symbolic imagery of mother and child which has a long tradition dating back to primitive times
8573885 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings amd results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health studies have also demonstrated that patients with visual impairment tend to have longer hospitalisations make greater use of health and community care services and are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8573886 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8573887 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8573888 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8573889 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8573890 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
8573891 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
8573892 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
8573893 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice
8573894 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8573895 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
8573896 the link between nonmelanoma skin cancer and increased risk for many different types of cancer may provide valuable clues to advance what we know about the causes of cancer
8573897 right now we do not understand why this link is present but it suggests that skin cancer may be a marker for a characteristic likely a genetic characteristic that increases overall susceptibility to cancer this certainly makes nmsc seem to be a more important part of ones personal health history than we previously thought
8573898 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
8573899 as an evolutionary biologist i feel it is my obligation as well as my personal desire to communicate with the public
8573900 demand a forceful and informed response from active scientists in the field of evolutionary biology
8573901 phase coherent spin precession and spin superfluidity of 3he b
8573902 the players really tried their best and i know they wanted to win it could have been better for us but for the fact that our strikers could not convert the chances that came their way
8573903 training is okay and although i am training with the first team the coach is not using me on several occasions ive wanted to leave the club but the officials insist that i stay on
8573904 i really dont know what the problem is they should tell me if i have a problem they should at least try me out and see where the problem is its like the officials want me but the coach doesnt want me
8573905 hes a player weve known about for a while and weve become aware he might be available hes a pacy winger which is something we havent got
8573906 he had a work out with the lads and looked very quick
8573907 its difficult to say how he would do in games because its different playing in the premier league than it is in russia
8573908 i havent got any offers as yet so i am now back home focusing my mind after the sad reality of what happened i felt hard done when i heard that i was no longer in gordon igesunds plans after having done so well last season
8573909 there is nothing that i can do about the decision which i respect i dont regret playing for maritzburg because there was never a time that i experienced anything bad if it were possible i would go back now because i dont have a problem with anyone there
8573910 being the person that i am i hold no hard feelings because i have been through worse things than this before in my career
8573911 life goes on and all i want is to just play football again because then i will continue to stay strong
8573912 nigeria can not excel in international sports competitions until government hearken to the cries of enyimba players who were never rewarded for winning the caf champions league 35 years after the nations debut through stationery stores
8573913 obasanjo deliberately refused to celebrate enyimba because i was involved even when the team retained the trophy in 2004 he denied them plots of land promised by the federal capital territory fct minister nasir el rufai their tears are yet to dry and you can see the effect on nigerian sports
8573914 that 2003 team was one nigeria from hausa land came yusuf mohammed and abu musa yoruba interest was represented by seyi ogunsanya and ajibade omolade ndigbo had players like obinna nwaneri and romanus orjinta the middle belt offered david tyavkase vincent enyeama stood in for niger delta the side even had ecowas brothers in joetex frimpong and muri ogounbiyi yet obasanjo failed to honour them compare that with the national awards given al ahli players by egyptian president hosni mubarak for equaling enyimbas giant strides
8573915 yes both okaka and esposito are players who interest siena a lot
8573916 i have daily contacts with prade bruno conti and luciano spalletti and we have a very good rapport
8573917 if we can make any deal it is with roma with whom we have very good rapport in fact
8573918 no doubt the board have done well because we now have companies like globacom lucozade sports and others trying to be part of the league but i want to ask one question
8573919 the npl chairman just announced that every club will get nine thousand cartons of lucozade sports drink this season but what happens if a club wants to go with red bull or power horse
8573920 the npl have already knocked off one category of sponsorship and are forcing the clubs to use it
8573921 i think this anomaly should be looked at because they are killing opportunities for clubs in terms of taking all the juicy offers
8573922 today the npl is still trying to get their television rights right but this is what the sponsors are looking for to get to those at home who do not come to the stadium
8573923 im looking forward to a brighter future to go and play for an important club maybe in the european champions league
8573924 i wanted to leave them last season they begged me they said that i should stay so that i will come back to serie a and then i can leave
8573925 have any of you had problems logging in to the site today
8573926 the national health service should cover the drug cost of lucentis ranibizumab for the first 14 injections in each eye being treated if people need more than 14 injections per eye the manufacturer of ranibizumab has agreed to take over the drug cost from the nhs
8573927 an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care
8573928 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8573929 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8573930 a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8573931 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8573932 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 primary care trusts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight the resulting stress and suffering has been cruel and unnecessary many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8573933 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8573934 a pragmatic and effective blueprint for reducing tens of thousands of deaths from premature heart disease
8573935 only a fraction of people with fh in the uk are identified and the majority of people will remain unaware of their condition and untreated often with tragic consequences at the moment we know that without treatment 50 of men with untreated fh will suffer a heart attack by the age of 50 and 30 of women with untreated fh will suffer a heart attack by the age of 60 once an individual is diagnosed with fh the condition can be managed usually with a statin to help them reach normal life expectancy
8573936 this guidance has recognised that some adults with fh need to be put onto a high intensity statin immediately particularly if their ldl c levels need to be reduced by more than half
8573937 nhs trusts across the country and indeed health systems across the globe will need to be linked and able to work together in order to reach all members of affected families
8573938 and we remain on track to launch in both the usa and europe in 2010
8573939 we are also pleased that we are making good progress with proposals for renegotiating the convertible bonds which we expect to announce shortly
8573940 we remain optimistic about the prospects for further growth of the business ahead of the launch of flutiform and beyond
8573941 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8573942 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8573943 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8573944 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8573945 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8573946 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8573947 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8573948 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8573949 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8573950 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8573951 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8573952 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8573953 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
8573954 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8573955 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8573956 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8573957 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8573958 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8573959 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8573960 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8573961 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8573962 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8573963 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8573964 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8573965 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8573966 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
8573967 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
8573968 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
8573969 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
8573970 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
8573971 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area

8573980 a wonderfully good looking movie with exciting passages and a captivating heroine in lyra

8573990 by ripping out the very things that made the novel so spell binding and original were left with an ultimately quite hollow shallow and self conscious movie which is more interested in showing off its admittedly breathtaking special effects than telling an interesting story

8573993 there has also been continued improvement in reducing the gross deficit predicted to be 45 million at year end down from 125 million at the end of 2007 08 and 1 312 million in 2005 06

8573995 the nhs is well on the way to delivering 18 weeks from referral to treatment and the progress on the mrsa target is a tremendous achievement that highlights how everyone working in the nhs has taken responsibility for making our hospitals cleaner and safer

8573997 these figures are really encouraging and show that the nhs is making the most of a much needed period of stability in order to improve its overall performance

8574017 those around successful leaders or the observers in this research do not have difficulty equating supportive leadership behaviour with decisive action to maintain standards above all they appear to admire the combination of the two
8574018 what is clear is that the most admired leaders are highly skilled in the modern areas of leadership but importantly they are also able to set tough standards and achieve results observers want leaders to combine ethical and inspirational behaviour with the ability to take tough business decisions
8574019 modern leadership can no longer be regarded as a soft option this research shows that it is integrity honesty and decisive action that marks out the truly successful leaders their followers have no problem equating ethics and discipline and neither should we leaders in all fields from business to sport to politics cannot escape the need to adapt to this new firm but fair style of leadership not if they want to remain at the top

8574030 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8574031 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8574081 armenia certainly can not choose between the two warring sides
8574082 nor can it be indifferent we should be able to find the right balance and i think that can be achieved through an upgraded complementarity
8574083 that means our foreign policy should be much more public
8574084 saying nothing when the situation is difficult might be a solution
8574085 what the authorities have done in connection with the latest developments is understandable i dont want to voice any criticism
8574086 i think that as soon as this problem arose we could have publicly told russia and the u s that what is happening does not stem from anybodys interests is bad for the region and in the global political sense
8574087 armenia would have had a clearer stance by telling everyone that armenia is not going to choose between its two allies indeed if russia is our strategic ally georgia is our natural ally
8574088 as i said our silence or low key stance on the other issue is understandable but i think that we could lag behind on the nagorno karabakh issue
8574089 if we fail to enter these processes and clearly express our position on karabakhs self determination im afraid we will find it harder to achieve results desirable to us
8574090 those countries have frequently said that the karabakh issue unites them and that they have no differences on that issue i am really concerned that those disagreements on georgia could also manifest themselves in their positions on the karabakh conflict
8574091 on the one hand it can not openly welcome russias move because it would spoil relations with georgia something which a blockaded armenia can not afford
8574092 on the other hand armenia can not condemn something done by the kremlin besides the nagorno karabakh conflict is similar to the conflicts in south ossetia and abkhazia so how can armenia not welcome the recognition of these unrecognized republics by any country of the world
8574093 lets face it are jungle islands probably less exciting as they were four years ago

8574095 i have been considering this for some time but felt it was important not to announce my departure before the festival so as to not impact on this years festival
8574096 following discussion with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect but i would like to stress that i will contribute fully to the independent review of the box office which was announced earlier this month
8574097 i would like to thank the board for their support over the last year and i would especially pay tribute to the fringe society staff team who deliver vital services that underpin the festival every year they work tirelessly and well above the call of duty and this year in particular they have dealt with very challenging circumstances with hard work patience and dedication
8574098 the board is very grateful to jon for his significant contribution to the fringe at a challenging time of great change and in the short time he has been in post he has dealt with an unprecedented range of challenges
8574099 we are pleased that jon is willing to assist with the independent review of the box office the board appreciate his future career aspirations and we would like to thank him for all his hard work and to wish him well in the future

8574155 they see where its grown with their own eyes and pick it with their own hands they dont need a sign in a store to tell them how fresh it is
8574156 wouldnt pay us what we needed to break even and make a little money
8574157 the you pick is the reason ive been able to do this for so long
8574158 most people who go out to pick fruits and vegetables use it as a recreational activity so youll get all kinds of customers on the weekend and no one on wednesday
8574159 its a cheap way to get exercise entertainment and food with little cost the trick is getting the customer to come out and pick versus when the crop is actually ready
8574160 the improvements they did are not worth anything if you dont put in a farmers market

8574162 virtual ap classes are a terrific opportunity for students in small missouri high schools although the first year participation in online ap classes was small i expect to see this number grow rapidly as schools become more familiar with the program

8574173 the district will really be able to increase educational opportunities for all students while addressing crowding in school related to growth
8574174 it is my understanding that every other public and private high school in johnson county includes freshman students at the high school level and that freshmen already are being educated at the high school in all but two districts in kansas
8574175 increased funding for bioscience through the 1 8 cent sales tax is a part of an intentional strategy to make the johnson county workforce more competitive and to give johnson county employees and students an opportunity to remain in johnson county
8574176 safety is the number one concern for every single parent
8574177 we know there are significant incidents happening in our schools on a regular basis that are frightening for parents families and students themselves
8574178 parents shouldnt be too shocked by these numbers because theyre just a better reflection of the truth
8574179 theyre moving to address this theyre moving in the right direction
8574180 we have said if a crime is committed if violence occurs we want that directly reported to the philadelphia police department to school police
8574181 some of those schools are still doing a good job for some kids
8574182 persistently dangerous is a hard label for a school to shed and its a diagnosis that has to lead to a treatment
8574183 i just saw history where hillary clinton released her delegates to obama everyone had tears in their eyes
8574184 basically anyone who was not able to secure a spot in a hotel within downtown denver is forced to take a lengthy trip into the city for events every morning and out of the city from events every evening
8574185 denver is essentially a driving city its sprawling nature is not conducive for an efficient public transportation system
8574186 introducing an environmentally safe cab company would have been both a distinguishing feat for the democratic national convention and a solid investment for the city
8574187 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8574188 i am mindful that only yesterday in birmingham ala our children crying out for brotherhood were answered with fire hoses snarling dogs and even death i am mindful that only yesterday in philadelphia miss young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered
8574189 given the virtual absence of substantive differences between the two democratic rivals its difficult to imagine these core supporters not voting for obama when push comes to shove if it turns out that more than a handful of them dont clinton style feminism will be exposed as an absurdity as opposed to something thats badly out of date
8574190 we first started seeing spouses playing a major role in party conventions in 1996 when elizabeth dole and hillary clinton gave speeches at their partys conventions
8574191 research on candidates spouses speeches since 1996 has found that 98 percent of their statements are positive they also focus more on character than policy with 73 percent of remarks about a persons character
8574192 candidate acceptance addresses have about 77 percent of positive statements whereas 23 percent of statements are attacks on the opposing party or its nominee
8574193 this compares to 40 percent of attacks from statements in tv spots and 35 percent of statements in debates from the general election contest

8574195 birds are so mobile and it is impossible to count them directly
8574196 instead we capture a relatively small sample of the entire population and band them then we compile reports of banded birds taken by hunters and analyze information about where and when they were taken the resulting statistics reveal a surprising amount of useful information

8574220 the nearly 2 600 from kennebunk savings banks community ballot can buy us over 17 000 pounds of food from the good shepherd food bank in lewiston that alone can feed our families for up to two months
8574221 weve developed a system that is unique among food distribution pantries because the kennebunks and arundel are unusually proud communities we dont know who the recipients are we receive a request from the social service office in one of the three communities or occasionally a church pastor that someone needs food were told how many adults children and teenagers are in the household our volunteers package up a generous three day supply of food and deliver it to the social service office in the appropriate town someone associated with the family picks it up or the social service officer sees that it is delivered in all of my years working with this pantry i would not be able to name one person whom weve assisted
8574222 we are concerned that this year even though weve pre paid some oil we will not be able to help as many families though the need will be even greater
8574223 the high cost of heating oil exceeds our anticipated budget for assistance
8574224 we try to work through the school nurses and social workers if they know of a child in need they will contact us it could be as simple as a child needing eyeglasses or it could be a child in need of daycare during school vacations or a handicapped child in need of a special camp really its all about helping others

8574258 this case clearly demonstrates the effective cooperation between dod investigative agencies and the shared dedication and fortitude our agents in the field have in pursuing these cases and bringing the guilty parties to justice
8574259 anyone who is contemplating putting themselves in a position where their selfishness and greed overtakes their honor and sense of duty to the nation and taxpayers they serve should beware we will continue to thoroughly and doggedly investigate these types of allegations and the findings will be turned over to the appropriate entity for prosecution
8574260 americas warfighters deserve the very best to perform their jobs and the taxpayers expect nothing less bribery and corruption within the military not only takes away precious dollars necessary for the dedicated american warfighter but it undermines the confidence of the american public who demand a military procurement system that spends their tax dollars wisely and responsibly this investigation should serve as a warning for those intent on defrauding the u s military and american public that the defense criminal investigative service dcis will pursue these crimes relentlessly

8574279 cemex no reconoci nuestra potestad para establecer nuestra propia industria en el pa s lo que para nosotros es inaceptable
8574280 cemex ha tenido una actitud completamente distinta algunas empresas transnacionales se han equivocado con lo que es nuestro pa s tenemos como experiencia las petroleras que algunas creen que est n por encima del poder del estado
8574281 lo que han hecho es extraer del pa s nuestros recursos vaciar nuestras minas de la materia prima para tener una estrategia y negocio global que no necesariamente tiene que ver con nuestra estrategia nacional
8574282 si los privados tienen inversiones eso hay que reconoc rselos es lo que establece nuestra ley cuando utiliza el t rmino de justiprecio para las expropiaciones eso es lo que llamamos un acuerdo razonable
8574283 tenemos que actuar ajustados a nuestras leyes y en lo que est vigente ahora en la ley de expropiaci n

8574286 i ride most every day and i race every weekend in either one or two races
8574287 it was the first time i ever had a road bike but i really fell in love with it i had a blast it was a release of energy and freedom

8574289 i had found something that i had fun with and i was good at
8574290 the start and finish is right in market square so its a long rectangle right through downtown
8574291 each lap takes only two to three minutes to do so its a good race for spectators its not more than every few minutes before you see us go by again
8574292 the whole pretense of the event is promoting a healthy lifestyle and getting families together
8574293 its a sporting event yes but we knew right away we couldnt close off the downtown streets without taking advantage of it and making this into a festival
8574294 if you started riding a road bike it will probably become sort of addictive
8574295 the best way to get into it is to go to a local shop and ask about rides in the area see what it is to go fast before you go to your first race

8574304 and sending it to earthtenders composting facility in farmington new hampshire where it will be made into organic compost
8574305 is that in these difficult times how can we not do whatever we can to conserve resources it used to be considered patriotic to conserve and recycle everything now were told were told were not patriotic if we dont consume
8574306 most customers are surprised we have so much that we can compost
8574307 some local offices are so keen on it they bring back their cups and put them in our compost bins
8574308 im from the seacoast area and when i came back
8574309 it became my passion to do it here in downtown portsmouth permaculture is like a tea bag flowing of every single ingredient together on a daily basis
8574310 when i was being certified we had to keep a daily journal
8574311 i had to write down how i got to work every thing i did in one day
8574312 it worked it made sense i began to see it was important to walk or bike to work to really think about every action i took even the tiniest change can make a difference
8574313 lots of people think they dont have the ability to engineer change
8574314 they can they can become empowered by just using compostable cups and so on all the little things really add up
8574315 for example our customers can bring their own mugs and get coffee for 1 we can do this because they bring their own mugs and no waste products are involved this sounds small but it really isnt small at all
8574316 i really hope to able to get other local business in on this project

8574393 si alguien tiene dudas sobre mi motivaci n que las tenga lo nico que yo puedo decir es que ahora mismo estoy m s motivado que nunca
8574394 esto a n no se ha acabado seguir luchando para conseguir los resultados que quiero todav a queda un tercio del campeonato y eso es suficiente para contraatacar
8574395 es el mejor de todos los circuitos y con un poco de suerte por fin seremos capaces de lograr que el coche funcione como yo quiero
8574396 esta victoria por ser primera tras operaci n es muy importante
8574397 puede ser mejor a o que ninguno imag nate con 25 a os y el giro el tour y la vuelta en mi palmar s
8574398 un triplete ser a algo m s hist rico que ganar una medalla ol mpica
8574399 ser a un sue o pasar a la historia por eso siempre he dicho que me gustar a ganar la vuelta si no este a o otro pero claro intentar que sea este

8574402 ich wusste es schon immer unter druck entstehen die besten ideen
8574403 los dos se quedaron alucinados en un d a en el que se pusieron en evidencia muchas cosas una el real madrid no tiene por qu hacer lo que quiere cuando quiera
8574404 dos no todos los futbolistas est n dispuestos a quedar mal con los clubes en los que m s han crecido profesionalmente ya que tanto villa como cazorla que tambi n renov ayer por el villarreal han demostrado ser agradecidos
8574405 yo cuando quiero fichar a alguien voy de cara y directo si se puede hacer bien en caso contrario a otra cosa
8574406 estuvimos muy cerca de hacerlo pero finalmente no puedo ser
8574407 entre el domingo y el lunes ya tuvo una primera certificaci n
8574408 y el martes nos dedicamos a pensar qu pod amos hacer para buscar una soluci n
8574409 ya dej claro que el villarreal no iba a negociar nada por cazorla
8574410 por suerte el futbolista estaba en nuestra sinton a y ha decidido quedarse aqu a pesar de que ya se daba por hecho incluso se hablaba de la presentaci n del jugador en madrid
8574411 nosotros respetamos todas las opiniones pero siempre que nos respeten a nosotros
8574412 cazorla se queda porque es uno de los nuestros es un buen chaval un gran futbolista y nos va dar mucho xitos y muchos triunfos es un futbolista clave en nuestro proyecto
8574413 adem s era muy duro y una l stima que este jugador abandonara el club a una semana del inicio del campeonato
8574414 ganar el tour o el giro es lo m ximo para un ciclista pero ser oro ol mpico en una especialidad como el ciclismo y en un deporte que en europa por ejemplo se sigue mucho es un reconocimiento social y mundial enorme que no te dan el giro y el tour
8574415 en los mundiales hay opciones de sacar oro con scar freire que va a ser el punta de lanza de la selecci n espa ola porque el recorrido se ajusta a sus caracter sticas y vamos a estar ayud ndole a expensas de las situaciones que haya en carrera
8574416 los ciclistas fijamos un objetivo a lo largo del a o y no hay ning n baremo ni una puntuaci n para decidir si ha sido mejor el ganador del giro o el del tour al rev s tenemos que estar orgullosos de que en nuestro pa s est n muchos de los mejores ciclistas del mundo el que es n mero uno es el ciclismo a nivel nacional

8574425 we want our kids to see those parts of the game
8574426 so we highlighted all the times appalachian state got screwed by the officials because they are trying to get michigan the bowl money or all the times michigan had a big play or other times they knocked the crap out of appy and they got back up
8574427 to beat a like cincinnati would be pretty comparable to what appalachian state did at michigan because cincinnati is that good of a football team
8574428 i sort of like it because when you play someone of a high caliber i think the kids really focus in and work hard in the summertime
8574429 and i like that they knew they need to be ready
8574430 you can either be the team that everyone is talking about or you can be talking about them
8574431 our focus has been to get our kids to realize how important it is to duplicate the success we had last year
8574432 part of that is recruitment but most of it is developing your players
8574433 they are well coached and the thing that is a little bit scary is youre watching film on cincinnati and thats just year one under brian kelly
8574434 you dont see a lot of guys messing up guys fumbling the ball or things like that they are a fine oiled machine on both sides of the ball and you know its year two in that system and the guys are going to play faster thats probably the thing that jumps out at you most on film
8574435 we know we are facing a challenge but we are ready to get going
8574436 hes handled it better than i could have imagined anybody could
8574437 including myself he has never missed a meeting or a conditioning session theres never been an excuse that i cant go today its just remarkable
8574438 i definitely think im a different quarterback than i was two years ago
8574439 i love this offense getting a chance to go out there and having the athletes that we have now on this team it helps a lot
8574440 we had 20 seniors on our team last year and 14 of them were starters
8574441 we had a lot of holes to fill but eastern kentucky never goes from having a conference championship team to being 1 10 theres a constant refueling of older kids juniors and seniors make up most of the roster because the program is in good shape
8574442 he knows that weve had frank conversations about that his touchdown to interception will have to be just as high as it was last year for ben mauk 31 tds nine int
8574443 but then i was like this is completely out of my control so my focus was to not think about it and not read about it the only way i ever knew anything about it was when people came up to me and talked about it
8574444 i dont know exactly how people think ill do but i think i can do well in this offense
8574445 hes handled it better than i could have imagined anybody could
8574446 including myself he has never missed a meeting or a conditioning session theres never been an excuse that i cant go today its just remarkable
8574447 i definitely think im a different quarterback than i was two years ago
8574448 i love this offense getting a chance to go out there and having the athletes that we have now on this team it helps a lot
8574449 we had 20 seniors on our team last year and 14 of them were starters
8574450 we had a lot of holes to fill but eastern kentucky never goes from having a conference championship team to being 1 10 theres a constant refueling of older kids juniors and seniors make up most of the roster because the program is in good shape
8574451 he knows that weve had frank conversations about that his touchdown to interception will have to be just as high as it was last year for ben mauk 31 tds nine int
8574452 but then i was like this is completely out of my control so my focus was to not think about it and not read about it the only way i ever knew anything about it was when people came up to me and talked about it
8574453 the question was asked is it more difficult to go 10 3 or to sustain that level
8574454 for me its much more difficult to sustain it because you have to be able to build your program to a level of consistency that gets your players to react on a day to day basis on a level of un conscious competence that is habit forming going into year two we want to get to a habit forming where our kids perform and compete on a day to day basis in a consistent fashion its what were excited about in year two
8574455 i want our players to have a habit of how they prepare each and every week we dont have to tell them how to practice and how to prepare for a game when you get to that level of consistency within your program you know what to expect on game day you dont worry about it you dont worry are we ready or are we not ready it comes down to just playing the game
8574456 we definitely need some game time before you can get to that point
8574457 thats a peak you try as much as you can to get to that point where youre out there and not thinking about it while youre playing thats all in the preparation we know the checks we know that we do this we know where to be at the right time thats what were preparing to do the test is to see if were at that level yet if we can continue to work as hard as hes pushing us we can get to that level
8574458 once you get in the playbook and get to know things it just comes faster now that we know coach kellys philosophy on what he wants done everybody knows how to work fast and get it to where he wants to be un conscious competence its just understanding what he wants
8574459 we dont get a lot of respect we feed off that maybe people are jealous of what weve done i dont know
8574460 we are delighted to bring back this superb russian show to uk audiences the big ballet proved to be a big hit in 2007 and spring 2008 when such attention is continuously paid to issues of size and weight we felt that being larger is not necessarily a restriction and we were right the big ballet is enjoyed by people of all sizes
8574461 whether you admire the fuller figure or not there is absolutely no denying the raw power emanating from the stage when 16 large ladies perform choreographed routines in sync to thunderous music ive witnessed audiences go wild for this troupe
8574462 we eat normal amounts of food and the same kind of food as everybody else our size is in our genes we had the opportunity and under one of the worlds leading choreographers we gained the ability and confidence to take to the stage and show that we are as good at professional dance as thin people
8574463 you definitely have to have a sense of humour to be in the big ballet but we still take our work very seriously having said that its easy to do the splits with 120 kilos of down force
8574464 als ik zeg dat ik met iets anders dan metal gear bezig wil zijn dan meen ik dat vanuit zakelijk politiek en technisch oogpunt zijn er echter altijd redenen om terug te keren
8574465 a parable is closer to it and a cautionary tale that sort of fits up modern celebrity
8574466 when i started looking into it that wasnt the intention to go so far in the direction of what its like to be turned into a famous person to be a celebrity of sorts i know i wanted to set it in the world of photography i thought the links were very strong there and it would have that contemporary feel
8574467 the bridgewater loan is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world
8574468 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8574469 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8574470 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signalling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8574471 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8574472 because both berries and peitc maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of oesophageal cancer
8574473 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8574474 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumour inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8574475 carcinogen altered genes in rat esophagus positively modulated to normal levels of expression by both black raspberries and phenylethyl isothiocyanate
8574476 despite its optimistic oversimplifications the released study indicates that the tank would certainly have demised high up in the atmosphere
8574477 the american people expect their government to work tirelessly to make sure consumer products are safe and that is precisely what my administration is doing

8574575 the reputation of eibtm with its fantastic access to some of the finest meeting and travel planners in europe and the world is a great opportunity to get the word out on our world class destination we are looking to raise the profile of our hidden gem of a city to the international meetings and travel community the only show in which to do that is eibtm
8574576 for the first time ever texas tourism will be present at eibtm in barcelona and by attending this important trade show texas shows its interest in the booming meetings industry the state offers great meeting and incentive opportunities from world class cities such as houston dallas austin and san antonio as well as remote western style resorts
8574577 due to the strong growth in international arrivals to chicago and illinois the chicago convention amp tourism bureau cctb is exhibiting at eibtm for the first time since 2002 having a chicago presence at eibtm this year is timely especially since the city is now an official candidate city for the 2016 olympic and paralympic games
8574578 the european market has always been important to visit floridas meetings and incentives market offering such a diverse choice for any group even more so with the exchange rate being so favourable as interest in the destination continues to grow we are delighted to be doubling our stand size at eibtm as compared to last year

8574583 with the current world average for life expectancy at 66 years the information retention period by the dhs of foreign travelers would exceed most peoples natural lifetimes
8574584 and while acte openly supports any program that will guarantee the security and intergrity of u s borders there is additional concern that the dhs border crossing information system may compromise the privacy of national and foreign travelers without any appreciable increase in security
8574585 the bci 15 year data retention policy for u s citizens appears not to be justifiable in furthering law enforcement purposes and unless the typical foreign visitor was an infant when entering the united states travel files would be kept active years after the subject would in all probability be deceased
8574586 with acte having so many international members we want to ensure that dhs has reasonable and justifiable travel data retention timelines for both u s and foreign visitors

8574605 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8574606 indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that

8574615 with ehtec 2008 selling out it shows how much hospitality professionals in europe need a technology conference like ehtec
8574616 there are many technology issues that are specific to europe and attendees relish the opportunity to discuss these problems and brainstorm solutions we expect ehtec 2009 to be just as packed as previous years
8574617 ehtec has quickly garnered a reputation as being a high quality education conference
8574618 the ehtec advisory council takes that reputation very seriously when it decides the important topics that the conference tackles we want attendees to take as much as they can from this experience

8574634 the new and more extensive master class program was well attended and very successful this year and we want to develop this program even further in 2009
8574635 for aime 2009 we are raising the bar again with an exciting new master class program that includes a special master class for hosted buyers event planners australia will also manage the popular business events forum which will be held on the first morning prior to the exhibition opening the forum looks at key industry issues for the region and attracts a panel of global industry specialists each year with the additional resources of event planners australia one of australias most experienced and creative industry event planners we will be able to deliver an even stronger educational program than ever before

8574637 our visitor research shows that 41 or respondents attended aime 2008 to learn about industry trends so the master classes and the business events forum are a really important part of the event

8574642 i want everybody to understand why i am so proud to have joe biden jill biden beau biden and momma biden and everybody in the biden family
8574643 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8574644 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8574645 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8574646 its not a decision i would make health would and we are waiting to hear from the experts in the ministry who are looking at what the next steps might be if needed we are prepared to make it happen as effectively as possible
8574647 parents need to be aware of the circumstances and be listening for information
8574648 a strategy is being put together and we will be ready at the school level to respond my goal at the moment is to be sure of accommodating any request or expectation
8574649 at this stage we wont be providing immunization clinics but through the provincial health officer we will be monitoring any potential cases that we see in schools and providing those immunization opportunities should the need arise
8574650 i believe that parents always want what is best for their kids though they make different decisions around immunizations
8574651 if theres an outbreak and your kids not immunized keep them home dont just continue to spread the virus around ideally this should be a quarantine issue
8574652 they do it for hepatitis and the boosters you know polio and whatnot they do it at school so why not mumps
8574653 the district was very good and active a few months ago about immunization so i was happy about that
8574654 i havent had any concerns addressed to me for chilliwack its been in the paper for quite a few months
8574655 that being the case we would be offering clinics on a routine basis but i think what well be doing particularly in vancouver is looking for cases and if we start to see cases well start taking more proactive measures
8574656 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8574657 the development and marketing of this expertise requires a strategic plan to enable quebec to become a leader in water management
8574658 at a time when water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world its economic development stirs up substantial opposition however though some people fear harmful exploitation or even the drying up of our water resources it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8574659 were concerned about that we know theres pressure from the u s to export canadas water but we see water as a human right and a public resource
8574660 we dont want to see water commodified and commercialized in this manner
8574661 they see it as an economic opportunity and clearly the motivation here is profit
8574662 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted

8574687 these nattering nabobs of negativism injure the long standing bi partisan consensus on israel for pure political gain you would think that these fear mongerers would feel some degree of shame over their ridiculous charges about the most experienced foreign policy expert in the u s senate but you would be wrong even if the democrats nominated golda meir for the presidential ticket they would charge that she was insufficiently pro israel

8574691 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8574692 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8574693 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8574694 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8574695 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8574696 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8574697 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said
8574698 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne

8574707 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8574708 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8574709 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began

8574711 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8574712 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8574713 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8574714 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8574715 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said
8574716 sanctions are being considered and many other means at next mondays meeting in brussels said kouchner whose country holds the european union presidency

8574720 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8574721 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8574722 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8574723 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8574724 he could be quite a handful at times but he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comedic touch and great emotional depth said howard who plays dr frank campion
8574725 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him he said
8574726 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8574727 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8574728 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8574729 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8574730 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8574731 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8574732 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8574733 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8574734 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8574735 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8574736 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8574737 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8574738 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process

8574747 one of our key decisions as a startup was making our software available for free download payment on the honor system for a fully functional version of our product put us in the same predicament that was almost like following a shareware business model
8574748 what we were doing was unheard of in the security space

8574750 even the small guys are growing astaros having multiple offices is a plus for them they are playing in a global market in terms of being in the american market he does need a presence in the u s
8574751 the initial risk was that open source would hold hichert back but he leveraged it to make it work for his needs
8574752 joining astaros partner program allows resellers to take advantage of a newly built field channel marketing team resources training as well as aggressive margins of up to 40 percent
8574753 more mid size businesses are relying on the internet mission critical security is more urgent for them a small business can fail because of that

8574968 ive had lots of texts and phone calls from managers both from the premier league and the football league
8574969 the support i received is nice because you do forget that youre not bad at your job i look at my record and think im okay im having a tough time at the moment but with the support of the board the players and the supporters im sure we can get through it
8574970 i think the fans were terrific there has obviously been a lot of speculation about me in the newspapers but the derby fans have been great with me and i really appreciated their support at preston and more importantly the team did
8574971 i think ill never stop showing my appreciation for the fans because they have been the best thing thats happened since ive been here its not been the football obviously its been the supporters im so desperate to bring them success
8574972 we know we are in a battle and i have every confidence in paul as has the club chairman andy appelby and the three of us are quite resolute in our belief it can be turned around
8574973 we are not under estimating the disquiet and we know the supporters are extremely unhappy all i can say is that we are working as hard as we can to turn it all around
8574974 have any of the clubs interested in gareth been in touch with us the answer is no its been a pretty lengthy saga and i genuinely thought it would have resolved itself long long before now to tell you the truth i think gareth would have imagined that too
8574975 i can understand the player looking from his viewpoint and i can understand the club from our viewpoint and if we can get some sort of common ground then we are in business and thats what happens
8574976 we are in a commanding position and we dont want to throw it away
8574977 ill be making a couple of changes to the side
8574978 i would have accepted being a goal up and been absolutely delighted we are in a great position and intend to go through
8574979 you should never be comfortable in football but we won 4 1 away from home and we should be able to finish the job off at villa park
8574980 its been exciting to be involved in europe we want to be a club involved in european draws as its great to see the draw on tv and its fantastic travelling round europe

8574996 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding james request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8574997 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday 20th august at which point it was asked by newcastle united to keep the matter private
8574998 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club there is a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today when we believed james request was to be discussed
8574999 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point in which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before canceling the agreement at the 11th hour
8575000 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle united all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastle uniteds transfer valuation of him
8575001 whilst james does have three years left on his current agreement it is common practice that when a young player signs a long term contract this is reviewed and improved on a regular basis with a players development but equally it protects the clubs position in regard to their transfer value
8575002 although the transfer request was handed in seven days ago james has been professional in keeping the matter private whilst giving strong performances for newcastle united

8575135 there are no quick fixes but more can be done especially for children who are really struggling with basic literacy and numeracy and for those children who with a bit of help could reach the next level up
8575136 a recent report found that there is a clear relationship between results at the foundation stage and later ks1 attainment in communication language and literacy
8575137 progress in tackling the problem of poor literacy and numeracy among our youngest children has stalled
8575138 children who dont master basic skills at an early age risk falling even further behind in primary and secondary school
8575139 there must be a much greater focus on early identification of these problems and more one to one support for children with basic literacy and numeracy problems
8575140 last years figures show that that the link between poverty and under achievement is already evident at this early age they confirm the need for the liberal democrat pupil premium to target extra money at disadvantaged pupils

8575333 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8575334 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8575335 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys

8575347 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8575348 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8575349 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit

8575351 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too

8575358 each time he went to a house he had a different explanation as to something associated with the boston hospital
8575359 when the victims were talking and questioning him he would respond with an answer for their questions it was like he was making it up as he went along
8575360 weve been a good risk and the pool had money left over so it returned some to the town
8575361 weve tried to keep up with risk management training and other mma training and we try not to have accidents
8575362 the property and casualty policy also has a clause to cover any litigation against the town and public officials liability
8575363 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8575364 it was a very unusual case the boy had one body but two complete heads
8575365 the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here
8575366 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
8575367 by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8575368 free safety gives me the ability to make some plays whereas at corner you had people throwing away from you or plays that just went away from you a lot theres going to be a lot more production for me
8575369 when youre sitting in the staff room and looking at what our defense does our free safety has got to be able to tackle aaron thomas was a two year starter at corner going into his senior year we said guys were a better team with him at free safety aaron embraced it the great thing with john is that he embraced it last spring
8575370 johns our no 1 right now it doesnt mean that terrence klein wont play there or ryan mcguinness wont play there
8575371 theres four guys for three cornerback free safety spots back there in my mind we want the best fit if we need someone who can really run and fill the alleys and do that stuff out there john clements is good because he can really cover some ground
8575372 it will be interesting to see how i fare with the bigger guys inside
8575373 he can do it all it makes our defense a lot more versatile throwing him back there
8575374 i just hope what were doing in practice defensively carries over
8575375 ive been encouraged weve been flying to the ball and getting some strips out i know were doing that better i think were tackling better
8575376 these things are good but again its going to translate to what happens next saturday
8575377 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8575378 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8575379 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8575380 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8575381 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8575382 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8575383 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8575384 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8575385 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8575386 anyone should contact state police or hampton falls police who has had contact with mr currier through most likely internet services
8575387 i saw it when i was sitting down after i was hit
8575388 there were two girls and a guy i was talking to him i said you hit me call the police he said give me your watch i passed out i woke up by the time i got home it was 3 30 a m i called my mom the ambulance and state police showed up
8575389 i woke up sitting in front of the pink store seacoast bargains inc i was in shock i was out of it
8575390 the filling originally started around 1986 here it is 20 years later and its still going on
8575391 the many many trucks coming and going are a danger to the town
8575392 they keep tracking clay and other materials out onto goodwin road
8575393 if youre up there and watch a truck being unloaded youll see a cloud of dust that comes up
8575394 we are concerned about the possibility that unacceptable debris is getting inadvertently or maliciously mixed in with the fill in a way thats difficult to detect and could end up poisoning the ground and groundwater
8575395 i dont have a lot of concern about material itself in terms of health or environmental hazards it might pose
8575396 there has been a lot of confusion about the issue and im hoping to clear some of this up
8575397 god must have needed her advice so he decided to take her back
8575398 its been kind of stressful but maine showed the most interest
8575399 they were the ones calling me every week and that was a big factor
8575400 i know there was a time when they were playing in the college world series it seems like theyre coming back as a program
8575401 he just wanted to get it out of the way i think hes relieved
8575402 a suspens o das actividades do ex rcito de mahdi ser ilimitado no tempo e todos aqueles que n o respeitarem esta ordem n o poder o ser considerados como membro do grupo
8575403 a actual ministra da sa de parece ser uma honesta defensora do servi o nacional de sa de ter poder os sinais n o s o animadores
8575404 really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit
8575405 well im not trying to go to jail but im also not trying to get on kidz bop
8575406 i dont think we need some eight year old kid re singing im n luv wit a stripper
8575407 classic t pain but different t pain at the same time
8575408 the control is awesome because a lot of dudes dont get control
8575409 so to have the production and the writing and the singing coming from the same heart and same mind the songs just come out way better
8575410 ive been to a lot of strip clubs and ive heard a lot of life stories
8575411 i dont sit and talk to strippers hoping im going to get a song out of it
8575412 but for me im a good listener so i just apply the things ive heard or been through real life situations that way people can relate to your songs way more than if im just making something up trying to be clever
8575413 theres a different situation every 30 minutes in someones life why not write about that instead
8575414 at first all these people were laughing at me for using it
8575415 but now that theyre all using it it sounds like theyre singing a t pain song
8575416 rock n roll is a young mans game and definitely i feel like an imposter a lot of the time
8575417 like i decided at some point in my career that i cant wear shorts anymore
8575418 its a direct quote that weve all heard hey man are you guys in a band
8575419 the other one we get a lot is i remember you guys i had that record you made and then they name like one record from many many years ago and we have to say well we have nine others
8575420 you learn pretty early on that youre not going to make everyone happy
8575421 if youre always playing too much to the gallery youre ultimately limiting yourself and setting yourself up for failure
8575422 ive always written on an acoustic guitar from the very beginning of my days as a songwriter in some ways im way more comfortable doing it like that
8575423 yes it has been a tough year for the travel industry due to many one time but significant events the snowstorm the sichuan earthquake the shortened may holiday olympic games without these one time but significant events the market would have been better
8575424 there might also be some other factors which impact the travel industry in the short term i e the difficulties that the small and medium enterprises face right now despite these short term challenges we are very optimistic about the long term prospect of the travel market in china one of the key drivers is the ever increased consumption power of chinese consumers
8575425 we are doing the right things and believe that our hard work will pay off as we develop our brand and the market rebounds
8575426 we have made several breakthroughs this year both call center and website we have really turned around our call center service as the two survey results showed
8575427 another key achievement was related to our website we upgraded our website by implementing quite a few new applications elong com is now the leading website for online booking in china we saw our online grows faster than offline bookings since our upgrade
8575428 sellers are required to offer at least one shipping option within the maximum and may also offer other options above the maximums for expedited or international shipping
8575429 im an international seller do the shipping cost limits still apply
8575430 i see an inclination in the more respectable part of the royal society to guard against the balloonmania until some experiment likely to prove beneficial either to society or science is proposed
8575431 it does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment which apparently increases the power of man over matter until we can see to what that power may be applied
8575432 when we have learned to manage it we may hope some time or other to find uses for it as men have done for magnetism and electricity of which the first experiments were mere matters of amusement
8575433 pave the way to some discoveries in natural philosophy of which at present we have no conception

8575440 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8575441 moscow alleges that these atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
8575442 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8575443 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8575444 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the of those states
8575445 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth
8575446 a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform

8575497 they were the ones calling me every week and that was a big factor
8575498 i know there was a time when they were playing in the college world series it seems like theyre coming back as a program
8575499 he just wanted to get it out of the way i think hes relieved
8575500 we dont do double sessions the first week because kids are working and we dont want to hurt the local businesses and we ask a lot of them that second week when were away
8575501 but the most important thing we accomplish is the team building
8575502 we do many team building activities and this year we will keep a journal of some things we do we talk a lot about becoming a brotherhood of football players and why we love football and our teammates and coaches
8575503 the kids swim together there are basketball courts and softball fields its hard work but the kids also have a lot of fun
8575504 we purposely make cabins eight to a cabin and we break them up by putting a couple of freshmen a couple sophomores a couple of juniors and a couple of seniors in each one we force the kids to get to know each other
8575505 a freshman comes out with a pretty decent friend who is a senior
8575506 the next week when he starts school he might be a little nervous but now he has a friend in the upper class the kids support one another
8575507 you may think someone is this or he may be that
8575508 it helps break down barriers and it may be corny to say but through this you become one unit its a great experience
8575509 we have reveille at 5 15 every morning for conditioning
8575510 we will talk a lot about commitment to the team and school this year and what it means to give your word about the school policy of drinking and such
8575511 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8575512 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8575513 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8575514 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8575515 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8575516 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8575517 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8575518 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8575519 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8575520 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different

8575523 president chavez has asked that i continue to work with the city and its new mayors to use the experience of london to actually give form to his dream that this can be a first world city in a first world country
8575524 i am proud and honoured to be in a position to be able to offer my advice to those candidates as they start the task of transforming this city for the benefit of all its people
8575525 boris johnson made it clear during his election campaign that he did not want to be on the payroll of hugo chavez and did not believe a poor south american country should be subsidising one of the wealthiest cities in the world
8575526 ken livingstone is free as a private individual to offer his advice and services to whomever he wants
8575527 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8575528 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8575529 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8575530 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit
8575531 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8575532 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8575533 police would like to thank the members of the public who came forward with information to assist the investigation team

8575542 these things are good but again its going to translate to what happens next saturday
8575543 he had a plethora of experience both at brandeis and nantucket we think hell be a great fit for us hes a hard worker has great integrity and is dedicated every reference says hes outstanding both professionally and personally
8575544 he has been a big help during the transition hes been on call for us 24 hours a day hes done anything he can do for us joe is a great guy who will be missed
8575545 one of the things that excited me is that our principal jim daly is a former wrestling coach and the superintendent ed mcdonough is a former football coach at wells
8575546 for our administration to know first hand how an athletic department functions is great
8575547 my sons team was up here three years ago to play the wells pop warner team
8575548 i was really impressed with that group and a few years prior to that i was up here with some friends so i had been to wells before
8575549 everything was organized with a list of things that needed to be done before the start of school i couldnt have walked into a better situation
8575550 i have no problem with them being evicted but the closure order effectively prevents me from letting the flat out to someone else or selling it

8575574 both organizers and politicians would be wise to study them closely
8575575 he admitted to doing this because he was upset with the mother for breaking up with him and starting a relationship with someone else
8575576 i got started at age 40 when a friend asked if i wanted to do a team triathlon
8575577 i asked her what is it what do you do she told me it was a swim bike run event so i said i would do the swim because im pretty good in the water
8575578 i said im doing this by myself next year from there it has grown into a real joy
8575579 this one in the netherlands is the longest one ive ever done
8575580 when i first started doing sprints i never imagined doing a half ironman or an ironman its a matter of putting some time in and taking the next logical step

8575776 apart from that my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8575777 the re formation of the centre has caused a big southward change and gustav is now forecast to pass near the south coast of jamaica

8575779 make poly mesh too many times amaya dufaux i used the sphere 3d one and i put it at 32 by 33 like it said in your tutorial
8575780 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8575781 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8575782 i dont do that any more thats all done thank you for asking a couple of years ago i was like you know enough of this i dont need it it was literally something that happened one morning like yknow fuck that i was very impressed with noel gallagher as you know im an oasis fanatic and noel was like adopts stentorian tone you know what no more cocaine and i thought if he can do it everybody else can do it i had my fun with it it was always more of a social thing we were never like rolling around and spending days in bathroom stalls and peeking out the keyholes of doors for days
8575783 no not at all not at all i wish that would have been easier to explain that the anxiety attack was the result of i was at the tail end of my divorce and there was a lot of things going on that were running amok
8575784 well im glad i dont pay any attention to them is there anything else we can clear up while were at it
8575785 no thats not true at all i give 100 percent credit to the fanzine writer ron quintana for that the band name
8575786 no we did the movie some kind of monster 2005 and as has been well documented he was not pleased with what came in the movie and what came in the wake of it and since then we havent spoken im sure well cross paths one day and usually when we cross paths its all ok theres the public relationship and theres the private relationship people say kerry king and metallica whoo but whenever i see kerry king we hug we laugh we talk we embrace i havent seen dave since i filmed that scene in the movie and im sure ill see him again and maybe it wont be the same but when did he leave the band 24 years ago 25 years ago every time ive seen him since then its always been hey how are you doing whats going on and then theres the shit talking thing in the press and then i see him three years later and its fine again
8575787 you know what of course weve thought about it and every time we think about it we go thats not necessary you know we even thought about remixing st anger you think about it for 12 seconds and you hear yourself have a conversation about it and you go no you do the best you can in the moment and you dont go back and fix it
8575788 im so beyond good and bad terminologies like that dont work for me i know a lot of people dont think its a good album i appreciate that and i respect it i know a lot of people find it very difficult what i am 100 percent sure of is that if it wasnt for st anger death magnetic wouldnt sound the way it does st anger had to happen if you cant find anything musically to appreciate which i respect at least respect st angers existence if it wasnt for us completely reinventing the songwriting process for the sake of our own survival me and you probably wouldnt be on the phone right now because there would be no death magnetic james hetfield would be in nashville playing country music id be off producing films and kirk hammett would be on tour with joe satriani it had to be the way it was if wed fallen into making records the way we used to in the 1990s im pretty sure the band would have imploded we had to go down that path of sitting in a room with a guy helping us holding our hand and making us talk to each other we did it and we survived it and we can now talk about it in the past tense a lot of people are talking about how wonderful death magnetic is and i can appreciate that so st anger has a role in all this that is beyond whether the album is good or bad
8575789 ha ha well i dont know maybe james would be off hunting and id be selling my metallica collection i dont know luckily we dont have to find out just yet
8575790 it was just like lets play some songs for a few people fine let the people talk whats wrong with people talking the managers sometimes get a little overprotective and listen theyre just trying to earn their commission but just relax its a fuckin rocknroll song when everybody gets super wound up about this stuff it just gets a little ridiculous so fine a bunch of people have heard some songs and they seem to like the songs i think its ok that they talk about liking the songs the whole thing was weird because they asked people to take the stuff down and we didnt know anything about it then all of a sudden we heard about it and its like dont tell people to take something down thats positive
8575791 i wish i could give you an answer but sometimes i have to remove myself i cant micromanage every detail of the band any more its just not that interesting to me but every once in a while you have to get involved and say everybody just fuckin chill out for a second i mean we even have a part of our own website where we put the links up to these reviews sometimes i get into a little bit of a pissing contest with our managers i wanted to start playing some of the new songs in may when we started touring and they got all bent out of shape about that but everythings all fine we dont take it too seriously
8575792 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
8575793 companies cannot afford to be out of action for any extended period of time because they risk losing customers in the short term and damaging their relationship in the longer term
8575794 this survey highlights the fact that some businesses have a long way to go in getting their plans up to scratch
8575795 what i really liked was that the smartinspect log console feels like visual studio and is a tcp ip server which means that you can point an app at a machine to log via tcp ip
8575796 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
8575797 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
8575798 it isnt life that matters its the courage you bring to it
8575799 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
8575800 it isnt life that matters its the courage you bring to it
8575801 ability is what you are capable of doing motivation determines what you do attitude determines how well you do it
8575802 success is not measured by what you accomplish but by the opposition you have encountered and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds
8575803 baseball is the only field of endeavor where a man can succeed three times out of ten and be considered a good performer
8575804 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
8575805 let me through let me through i am the son of the victim
8575806 when it comes to v lkl im happy both with the equipment and all the other factors
8575807 one thing i particularly value is the chance to work very closely with the racing technology development team at v lkl but the teamwork is outstanding in all other areas as well
8575808 the fact that niki wants to race with and for v lkl for another three years is a tremendous vote of confidence
8575809 im very glad to have her in the team particularly in view of the upcoming world cup in re where she is considered among the top favorites in several disciplines at once
8575810 the alpine community has been raving about the ride our wcr metal series since its release in january of 2006
8575811 the original wcr metal was stripped down to the very basics for maximum weight savings and race performance but it did not meet some customers expectations for longevity the new wcr metal 2009 is substantially stronger and more durable than our previous metal alpine boards with an even damper more stable ride after testing the new version for several months i found that it did not compromise performance in the slightest

8575828 todays achievement is the result of dedicated effort by the entire x2 technology demonstrator program team
8575829 we look forward to expanding the flight envelope for this demonstrator and will continue to conduct market analysis to determine the next steps
8575830 if theres one at sprucefield then the people of northern ireland will come here not the one in dublin
8575831 but if you dont build at sprucefield theres a motorway practically from sprucefield to dublin and therell be down there in an hour and a half
8575832 we do not have any problems with a standalone john lewis store opening in sprucefield
8575833 what concerned us and our members about the previous planning application were the 30 additional retail units which would have gone alongside the proposed john lewis store
8575834 it astounds me that for 55 years these two individuals so clearly committed to one another were considered by the law to be nothing more than friends for so long and through so much they were second class citizens when it came to their relationship yet the most fleeting heterosexual liaison could be sanctified in a drunken moment in vegas with no forethought and no true commitment and there are some who dare say that these two women bound b y mutual love for so long were trivializing marriage if what del martin and phyllis lyons had was trivial then i say there are a hell of lot of marriages that could use some trivializing of that sort i am pleased that del spent the last ten weeks of her life as the legal spouse of the woman she had loved for most of her life and i firmly believe that this november the voters of california will not vote to overturn marriage equality but even if they do it will be too late to take that away from del martin
8575835 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8575836 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8575837 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8575838 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8575839 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8575840 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend
8575841 really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit
8575842 back in the neighborhood where the crime was perpetrated and where the victim and her family continue to live
8575843 this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
8575844 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
8575845 it is not enough to restrict the death penalty to cases of murder or aggravated robbery
8575846 the death penalty must be abolished in its entirety because it has never been proven to be a deterrent its maintenance on the statute books violates the spirit of the truth and reconciliation commission trc
8575847 the government says it is committed to the implementation of the trcs recommendations yet it is backtracking on one key issue the abolition of the death penalty this sends conflicting signals
8575848 the time is now to mount our campaign mobilising abolitionist campaigners and civil society to continue this campaign the constitutional review commission must be made to understand
8575849 when you consider that we have come out of a war that consumed many lives i think it is appropriate some of the punitive laws are kept on our statute books though with some adjustments
8575850 the death penalty cannot altogether be abolished because crimes like murder are still being committed
8575851 there are no facilities for recreation and skills training for death row inmates this is inhuman and degrading once in the cell on death row you are isolated deprived of basic services and psychologically tortured
8575852 they all get normal rations of meals toiletries and supplementary diets in fact the prisoners on death row get better diets than ordinary convicts the prison laws do not discriminate against death row inmates
8575853 there are no workshops no libraries or recreational facilities for inmates and this in no way helps the prisoners to be reformed
8575854 we consider it mental torture and a clear denial of their rights to a speedy dispensation of justice
8575855 justice delayed is justice denied these people must have their appeals heard or be released without any further delays
8575856 to ensure that death row inmates are not treated like lesser mortals

8575858 big nand makers like samsung hynix and toshiba may expand more aggressively this year despite the glut because they can hurt rivals and grab market share
8575859 i had a dream last night that me and gordon ramsay actually had a fight on the pitch
8575860 thats how excited i am about the game im even dreaming about it in my dream gordon kicked me and the ref was in the middle trying to break it up im hoping this is not a premonition
8575861 hes not just the top manager in europe hes top of the world
8575862 you cant work at that level and stay with one club for so long if you do not have exceptional qualities it is so difficult
8575863 so for me he is the best manager in the world and the one everyone else has to look up to
8575864 i know sir alex but i havent played against him so i am looking forward to the game which i know will be very difficult
8575865 he is with us but i will see tomorrow if he plays or not i have not yet made up my mind
8575866 its always a tough game down there theyve recruited well and theyve got a lot of good players and in some instances it must be quite difficult for ernie merrick to select a squad or even an 11 with the amount of playing talent that hes got down there
8575867 theyve got big expectations this year in regards to winning the league and i know our boys are well and truly looking forward to the challenge
8575868 weve got two players out of the whole a league who are in the australian squad and they come from newcastle jade north is not only in the squad but up until the last game was in the 11
8575869 jesper will start tomorrow and i think hell play a more forward going position
8575870 it is a must win game if we can win this one we will go into the break in a really good position
8575871 he agostino was probably ready last week but we were just a little bit precautionary with him so hes ready to go
8575872 its pleasing to have diego back training because he adds a lot to our team hes still lacking a bit of match fitness and he pulled up a bit sore after yesterdays training so he will probably miss out this week
8575873 its a shame he ronaldo couldnt join because he is great player but not to worry we probably have a team which is strong enough to start an important league and with which to battle for all our objectives
8575874 we have a squad which we can trust fully and now we have van der vaart
8575875 its obvious that the presidents mind was always set on bringing him ronaldo but if the player has caused confusion wanting to come and then not then calderon couldnt do anything about it
8575876 people could demand explanations its true but calderons results speak for themselves two years two leagues
8575877 carlos is doing well it would have been great if he had been able to play a game before sunday i wish he had been eligible to play tonight
8575878 but he is making good progress he has been training with us over the last two or three days and been doing really fine he has done a lot of running as well
8575879 he is really keen to make his mark in the premier league
8575880 steve is doing fine but wouldnt be as well advanced as cuellar he is doing pretty well although it feels as if ive been saying that for the last 10 days
8575881 he is coming along nicely and i think he will probably be able to join in with us in training towards the end of the week
8575882 everyone was expecting us to qualify but we knew the result from the first leg could make this a tricky game
8575883 we didnt want to take risks and in the first half bergen didnt surrender tactically we didnt play well and there were errors
8575884 we played better in the second half but unfortunately they scored and of course i was worried
8575885 with their big guys all it needed was one long ball and a slip from us for them to score
8575886 they werent that dangerous but one good cross could have seen us lose
8575887 i am really happy to play in a team like milan
8575888 for me this is a dream come true everything has happened really fast in a week
8575889 everything here is incredible the people are very easy going and they have made me feel like im at home
8575890 to have become european champion with the under 17 national team and of course at the age of 18 to have arrived to a big club as arsenal
8575891 in london i have learned a lot it has been a life school and manager arsene wenger has helped me
8575892 today i can say i have reached a superior level by coming to this club i want to give 100 and improve every day
8575893 this team wants to return to the champions league and i will do everything i can to help
8575894 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8575895 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8575896 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8575897 they were up in arms because theyd all passed and couldnt see why they had to bother to do the exam again
8575898 but safety is paramount for the producers and they felt they couldnt take a chance they wanted to be sure they knew their stuff
8575899 they were on the verge of walking out until they were promised a day at a spa if they agreed to resit it
8575900 theyre tired and stressed and theres a lot of tension and sometimes hes the last person you want around

8575906 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8575907 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8575908 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8575909 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8575910 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8575911 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8575912 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8575913 we spoke about that possibility at the start of the eason but lets wait and see how things turn out first
8575914 contrary to falsehoods circulating on the internet the rangers have never considered trading scott gomez to clear cap space for sundin nor will they

8575949 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8575950 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8575951 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began

8575956 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships

8575962 carlos is doing well it would have been great if he had been able to play a game before sunday i wish he had been eligible to play tonight
8575963 but he is making good progress he has been training with us over the last two or three days and been doing really fine he has done a lot of running as well
8575964 he is really keen to make his mark in the premier league
8575965 steve is doing fine but wouldnt be as well advanced as cuellar he is doing pretty well although it feels as if ive been saying that for the last ten days
8575966 he is coming along nicely and i think he will probably be able to join in with us in training towards the end of the week

8576007 i was talking with the doctor and we talked with him he said he would play with pain and after it he would have an operation
8576008 he knew he had to keep going tonight because he was having the operation tomorrow
8576009 weve been in a final and a semi final over recent years and we want more
8576010 first we have to win the qualifier and this was a tough game
8576011 but we have always said it will go to the wire
8576012 one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8576013 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8576014 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8576015 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8576016 he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8576017 a player may not play uefa club competition matches for more than one competing club in the course of the same season
8576018 fielded for another club that is currently in the same competition
8576019 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3bn
8576020 united position of a summit of central asian nations would serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
8576021 sanctions are being considered and many other means kouchner said in paris
8576022 active role in resolving the conflict in georgia according to the draft of a joint statement released by the kremlin
8576023 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8576024 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8576025 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8576026 they will live to regret it shevardnadze said in an interview in japans
8576027 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8576028 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8576029 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8576030 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8576031 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said
8576032 in the wind the ashes fly the poison crown the charcoal ground he sang
8576033 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8576034 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8576035 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8576036 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8576037 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8576038 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8576039 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said
8576040 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8576041 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8576042 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8576043 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8576044 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8576045 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8576046 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8576047 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8576048 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8576049 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from
8576050 in some ways communications staff are the unsung heroes of this whole process
8576051 very bad and the situation was becoming worse at brisbanes hospitals
8576052 i think his speech was directed at other australian states and not at victoria john brumby said in melbourne
8576053 much further down that track than any of the other states
8576054 weve put in place a whole series of systems which provides comparative information on performance data and so on to parents mr carpenter said
8576055 for too long i think the federal government has walked away from those schools that are doing the toughest job out there she said
8576056 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality she told abc radio
8576057 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8576058 close tight knit group was hoping to go back tomorrow and use the memory of priestley to get through it she said
8576059 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy the spokeswoman said
8576060 they were incredibly close their two characters just got married the spokeswoman said
8576061 like other members of the cast and crew jolene is struggling to come to terms with the death of her dear friend overnight
8576062 no one loved her doing it more than mark he was thrilled she said
8576063 the cast have been rocked by two tragedies the seven spokeswoman said
8576064 he could be quite a handful at times but he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comedic touch and great emotional depth said howard who plays dr frank campion
8576065 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him he said
8576066 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8576067 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8576068 to my knowledge this is the highest price for any slice of the cake sold at auction
8576069 sanctions are being considered and many other means at next mondays meeting in brussels said kouchner whose country holds the european union presidency
8576070 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept the situation in georgia he told reporters adding that he did not want to
8576071 they can just swear on a religious book and pretend it never actually took place
8576072 i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8576073 we hope the relevant countries properly resolve the issues through dialogue and consultation
8576074 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8576075 whens the last time you heard about someone facing 10 years in prison for not renewing a gun permit
8576076 overcharged and selectively prosecuted by the very d a who is the focus of my book
8576077 he will be fine its not life threatening or anything like that but he does have some broken bones and hes stable
8576078 im still in a way feeling like that big guy that 37 stone man
8576079 i look at myself and its like another person inside of me i lie in bed and its all hanging over
8576080 its hard to cope with every day i look down at myself and feel miserable
8576081 hes under a psychiatrist and i have to watch my son
8576082 im sure every mother would feel the same way i dont want to lose my son
8576083 hes now become a person whos trapped in his home
8576084 he wears a tight vest which he hopes hides his excess skin
8576085 if i could pay for this operation i would but i cant
8576086 my dad died when i was 17 and i went downhill from there
8576087 at first when i started to lose weight it was great
8576088 then i started to notice i was losing the weight but there was skin hanging everywhere
8576089 we can go to an external review panel and were just building a case for it
8576090 i wanted to be a counsellor to help other people but when i started to lose confidence i said i couldnt do this
8576091 it would give me a better life able to go out there and find work and do something for myself
8576092 i want to go out there and not be noticed for the big guy but just be noticed as an average joe

8576113 linno il simbolo dello stato e dellunit nazionale ha affermato il dirigente scolastico luigi roffia ed giusto che i ragazzi lo cantino
8576114 se vogliamo costruire lo spirito nazionale dei nostri giovani osserva vi sono forse passi pi concreti da fare che non puntare sui simboli come linno e la bandiera che pure sono importanti
8576115 noi siamo dei tecnici degli amministrativi spiega e applichiamo norme e circolari mi pare un po improvvida luscita di un funzionario della scuola su questo tema sono tematiche squisitamente politiche e quindi di competenza del ministro oppure del presidente della regione

8576146 akos is back training and thats a massive boost for everyone
8576147 were mindful that hes not had a full pre season and as a result hes doing some extra fitness sessions with john harbin performance manager
8576148 all things being equal though he should be in contention to make the squad for our home fixture against southampton in mid september
8576149 hes really stepped up his fitness levels in recent weeks and the work hes doing with john is working wonders
8576150 hes already joining in with the first team warm up sessions and it shouldnt be too long before hes involved in the technical sessions too
8576151 realistically were looking at rowan returning to the squad in the coming weeks
8576152 its a different injury to the one that kept him sidelined last season but once again well have to treat it carefully
8576153 theres never a good time to get injured but with the international break imminent the two week period between fixtures will almost certainly mean he misses far fewer matches than he might have at another stage in the season
8576154 their away kit looks a bit like the arsenal shirt
8576155 at 6ft 3in liam will give us another option up front he had an impressive spell at barnet scoring over 50 goals for the club and i hope he can recreate that form at darlington
8576156 in his brief time so far with darlington billy has shown the potential to play a prominent part in our frontline during this league two campaign so we have extended his loan spell to reflect that
8576157 the bottom line is this theyve responded to high inflation by australian historical standards the highest inflation in 16 years which is what we inherited last year
8576158 and what were seeing is the washthrough of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the liberals
8576159 our practical plan is to see the economy through in the long term and that means making some tough decisions to do that
8576160 nisu samo rusi odgovorni za ono to se dogodilo odgovoran je i saaka vili nije se potrudio izbje i ovaj stra ni sukob
8576161 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8576162 i assign police to do this task without forcibly dispersing the rally
8576163 we still maintain our goals one all parties have to commit that they will not amend the constitution at all two the government has to quit
8576164 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8576165 maintains the stability and public confidence in the nations financial system by insuring deposits supervising financial institutions and managing receiverships
8576166 the presence of nato forces in afghanistan has not only not helped ensure security but has led to the deaths of innocent people on a regular basis
8576167 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighbouring countries
8576168 this is how they pave the way for political and military influence and unfortunately their unilateral actions are continuing
8576169 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8576170 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8576171 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8576172 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8576173 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century
8576174 the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons
8576175 and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8576176 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8576177 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8576178 now he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8576179 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8576180 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8576181 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8576182 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8576183 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8576184 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8576185 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8576186 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8576187 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8576188 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected

8576207 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8576208 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8576209 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8576210 we should wear kits that represent the history of the club and this one certainly does that youll think about that night and that team when you wear this particularly with the date embroidered around the badge the fans will love it as well
8576211 to all newcastle fans trust us please we are moving in the right direction and under kevin keagan we have a very bright future thank you
8576212 wise is the problem at the toon can ashley not see that
8576213 i will tell you that we are very keen to try to strengthen our side between now and transfer deadline day 1st september
8576214 i am sure i could get one or two in anyway but it is just adding the sort of quality that i would want and that is exactly what i will be trying to do
8576215 am i a fan of milner he was nearly here two years ago he nearly signed two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until anything happens
8576216 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago

8576221 none of our transfers have been done in less than 3 days
8576222 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8576223 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8576224 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8576225 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season gareth wants to concentrate on playing on the best of his ability for aston villa and we hope this draws a line under the matter
8576226 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted
8576227 i would have said only a few weeks ago i was resigned myself to the fact he would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in a friendly and when he didnt come with us to malaga
8576228 if he does stay i will be delighted it will be a really big bonus for us
8576229 i think gareth has played four games in quick succession with the one for england four in 12 days after a stop start pre season which hasnt helped him
8576230 he will have better days for us than on saturday at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of the four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season and all of those things i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that
8576231 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8576232 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8576233 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true
8576234 were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8576235 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of us dollars of public funds
8576236 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network

8576244 we may have fewer students and staff since the kindergarten has been moved
8576245 we are very excited about our new o w l curriculum it is very challenging while remaining developmentally appropriate for our students
8576246 o w l stands for opening the world of learning and with its emphasis on building oral language and concepts it will provide a strong foundation for the early literacy skills that we have been building for years
8576247 we know that the younger children are the more closely tied their learning and achievement are to what is going on in their families it stands to reason that providing resources to families to support learning has the potential to make an amazing impact on families and the community
8576248 the time has come for this community to make a shift to actively supporting literacy development and it makes sense for those of us in early education to spearhead the effort

8576336 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8576337 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8576338 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8576346 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8576347 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8576361 this will open up a huge market for the iphone which previously had been stymied by a lack of basic business security and application functionality
8576362 as far as blackberry v iphone is concerned some companies will want the blackberry some will want the iphone
8576363 in the irish market today nearly every business person is carrying a device that can deliver email to them on the move
8576364 for many firms because of its easy set up the blackberry is the device of choice while for quality of voice calls the palm is a favourite

8576366 our iskcon properties are not for demigod worship our devotees are to exclusively worship radha krishna gaura nitai and balarama subhadra and jagannatha and to also celebrate other various
8576367 we always offer proper respects to all the demigods we must always know however that no demigod is equal to or above the supreme lord
8576368 our iskcon temples are known as hare krishna or radha krishna temples this is what we want people also in india to understand even on our spiritual sky incense packet there is radha krishna
8576369 our iskcon devotees exclusively worship radha and krishna and of course lord caitanya mahaprabhu
8576370 why worship the demigods when they all get all their power from krishna anyway
8576371 those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures
8576372 men of small intelligence worship the demigods and their fruits are limited and temporary those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods but my devotees ultimately reach my supreme planet

8576374 among the people i see for pre marriage counselling at least 90pc of them are cohabiting and maybe 15pc already have children together
8576375 its just the norm now everyone is living with everyone we are on the brink of having cohabitation legally recognised and its needed because just as cohabiting is common so too is litigation between people who cohabit
8576376 common law is a phrase we often hear but theres no such thing its a misnomer
8576377 you have no marriage like rights if you are not married and cohabitants do not have any legal or other protection statistically there are an increasing number of couples cohabiting so there are also an increasing number of difficulties arising
8576378 we repeatedly hear cases for example where an unmarried couple buy a house together
8576379 id advise people going into a situation like that to execute a document stating that one party is providing a loan that should be repaid when the house is sold but people dont want to ask the person with whom theyre about to move in to start signing documents theyre afraid it indicates a lack of trust
8576380 it will be better than the current situation but certainly doesnt go as far as some people might believe
8576381 the recommendation would still be that cohabitants would enter into a cohabitation agreement stating the terms of their living together and work out early on what would be fair and appropriate in the event of relationship breakdown or death
8576382 we had stupidly a very relaxed arrangement he paid the mortgage and i paid for the food and bills id give him cash as well to make up my half or just pay for things day to day we had signed an agreement that the place would be split 50 50 if anything happened but now hes disputing that and saying that i didnt pay towards the mortgage ive no evidence of the money i gave him if we had married everything would have been split but now ive no protection at all
8576383 the widespread myth that cohabitation is a way to prepare for marriage is flat out wrong couples who marry after living together are actually 50pc more likely to divorce than those who remained apart
8576384 many couples call cohabitation a trial marriage that is another myth with 80pc of cohabiting couples breaking up it is more like a trial divorce in which the only question is whether they will break up in a pre marital divorce or afterwards in a real divorce
8576385 a relationship will survive if its going to survive whether the couple lives together before marriage or lives together instead of marriage or whatever if both people in the couple feel comfortable with cohabiting then thats okay for their relationship in my opinion it makes no difference whether people live together or not if a relationship is destined to survive and if a couple works at the relationship then it will survive regardless of their living arrangements
8576386 a lot of the people i come across who have children are claiming benefits that they wouldnt receive if they got married its happening a lot that a couple are living together but shes registered as a single mother while he gives his mothers address as his home address
8576387 less people believe in the concept of marriage nowadays and they find that its often just easier to live together a lot of people around here just cant afford to get married anyway often its a case of deciding whether to buy a house or get married because they havent the money for both
8576388 many couples who live together never marry cohabitation has become a substitute for marriage in the us the marriage rate has plunged 50pc since 1970 why cohabitation has diverted tens of millions from getting married at all
8576389 unless the soaring cohabitation rates are reduced in ireland i predict your marriage numbers will plunge and your divorce rate will soar rather than being the rare european country which cherishes marriage your numbers will begin to look like those of the
8576390 we both come from broken homes so we have come to realise that marriage doesnt mean forever and dont really see the purpose of it other than its what is expected from us by society
8576391 we are happy in our relationship and are confident we will be together long term with or without getting married
8576392 once married some people feel thats it no more effort required a cohabiting couple doesnt feel that sense of institution and therefore tries harder to keep their relationship happy
8576393 i think i would lose my individuality and independence if i married everything would be ours and people would see me as michaels wife not myself
8576394 our it goal is operate more efficiently and more effectively the business case specifically for it was very clear because the competition continues to get stronger it really needed to focus on several things one of them being the need to leverage global resources to support our growth initiatives
8576395 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8576396 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8576397 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8576398 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8576399 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has

8576449 s lo una vez se convirti en algo realmente malo
8576450 por lo que los quise asustar imit a un depredador y me tir con los brazos abiertos entonces ellos se movieron y me disloqu un hombro
8576451 por la gravedad de los delitos que se les imputan no queda otra alternativa que la c rcel com n y esto adem s porque est n en condiciones f sicas y ps quicas de ser alojados en un penal la edad no da derechos ni privilegios
8576452 esa es una facultad del tribunal que puede o no concederla
8576453 es una burla a la sociedad que una persona que est acusada por delitos de lesa humanidad como bussi siga en un country debe pagar las consecuencias de sus actos si uno se porta mal debe ir a la c rcel

8576458 we are set to face the continent as we are now
8576459 we promise to do well and present to them the african cups as a show of appreciation
8576460 between 1pm and 2pm we hope all our team zimbabwe athletes will be at our stand at the nelson mandela hall meeting the public on friday
8576461 we hope that the athletes will form part of the procession into the glamis arena for the official opening ceremony
8576462 it was not my first time racing against bolt because i had taken him on about four or five times before
8576463 i knew the way he runs but i was more concerned on how i was going to execute my own race
8576464 i speak here in my personal capacity and i know that i also share the view of many other people in zimbabwe
8576465 we have a swimming pool called les brown near monomotapa crowne plaza and i for one do not know who that les brown is and what he or she did for swimming
8576466 it is very sad because teams are failing to travel but to make matters worse no zifa official was on hand to really explain what the position was
8576467 it is also unfortunate that such developments inconvenience everyone from the paying public the host teams and those that are supposed to travel
8576468 but you also tend to understand that it is too costly for a team travel all the way from victoria falls and feel for the clubs maybe we should have played these early rounds on a regional basis
8576469 iniziando a beneficiare in maniera significativa dei risultati delle azioni di razionalizzazione industriale e riorganizzazione produttiva effettuati nel corso dellanno 2007
8576470 the good news is that in 2012 in london and the south east prices will recover to the levels they were in 2007
8576471 august as exceptionally quiet and july was also very quiet there is likely to be an early shut down of the market for christmas so november will be dead as well as december in any down period the quiet times come early
8576472 the good news is that in 2012 in london and the south east prices will recover to the levels they were in 2007

8576478 to start with no computer going into space should have autorun enabled simply disabling autorun would have almost certainly rendered the worm inert given that age of the worm and its low risk ranking it is probable that current av software was not being used either
8576479 fundamentally there are two types of readers here the first type will disable autorun and be more secure the second type will eventually be victims
8576480 fundamentally there are two types of readers here the first type will disable autorun and be more secure the second type will eventually be victims
8576481 fundamentally there are two types of readers here the first type will disable autorun and be more secure the second type will eventually be victims
8576482 meh i wont run into any viruses why spend time getting something thatll keep me secure
8576483 we have limited resources but there are people like mrs machube george mutendadzamera delta beverages official and newsome mutema caps united assistant coach whom we have to thank because they have done a lot to make it possible to adequately prepare for this game
8576484 we are looking to build on a strong result at home because if you dont win at home it would be very difficult to win away you cannot climb a tree from the top
8576485 we are not even underestimating reunion even though we beat them the last time out
8576486 at under 17 level you cannot talk about experience but it is a question of talent we dont really have powerhouses thats why madagascar and zambia are doing well at junior level and that is why ghana and nigeria also do well at the world junior championships
8576487 that is what we are aiming to do and you can only do with maximum support and giving the young boys exposure
8576488 we have made some changes to the team but i cannot say they are prominent changes because those who have matured we have let them graduate into the under 20 and under 23 teams
8576489 it is our mandate to select a lot of players to develop for the benefit of other national teams and we can always call on those that are eligible if the need arises
8576490 but 11 of the 20 players we had in south africa are still with the team and ntokozo tshuma who we would have loved to have left for the united states four days ago for trials
8576491 when we played malawi it was the first time for most of these players to play on the artificial turf and it must be remembered that these are school boys so some of them found the pitch slippery because they did not have the right type of boots
8576492 in fact even premiership players have complained that the turf is slippery but with the few days we have spent training at the venue this week there had been a huge improvement and they begin to adjust
8576493 we noted the improvement yesterday when they played against eagles juniors in another friendly and besides the turf we have also been working on polishing our grey areas
8576494 i notice that there are some players here who are six and seven years
8576495 in brazil where i first trained as a coach this is the age they go out to look for in terms of talent
8576496 a lot of you watched our team dynamos playing in the african champions league
8576497 we allowed some goals to go in and even with the national teams here in zimbabwe we have a problem in defence
8576498 i for one always point out that defenders should never leave a striker behind them but should try and put a defender in front every time
8576499 if you leave a striker behind you he can get the advantage just like what happened in our last game against al ahly where we had four of our defenders in the box but just one egyptian striker managed to score because he had been left behind
8576500 playing football will remain the same but the skills taught at an early age will mould the player as he grows
8576501 i see that you are all young and my advice if for you to listen to your coaches
8576502 i can just give an example of players at dynamos right now who are getting some good money by playing in the champions league
8576503 football leagues in europe pay better and some of you can one day be able to play in those leagues if you remain disciplined
8576504 peter ndlovu benjani mwaruwari vusa nyoni and cephas chimedza are some of the zimbabwean players who have played in europe and there is nothing to stop players from stars academy from doing the same
8576505 many of you are lucky to be attending an academy where you can develop your soccer skills unlike some who just play football in the streets
8576506 so i urge you to use your time here at the academy wisely and i emphasise that you should be disciplined in football at home and at school and stay aware from aids and drugs
8576507 some people may not be academically gifted but they can make a good life out of football
8576508 i grew up in the rural areas in chivhu but ended up playing for the national team metal box and later dynamos
8576509 a lot of you also know bruce grobbelaar who went on to become one of the best goalkeepers in the world
8576510 bruce started playing as an under 16 at callies where motor action is and then joined zimbabwe saints later highlanders before moving to canada
8576511 he later came to liverpool and so the same can happen to you
8576512 as stars academy we want to produce stars and i honestly know that we are in the right direction in terms of our plan to develop football at grassroots level
8576513 there are a lot challenges we are facing but remain grateful and motivated by high profile figures like chidzambwa who come here to help
8576514 we have programmes in place for more coaching clinics and hope to tap from any other seasoned coaches and current players in the premiership and national team
8576515 once again we are happy that the harare city council especially the mayor muchadeyi masunda appreciate our efforts and actually officially launched this project
8576516 it feels good to be back home and meeting all the people after the athens games i never expected the welcome i got when i came back home and i was overwhelmed
8576517 it was just fantastic getting all the support from people i love zimbabwe and it is my home and since athens the support zimbabweans have given me has kept me motivated
8576518 going into the games in china i was never under any pressure and my objective really was to get very good times and be on the podium
8576519 i believe i just did that and got the silver medals
8576520 it was good getting the silver medals but i began to get a little frustrated and tired of getting the silver
8576521 i was frustrated and showed my emotions to my coach kim bracklin but i was able to channel that emotion into something positive and got the gold
8576522 yes i got a lot of questions on zimbabwe but as team zimbabwe we had gone to the games to show the world out there that there are lot of good things about zimbabwe
8576523 we are all really proud and i was able to go and support some of my teammates after my competitions
8576524 this is a momentous occasion and i thought that i should not sit in the office i have come here personally to welcome the athletes home
8576525 in opening parliament president mugabe made special mention of team zimbabwe and coventry in particular
8576526 now on behalf of the government and people of zimbabwe we are pleased and i say welcome back home kirsty
8576527 so many negative things have been said about zimbabwe and some people never thought that anything positive will come out of zimbabwe
8576528 in zimbabwe we produce gold and export but now kirsty has brought our gold to zimbabwe and this is no mean achievement
8576529 we are grateful to kirsty and team zimbabwe for putting zimbabwe on the world map
8576530 we are proud of you and you did us proud and i hope you will keep it up and represent the county with conviction at the 2012 games in london
8576531 i have heard about miss coventrys name for a long time now and now i am glad that she won one gold and three silver medals from the olympic games held in china and hosted by our people
8576532 she won her second olympic gold and we are proud of you and i am very happy to have come to welcome you on behalf of the chinese government and people
8576533 i am sure miss coventry will get more medals for herself and the zimbabwe people
8576534 i return to tennessee even more convinced that we need to drill here and drill now
8576535 organizaciones ecologistas piden al ministro sebasti n que demuestre su compromiso con el ahorro energ tico y limite las emisiones de co2 de los coches

8576543 and this i find alarming with the previous owners private data still on it
8576544 im excited to hear just what barack is going to say
8576545 i think there is going to be a big change in the country in november
8576546 he is a real eloquent speaker and that drew a lot of people
8576547 this is the first candidate who has come along in years probably since jfk who has excited americans to the point where they want to fight to bring their country back to no 1
8576548 povert ed evangelici aggressivi le micce che hanno acceso la rabbia degli estremisti

8576550 up to 50 000 people who suffer a minor heart attack each year should receive better treatment they say
8576551 clinicians and other physicians really need to be alerted to this
8576552 some of these people may have been told it is only a minor heart attack dont worry too much about it whereas actually it is a wake up call and they need the best treatment in terms of unblocking the artery
8576553 i noticed the difference from the first moment we turned up in scotland and did a fielding drill and straight away i noticed it was different
8576554 the energy the buzz the skill levels and the fitness of the guys was different which is not saying it was bad when i was in the squad before but there has been an increase in intensity definitely and its fantastic
8576555 i dont think it happens overnight but its down to a lot of hard work
8576556 we had to do it for the fans because i think everyone is agreed that the fulham game was not the way we play
8576557 sometimes you cant play your game but its the way you behave on the pitch and the fans have always been there for us since the first day i came to arsenal
8576558 the defeat at fulham was a really big blow and we felt sorry about it but now it has passed and we have to do the right things for the fans
8576559 the main objective now is to win something this year
8576560 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal we have to win things i hope this year will be a good one but once again i am sure we can do it
8576561 saturday was a big disappointment and we have to remember what happened but we have to keep that behind and look forward
8576562 for a club like arsenal we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit so thats what we tried to do and we showed with the players we have got if everyone is playing the same way we can have a great result
8576563 i think last night he showed against twente that he is a great player
8576564 everyone has a bad time last year against birmingham i had a big mistake that was my thing of course william is a big player a more experienced player and he is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8576565 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes i made a mistake like i told you and i think william is a great player and he scored again against twente everyone is behind him and it will remain like this
8576566 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted from your club your manager your team mates and the fans
8576567 the worst thing about dying is getting the family together
8576568 dont expect this title to show up in the us arcades
8576569 ab framtiden har ambitionen att bygga mellan 400 och 600 hyresl genheter per r ven om det dr jer 10 15 r tills de ger vinst
8576570 my dream clubs are arsenal and barcelona if clubs of that stature are interested in you then you cannot say no
8576571 im certainly open to interest from arsenal and from what i hear feyenoord are happy to hear from them as well
8576572 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test
8576573 the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier
8576574 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8576575 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8576576 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8576577 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in

8576598 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic
8576599 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8576600 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8576601 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money

8576604 but when i came out at 19 i stopped playing for a few years because i wondered how id be received gay football has given me a platform to play the game and meet new friends so its a very positive experience
8576605 some of the gay community feel that football is a straight mans game but that point of view ostracises me because i simply love football
8576606 sometimes i feel that im not part of either the straight football world or the gay community so its fantastic that gay football is building a bridge between these two divides
8576607 its great to see first hand how our match fees are filtering down to projects like inner city football which are having a positive impact on the kids in the area it is important that there are outlets for young people to benefit through organised activities such as todays event
8576608 the aim of our project is to provide weekly football sessions in parks schools and estates to reduce crime in the local area and develop the social skills of participants and provide exit routes into volunteer programmes training and employment opportunities

8576660 we are facing a lot of problems we have run out of supplies at home the relaxation is for a very short time the relaxation is not even in entire region we need to go and get the goods and medicines from other places we are facing a lot of problem
8576661 people have come out of their homes and are making their purchases during this one and half hour curfew relaxation people are stocking up on the food materials there is a lot of problem they should provide relaxation at regular intervals
8576662 after receiving information gathered out of interrogation we have arrested two people namely tanveer and zahir these two were responsible for making arrangements like looking after and guiding those who came from outside to carry out bomb blasts they were also involved in identifying places to implant bombs
8576663 curfew has been imposed in eight town areas where there is disturbance we are asking the executive magistrates and the senior officers who are camping at the block headquarters to impose curfew and i would request the people of all sections of the population to maintain calm in the area
8576664 houses have been burnt our people have run away into the jungle we dont know what is happening it has been three days and we have nothing to eat
8576665 why are we being targeted we dont know anything there is nobody to help us nobody has come to help us till now all our belongings have been burnt
8576666 after the project is completed the concerned bank national horticulture board along with the team of the cultivator will inspect the work after that the board grants 20 per cent subsidy after this the state governments work begins after inspecting the work we provide 20 per cent matching grant to the cultivator in this way a cultivator gets 40 per cent redemption in the total cost borne
8576667 we benefit a lot from this scheme most of the time we were not reaping much profit but because of governments subsidized rates we have benefited a lot and are reaping profits even from the flowers
8576668 at our studio and allied outlets we have over a lakh of ganeha idols they are from one inch tiny idols to 60 feet high ganesha our responsibility lies till we hand over the idol to the customer after which he has to safely ferry it home
8576669 we have 300 to 400 designs for the customers to choose we have theme based idols too like the ones in the past when we had one on kargil conflict last year there was one idol of fatima baby the child from pakistan who underwent a complicated heart surgery here in bangalore this year there is the theme on firing on farmers who were agitating over the supply of fertilisers
8576670 we have been catering to the needs of buyer devotees from the usa and uk and europe we send the idols from here to mangalore port from where the idols are shipped the idols for foreign buyers may range from six inches to seven feet at the most the tiny idols are sold for rupees 60 to 70 an agent buys them in bulk nearly three months ahead of the festival and ships them
8576671 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 percent less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them
8576672 so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8576673 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8576674 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8576675 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive
8576676 in addition to talking about avoiding transmission health communication efforts should promote testing as well

8576696 we are thankful for your understanding and an objective assessment of russias peacemaking efforts
8576697 we are sure that the position of sco members will get an appropriate international response i hope it will serve as a serious signal for those who try to justify the bloody adventure of the georgian leadership

8576701 most of our patients who come in as trauma patients have been exposed to either a blast injury from an ied improvised explosive device or some other explosive event or a penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds or shrapnel or rpgs rocket propelled grenades or things like that
8576702 so we see amputations of arms and legs we see penetrating trauma to the belly or the chest and because we are also the neurosurgical capability for all of rc regional command south we see a lot of head trauma here as well and that again is also blunt trauma blast trauma as well as penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds
8576703 for the month of july for all of the reporting facilities we had the highest number of casualties coming in to our facility
8576704 there are increased numbers of afghan national army and afghan national police casualties which would from my perspective be attributable to their increased role in operations
8576705 i have a hard time saying there is any success or anything positive related to casualties but i would say its attributable to the fact that they the afghans are doing their job better they are going places they never would have gone before and taking a lead role that they would not have taken before

8576728 it appears the administration was deliberately acting in an arbitrary way to muzzle the freedom of press and keep people of the valley in dark about the happenings
8576729 the only source of information at the moment is state run doordarshan and radio which obviously tows the government line
8576730 he even stopped talking and was immediately rushed to amri where he was admitted at the iccu his situation had become worse he is still critical and undergoing treatment however he has been shifted from iccu but is under observation

8576744 die bundesregierung leistet mit ihrer qualifizierungsinitiative einen wichtigen beitrag f r den lehrstellenmarkt
8576745 ziel ist es insbesondere den altbewerbern den einstieg in die berufliche bildung zu erm glichen
8576746 dabei handelt es sich bei ihnen um reine dienstleistungsunternehmen die im rahmen der bestehenden gesetze patentrechte zumeist f r diejenigen durchsetzen die dazu selbst nicht in der lage sind
8576747 es bleibt die entscheidende frage wem die trolle schaden zuf gen bzw f r wen die haie gef hrlich sind
8576748 gro e finanzstarke unternehmen die sich kostenintensive patente leisten k nnen lassen die weniger gut betuchte konkurrenz quasi am ausgestreckten arm verhungern
8576749 konzerne k nnen ihre eigenen patente nicht effektiv als drohpotenzial gegen patentverwerter einsetzen da das verwertungsunternehmen keine eigene produktion aufweist
8576750 im grunde ist unser angebot eine dienstleistung wie jede andere auf dem freien markt
8576751 gro konzerne verlieren so ihre machtstellung sie m ssen bef rchten dass wettbewerber ihre patente an verwertungsunternehmen verkaufen und sie pl tzlich mit lizenzforderungen konfrontiert werden
8576752 die ihre verwertungsaktivit ten optimieren und ausbauen wollen und daf r externe dienstleistungen ber patent und verwertungsagenturen in anspruch nehmen wollen
8576753 sie sollten patentverletzer konsequent verfolgen und anspr che auf unterlassung schadensersatz auskunft und gegebenenfalls vernichtung gerichtlich geltend machen
8576754 der handel mit patenten zu deren professioneller verwertung scheint f r die gro industrie bedrohlich bietet den erfindern bzw patentinhabern die mit einer patentverletzung konfrontiert sind jedoch oft die einzige chance
8576755 nur mit unserer hilfe k nnen patentinhaber und erfinder ber lizenzvertr ge wirtschaftlich von ihren patenten profitieren

8576774 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter
8576775 blogs are ranked as a whole the post pages are not ranked in google so what counts is the home page not the post links
8576776 there is no relief or rescue work going on and we have not received any help we are suffering and there is no end to the suffering
8576777 the government has not even arranged for boats we have to swim to the fields harvest crops and sell them for half the price
8576778 for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections from export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana and actaeon and diana and callisto might be sold
8576779 now the paintings have been offered on remarkably advantageous terms their acquisition by both institutions would be an historic event

8576781 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel
8576782 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8576783 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another
8576784 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible social injustice is killing people on a grand scale

8576787 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8576788 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8576789 over the next five years nr must continue to carry out a full schedule of maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure together with a massive programme of enhancements to increase network capacity
8576790 but work by nr and train operators has shown that it should be possible both to achieve increased efficiency and to reduce disruption to train services by adopting best practice and exploiting technological advances
8576791 we expect the railway to be kept open for business for as much time as is possible and we propose to set nr a target to reduce disruption to passengers by 17 per cent within three years and 37 per cent within five years
8576792 we have been telling the industry for some time that passengers need accurate timely and co ordinated information when engineering works take place
8576793 passengers recognise that engineering works are necessary and will tolerate some short term inconvenience for real long term gain but the rail industry should do more to inform passengers not only of the engineering works but also the benefits the work will bring

8576803 it is a strong protest that starts from naples and hopefully will spread to other cities
8576804 we do not want speculation over pizza prices there are cities like rome and milan where the prices hit 7 8 even 10 euros up to 8

8576806 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals
8576807 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8576808 these results must be understood in context tests show that drug misuse is almost 20 times more common in civilian work places than it is in the navy positive test rates in the navy last year averaged less than 0 4 per cent compared with over 7 per cent in civilian workplaces
8576809 the worst aspect of this scandal is that hms liverpool is supposed to be guarding the falkland islands and such a large drugs bust hardly does wonders for confidence
8576810 the idea of a coked up rating on board a warship with access to such powerful weapons does not bear thinking about this is a total embarrassment for the senior service
8576811 the auction based bidding system makes this a double edged sword as the number of advertisers declines so does the competitive pressure for higher bid prices if advertisers dont step up to the plate and bid more aggressively for placement then its possible that search revenues could stagnate

8576819 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8576820 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8576821 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8576822 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8576823 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center

8576830 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8576831 augusts cbi distributive trades survey makes for pretty grim reading not least because the reported sales balance fell to yet a new record low and the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession
8576832 even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year
8576833 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8576834 there are many benefits to religions from living in a free society but one will not be available namely to forcibly establish a homogeneous culture that follows that religions dictates and none other such imperialism is just what some religions or at least factions of religions insist upon and they will not get it from citizens of a fully free society the faithful who insist on such hegemony will simply not be satisfied if their mission is to coerce everyone to follow their way not just those of the faithful but everyone else they will be rebuffed opposed and if they take action to fulfill their mission they will become criminals

8576862 for their part the haredim do plenty to anger their more moderate co religionists
8576863 so pucker up and kiss the ass that you would kill to kick
8576864 if you could kill with words your weapond be a song but i know for sure that youre not that brilliant
8576865 on monday you should go in and legally change your name to mikesmith
8576866 ultimately its the result which matters most a win is a win is a win huddersfield will quite rightly take the plaudits but well take the result
8576867 i told the lads that even though we swapped things about a little bit if we lost then its because we werent good enough
8576868 you try to warn players that if you go out there psychologically and think that youre a bigger club with better players then it wont happen
8576869 but there are a lot of big clubs gone out already and most of them would like to be in our position
8576870 hes going to wind his players up because he had a fall out with jeremy peace theres no love lost there we have to be prepared for that and try and put a good performance in to try and win
8576871 im not going to go on about injuries because we have to do our best with who is available it is not getting much better though and i hope we will turn the corner sooner rather than later
8576872 were not too far away everyone can see that through how weve been playing
8576873 stoke are interested yes they want to sign him before next monday thats the plan
8576874 it would be a loan with an option for a transfer next summer
8576875 we are out we must concentrate on the scottish cup and the league
8576876 the question wasnt about the penalties but why we didnt win the game before
8576877 if the manager brings someone else in then maybe ill have to look at my future but at the minute im delighted to be a stoke player im happy to be here
8576878 we dominated the game and we shouldve scored a lot more goals but their goalkeeper has made some great saves
8576879 there were a couple of scary moments with corners and set pieces for ayr but weve got through a difficult tie
8576880 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle to keep the matter private
8576881 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8576882 he is still recovering from a metatarsal injury and has done bits of training
8576883 it is quite promising in terms of recovery from the injury but he is still well short of a competitive match
8576884 it is very frustrating sat on the bench week in week out watching games
8576885 i am 21 now and i need to be doing something i want to play
8576886 its no secret the manager knows that and weve had a few chats in pre season about my position and a lot of things have been mentioned like transfers and loans
8576887 i want to be a boro player theres no doubt about that i think we are on the verge of big things here
8576888 a lot has changed over the past year theres been ins and outs and the attitudes have changed
8576889 all the lads have been doing a lot of hard work especially on the movement up front and everyone here is really enjoying the free flowing football we are playing
8576890 it is nice to be involved in such attacking play hopefully against yeovil i showed the manager what i can do
8576891 my preference is to stay here but you never know in football
8576892 jo trained with us it was his first time back with the group and he looked sharp
8576893 we are literally off to a flying start it was amazing to shoot inside a real aircraft we are really excited and raring to go
8576894 knew that the information was confidential at the time disclosure was made that the decisions from which the information was drawn were ordered to be filed confidentially and that by her disclosure she was revealing confidential information to the public
8576895 seeds of peace is the best experience that ever happened to me
8576896 this is the only place that you can be with people from different cultures and countries and talk very honestly
8576897 we thought the weight was off everyones shoulders and now we were just going to work on making the peace happen
8576898 but you know young people have a spirit about them an optimism that just cant be quelled that easily
8576899 for so many of these kids coming here is what it took to hear the other side of the story
8576900 i think that this basic level exposure has a really strong impact on the future
8576901 things dont end after you leave camp actually you have more to do when it finishes

8576937 torner talmente presto che non avrai il tempo di sentire la mia mancanza prenditi cura del mio cuore te lho lasciato
8576938 una cosa mi era chiara e la sentivo in fondo allo stomaco al centro delle ossa dalla punta dei capelli alla pianta dei piedi e nel mio petto vuoto chi ama ha il potere di distruggere e io ero stata distrutta sbriciolata

8576947 we now have a government in scotland that opposes the war in iraq and is prepared to say so
8576948 very disappointed and surprised that the snp government could even contemplate endorsing anything like this
8576949 this could be disastrous for the snp if they refuse to address this issue or give some mealy mouthed response like the labour party would have done
8576950 we hope it is ignorance rather than malice that led to this decision if thats the case then there is no obstacle to getting it changed
8576951 the snp and in particular the first minister are recognised as close friends within the muslim community
8576952 the contract was negotiated and agreed by the general register office for scotland who could not take unproven allegations into account during the procurement process

8576957 the migration at the agencies in which mampu has assisted have had positive results

8576959 some have been involved since 2003 with little information shared publicly so it seems as if suddenly people are finding out that entire states are moving to open source

8576968 the uk housing market downturn seems to be gathering pace which delivers a further blow to consumer spending as the wealth accumulation from the housing market dries up
8576969 we saw a wealth of hawkish comments from the ecb yesterday and that has done something to scotch some of the near term expectations for rate cuts people are suddenly realizing that they may have become overly excited about a rate cut

8577182 and what were seeing is the washthrough of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the liberals
8577183 our practical plan is to see the economy through in the long term and that means making some tough decisions to do that

8577231 we were blessed against all odds by good weather which contributed to the large and enthusiastic turnout of all ages
8577232 everyones generosity on the day contributed towards our fighting fund to stop the proposed wind farm consisting of 15 410ft high turbines and substation in the chilla valley incorporating the moors of chilla graddon odham and hollow
8577233 a film show provided information on the construction and operations of such industrial windfarm developments there was also a presentation of rare flora and fauna to be found in the area and a guide on how people could volunteer to help gather valuable information on local wildlife
8577234 we have much heart warming community spirit and long may it continue
8577235 we have completed our environmental studies and submitted results of those to the local authorities as part of the permit process
8577236 the province has shown it is not capable of mitigating adverse effects on the marsh
8577237 the fact they have been trying unsuccessfully for three years to install a new aboiteau adjacent to the john lusby marsh proves this
8577238 gets as upset as anybody when there is a collision
8577239 it was extremely aggressive behaviour from the two eagles it was something we had not seen before
8577240 done a lot of good work to minimise eagle strikes
8577241 but every death of an endangered species is one step closer to the extinction of that species
8577242 and ensure the public are informed of the outcome of that investigation including what is being done to reduce eagle mortalities at woolnorth
8577243 but i definitely think this is something worth checking into wind energy is here and i think its here to stay
8577244 they were hearing it for the first time but they seemed interested
8577245 this isnt a new idea in some parts of the planet it may not be that well known here yet but many countries use wind energy as the backbone to their urban energy needs it exists and it works
8577246 the idea that a community has the technical expertise to do this would be very attractive
8577247 there is a lot to be done of course this isnt something that could happen overnight but its definitely worth looking in to
8577248 just because its green doesnt mean it doesnt have impacts
8577249 we see the green energy future as very important and something we want to see sooner rather than later
8577250 we would work with them to help strategize toward conservation to really build these things smart
8577251 iconic landscapes and public lands of the west are really important for recreation and the integrity of the western landscape that we have known and loved
8577252 there is a balance between renewable energy and making sure that the places we go hike and backpack are still intact
8577253 you dont want to be at the end of 10 years of environmental lawsuits
8577254 the neat thing about the environmental lobby when it comes to renewable energy is that they get it
8577255 at least what weve heard from them is that there is a balance to be struck between development and mitigating impacts
8577256 is they are not just trying to tap into a good and ready market but are people who are genuinely interested in helping the environment
8577257 encourage people who think that there is a vast blank space out there to look more closely
8577258 this is a solid agreement and i recommend it without hesitation
8577259 one of the primary goals of the road agreement is to minimize adverse affects of the construction traffic on the normal agricultural traffic
8577260 the road agreement sets a priority of traffic with that priority given first and foremost to emergency response vehicles then to rural mail delivery schools buses and transportation of agriculture commodities and implements
8577261 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8577262 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8577263 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true
8577264 were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8577265 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of us dollars of public funds
8577266 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network
8577267 we are committed to a digital revolution in australia we are committed to a digital education revolution in australia
8577268 its the pathway to the future and were confident in the progress weve made
8577269 earlier this year the shadow minister criticised the timeframes as being unrealistic and dangerously truncated for no apparent reason
8577270 now he criticises the government for taking the time to ensure proponents have the information to prepare robust proposals
8577271 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8577272 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8577273 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8577274 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8577275 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8577276 i assign police to do this task without forcibly dispersing the rally
8577277 we still maintain our goals one all parties have to commit that they will not amend the constitution at all two the government has to quit
8577278 at this moment there are more than 10 000 protesters inside
8577279 the presence of nato forces in afghanistan has not only not helped ensure security but has led to the deaths of innocent people on a regular basis
8577280 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighbouring countries
8577281 this is how they pave the way for political and military influence and unfortunately their unilateral actions are continuing
8577282 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8577283 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8577284 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8577285 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8577286 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8577287 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8577288 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8577289 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8577290 and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8577291 finally it is also worth bearing in mind that a lot of these shareholdings in these companies are actually owned by the pension funds and insurance companies
8577292 so this rather primitive 19th century view of capitalism that some people still have that these companies are somehow still owned by a few very rich individuals is just not true

8577294 brad pitt picks up best actor award at venice film festival
8577295 west down parish council have always vociferously opposed the wind farm and it appears they are now the very first council to be ready with the begging bowl
8577296 why on earth should they get their hands on it when they wont even have any of the turbines on their parish land braunton parish council should get first crack at it
8577297 the money is at present being set up via a trust fund which is a completely separate entity to devon wind power and will be distributed for the good of the local community
8577298 i would like to see the fund have tighter restrictions imposed on it so that it goes to the right recipients
8577299 it should be stricter and more focused perhaps only going to energy saving projects within the local area rather than pointless village halls
8577300 perhaps the money could go to completely kitting braunton out with solar powered street lights but the main point im trying to get across is to let people know about this money im worried the right people arent aware of it
8577301 as a parish council we are very much against the wind farm and have been for the past 20 or so years since its inception but now its been passed so why not see what the funds entail
8577302 west down is the nearest sizeable village and the nearest sizeable population to the turbines so why shouldnt we enquire about the money and at this stage its nothing further than that
8577303 the general opinion of local people is that the proposals are in the completely wrong location
8577304 there are five or six variations of bat in the woods and a large group of starlings maybe up to one million
8577305 we havent received the official application from north cornwall district council yet so we have not been able to take a formal view on the proposal
8577306 community windpower has chosen this area for a variety of reasons it has a strong wind resource and is quite a distance from nearby properties
8577307 we believe this is the best site for us and it has the best resources for wind farm development
8577308 at the meeting on tuesday the councillors drafted a letter with our objections which are many
8577309 they include the fact that the site is on the edge of an area of outstanding natural beauty
8577310 this wind farm is going to spoil an incredibly amazing view in one of the most beautiful areas of north cornwall
8577311 this is not a short process it will be continuing over the next couple of months maybe into next year or even into the new authority
8577312 we have letters from both camps those who are in support of renewable energy and zero carbon and the others who consider that there is a fundamental flaw with wind energy which is a blot on the landscape
8577313 i started my business so that id have freedom but ive never felt more trapped

8577316 now lets see if you can figure out why your schools turn out graduates with zero survival value
8577317 okay it would be pointless to turn out graduates with a high survival value
8577318 because they dont need it primitive people need it sure but not civilized people itd be a waste of time for people to learn how to survive on their own the point is if they had a hundred percent survival value they wouldnt need jobs at all
8577319 the first time you have something you have a lot to learn
8577320 this is the first time we have tried something like this
8577321 im not optimistic or pessimistic about it its a scientific assessment
8577322 what im optimistic about with this project is that the state legislation and regulations will provide it with support
8577323 it was a good days work and nice to complete so many laps
8577324 its the fastest circuit of the year and so we were trying out our low downforce package which went well although it always feels strange to drive with such little downforce on the car the track was also quite green which didnt help but i was happy with the set up work we completed even though we still have a lot to learn
8577325 a solid days work with good reliability we did plenty of laps to give nelson as much running as possible with the car in low downforce trim its always quite a challenge here to set the car up as it is such a unique circuit but weve colleted lots of data from the first days running which will give us a good base to work on from here

8577328 while the study continues i was very pleased to hear there is potential for additional onshore wind energy in north lewis in addition the western isles can play a key part in our renewable energy aspirations particularly in the demonstration and deployment of marine renewable
8577329 the key issue is the grid connection without which none of these plans can move ahead
8577330 i am disappointed about the small number of turbines they are talking about i was hoping for a more positive approach for the interconnector
8577331 this one is 60 meters which is just under 200 feet tall
8577332 things will come to a screeching halt if they dont extend the production tax credit
8577333 you have to forge ahead you have to continue to work the projects on a daily basis
8577334 there are too many intricate complex components that have to be completed on timetables and milestones and if those milestones dont get completed and dont get met those projects will never come to fruition
8577335 that means that the wind marketplace right now is going crazy
8577336 its driving the cost of wind turbines through the roof it means that a lot of developers are working day and night trying to get their projects finished so that they can meet that production tax credit deadline
8577337 without the production tax credit were going to see that it will be more difficult for us to be able to bring more wind onto the system because our customers will have to pay more for it
8577338 now we can still do it of course but it will just mean that the price of power will go up
8577339 it will generate about 525 000 in cash back to those local shareholders on an annual basis
8577340 the decision of the board was in error because only a small fraction of my oral presentation was allowed to be given and with many interruptions and our agreement to allow the board to recess to read my written testimony was not fulfilled
8577341 were receiving inquiries from mason county monroe county and other counties we did not think would be indicated based on the wind map
8577342 leave the compensation for the very end because based on all the landowners ive spoken to other things are more important and you need to be comfortable with those first
8577343 in simple terms that the government can take privately owned land as long as the land will be used by the public and the owner is paid a fair price for the land what the amendment calls just
8577344 local government in the region needs to come up with ways to provide communities with certainty
8577345 there were differences of views about the merits of wind farms in different councils
8577346 the issue of wind farms has come along really quickly
8577347 inquiries dont always translate into things happening a very small percentage of them end up being applications or proposals
8577348 thats the call its why cant local government work together to come up with some solutions
8577349 grand succ s de lalbum de la premi re dame de france
8577350 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements
8577351 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8577352 one comment from the meeting was that journalists decisively felt they wanted to take a stand
8577353 well make the same demands we have from the beginning that the company negotiates with us on enterprise agreements and to have the guts to inform us properly about the cuts
8577354 the first is the ongoing collective agreement to discuss the failure of the company to make a decent offer on that
8577355 and secondly its driven by this really deep frustration at the failure of the company to clearly articulate the strategy it has to continue to produce quality newspapers magazines and websites with significantly fewer staff
8577356 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8577357 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8577358 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8577359 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected
8577360 we have lost the appeal that means he will be extradited it will probably be within the next fortnight
8577361 he is absolutely devastated by the decision he and his family are distraught they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8577362 this was their last chance we are going to write to the secretary of state and ask her to reconsider it again
8577363 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8577364 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8577365 well make the same demands we have from the beginning that the company negotiates with us on enterprise agreements and to have the guts to inform us properly about the cuts
8577366 the last i heard there was no stop work activity
8577367 it is work as usual obviously we support the actions of the meaa we will continue to monitor the situation but at this stage things are proceeding normally
8577368 publishing arrangements are in place and we anticipate all our newspapers will be published as normal over this period
8577369 people are worried about their futures and if they are going to have a job in a few weeks time
8577370 they believe the new management team that has come in since the merger with rural press is all about low cost and low quality journalism
8577371 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana

8577376 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8577377 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8577378 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century
8577379 the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons
8577380 and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8577381 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8577382 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8577383 now he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8577384 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8577385 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first

8577389 at the february 2007 meeting council granted development consent to the establishment of those wind monitoring site
8577390 since then there has been continuing consultation regarding this project including roads environment employment noise and visual issues tourism vantages development application requirements and accessing local trades and facilities for the development and housing of employees
8577391 in june this year council approved two additional wind monitoring sites
8577392 wind farms in scenic areas particularly the coastal areas are regarded as damaging to the landscape
8577393 however in agricultural areas of low scenic quality wind farms seem to beautify the otherwise mediocre surroundings

8577403 we have worked with petrosun before and believe that they will continue to enhance our brands and provide excellent service to our retail customers
8577404 im stunned and surprised its absolutely brilliant news i wasnt really aware i was in the frame and it is a surprise but obviously it is a very nice one
8577405 the chance of linking up with the squad for a game at wembley is certainly something to look forward to
8577406 i have not been involved with any of the england teams before i think i was close to turning out for the u19s but missed out with injury
8577407 its certainly a good progression for me which is what its all about as a professional its going to be a great experience
8577408 there are some top players in that squad just meeting up and training with them will benefit me its also good that kights is there as well
8577409 im not really thinking too much about whether ill get a chance or not at this stage im still new to the squad and its still sinking in
8577410 but ill certainly be doing my best when i join up ive not played at wembley before so if i do feature at any stage that will just add to the experience
8577411 reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8577412 despite the difficult economic environment we remain focused on long term value creation and continue to invest in the future of the company
8577413 inflation is squeezing disposable incomes and the outlook for consumer spending and for retailers is gloomy
8577414 the weakness in the u s economy is expected to continue to drag down hong kongs export performance
8577415 stayed in a good shape virtually unscathed by the global credit market turbulence
8577416 you either do something about it or you stick your head in the sand
8577417 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8577418 some research that didnt require sophisticated computer technology and the like took place immediately
8577419 we see no justification for the market to be relocated at this time
8577420 we believe that these changes are for the benefit of the town centre as a whole
8577421 i think we should take part notice of what the objectors have said however i have been supporting this market for many many years and i believe the plans we see here are the best way of ensuring long term survival

8577492 science fiction has often relied on matter and antimatter annihilating each other as a power source with current technology producing anti matter is prohibitively expensive and most view this as the biggest hurdle for these types of power plants basic physics may provide another significant hurdle however physical review focus reports that upon reanalyzing data from 12 years ago an italian team discovered that contrary to popular belief antimatter and matter may bounce off each other before theyre annihilated original paper subscription required the key to this discovery was the annihilation events in their data were clustered into two groups the first group occurred when the antiprotons interacted with the helium in their apparatus and the second set of events up to 25 of the total number occurred at a later time they determined this second set occurred because the antiprotons were reflected off of the back wall of their device to be later annihilated by the helium atmosphere instead of either annihilating the aluminum in the walls or passing through entirely this effect is called rutherford scattering and at the speeds they were working with 1 10 kev or 0 14 0 46 of c the antiprotons are more likely to find themselves scattered by the aluminum nuclei than they are to annihilate the nuclei at lower speeds 500 ev or 0 10 of c this effect may peak with 50 of the antiprotons that make it to the back wall being reflected by it

8577626 with his unquestioned popularity and performance over the years clark kellogg earned all rights to this top spot
8577627 like billy packer al mcguire or any of the most highly regarded broadcasters clark is an original voice with his own style and perspective
8577628 billy packer has set the standard of excellence for over 30 years
8577629 i cant express how important he has been not only to cbs sports and its coverage of college basketball but also to the growth of this great sport it is almost impossible to overestimate his passion knowledge and commitment to the game
8577630 he is the ultimate curator protecting the integrity of the sport fans dont realize they owe billy a thank you
8577631 its something ive been working on for about a year
8577632 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel
8577633 we lifted the head to make the pony more proud tipped the neck into the wind to give it a feeling of greater speed and better balance
8577634 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8577635 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8577636 were very much concerned with detail and precision in our cars at ford and that includes the art we do
8577637 we want our mustang pony badge to be as good as the rest of the car
8577638 con is the best bartender i know in north beach

8577640 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his vp pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers
8577641 by working with pro formance to conduct validation testing ford is proving that eco driving techniques are teachable and work across a broad spectrum of vehicles and drivers
8577642 its a great initiative for ford to lead in this country its not the end all solution for america to obtain energy independence but it is an important part of it
8577643 we are talking with fleet owners first because they have large numbers of vehicles and drivers that could realize significant benefit from such training
8577644 ultimately all drivers can benefit from practicing eco driving and one day it may be considered mandatory as part of all new drivers training
8577645 improving fuel economy requires commitment from all stakeholders including automakers regulators fuel producers and consumers ford will continue to do its part to improve fuel economy with new technologies across its vehicle lineup
8577646 as part of our fuel efficiency strategy we strongly encourage our customers to put eco driving tips into practice
8577647 general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall
8577648 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
8577649 these republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me or my wife or on my sons no not content with that they now include my little dog fala well of course i dont resent attacks and my family doesnt resent attacks but fala does resent them you know fala is scotch and his scotch soul was furious he has not been the same dog since
8577650 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8577651 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8577652 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8577653 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8577654 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8577655 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8577656 grew up well polished by gentlemanly pursuits he would ride to the hounds drive fast fly airplanes he knew good clothes fine horses the newest dance steps
8577657 he pissed away his fortune and joe and his siblings grew up in a decidedly and proudly working class catholic home
8577658 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8577659 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8577660 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8577661 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8577662 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8577663 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8577664 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8577665 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8577666 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8577667 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8577668 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8577669 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue
8577670 in a fast moving and changing world a sleepy or steadfast contentment with the status quo can create disaster literally disaster
8577671 very very smart people can be astonishingly complacent in the face of needed change

8577689 today is a very happy day for all afghans because one of our afghan champions won a bronze medal in the beijing olympics
8577690 we feel very happy that an afghan athlete managed to bring victory to his country
8577691 we are a serious team who respect spanish football and we would want others to treat us the same way
8577692 i am sending a message to the world of football valencia will not be intimidated by any club and even less by those that dont come to you directly and tell things straight
8577693 we didnt want to play any dirty tricks on a colleague paying the buy out clause on a player at a club like villarreal isnt our style with six or seven days to go to the end of the transfer window
8577694 we could have done it and the player would be here i spoke with the villarreal president and he told me they didnt want to sell and there it was left
8577695 i dont understand their anger soriano told me it would have to be a very large bid and as a result i said we would not be interested and thats it
8577696 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8577697 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8577698 we felt like a year ago at this time missouri was a great football team but it might be later in the year before everyone else realized how good they were
8577699 anytime you have a great quarterback like chase daniel we knew he potentially was a great player but he didnt even come onto the scene until our game
8577700 i said after the game last year what a great team illinois was and they ended up in the rose bowl
8577701 the first game you want to start to see the personality of your team i like what ive seen but until youre in competition out on the field by yourself into the moment and having to deal with three and a half hours of football until you see it you dont really know how do you come out of halftime whats your attitude throughout the game what kind of toughness to you play with you want to see what kind of makeup they have
8577702 i have a few more gray hairs than when i started
8577703 with marcell jansen together with the transfer of alex silva we are continuing our path of securing highly ambitious players with great prospects

8577709 i can understand why the fans and the media wouldnt know what to expect because in some respects the coaches dont either
8577710 we would know a lot more because weve been around practice i dont want to say were going into this thing totally blind because were not weve been practicing for several weeks now
8577711 but until you put them in a game situation youre not certain how guys are going to react particularly the guys that have not played not just the freshmen but there are some sophomores and upperclassmen that are just now getting their first opportunity to play significant amounts
8577712 i would think both have gotten to the point where we feel comfortable we could win with both of them
8577713 he has an instinct to run to daylight fast thats a good running back instinct so it makes him a little bit like a running back because hes able to get up to speed fast hes an explosive runner for a guy who is 6 6 like the guys weve seen in the olympics
8577714 you got to deal with the cards youre dealt weve had one year starters at other positions its just the quarterback obviously gets a lot of attention allan evridge has done the most to earn this right to start and thats where hes going to be
8577715 this is the last go around for many of us many of us werent part of a bowl game and weve not won a bowl game around here since 1949 so we the seniors are pulling from the top and getting guys to go in the same direction were going to win a lot of games this year
8577716 as far as our commitment is concerned obviously basketball was a key component to this
8577717 were going to triple our games that are available on espn and espn2 were going to add a regular game on espnu were going to have a regular season game on espn on abc the conference tournament semifinals and championship obviously on espn and abc as well
8577718 so were very excited about boosting distribution and exposure for sec basketball
8577719 i think it really speaks highly of the people in the conference office and their vision and diligence toward getting something done that obviously is monumental for our league
8577720 i am very excited and look forward to being part of the best tv package in college sports by far
8577721 i never worried about it some guys in our league the pac 10 complained about the tv deal
8577722 this thing is all based off recruiting you look at all of the first round picks out of the pac 10 this year those kids thought it was a pretty good league
8577723 to see the soldiers in that setting and gain some insight and understanding into what they go through makes our jobs seem like gravy we think we have problems with recruiting and scheduling and its nothing compared to what those guys go through and they keep such a positive attitude
8577724 im going to petition the ncaa to see if the five wins over there can count on my schedule
8577725 two of them were from texas and said they were going to try to come see my team play
8577726 i would not be surprised if all three played at certain times
8577727 the great thing about our new quarterback is that we have a veteran offense around him with receivers who know where theyre supposed to be a veteran offensive line that can give him some protection and guidance and veteran backs that can carry the football were going to ask him to do the things that we need from the quarterback spot but not to do anything that theyre not capable of doing
8577728 what im looking for is leadership a guy that can control the football team and who guys will look up to
8577729 and if thats both of them then itll be both of them but i think it will eventually work its way out we have two good guys that are so close and sometimes when you have a quarterback battle with two people a lot of people say you must not have one and i think this is totally different both these guys have earned the right to play some
8577730 theres more chemistry and i guess unselfishness this year than there was even two years ago when we won the national championship we might not have the talent that we had two years ago but well be much more unselfish close and together thats whats going to bring us over the hump thats where we werent last year not enough guys had played there wasnt the experience we didnt have the same camaraderie as we do now
8577731 the fans expect us to win the national championship now but i think thats a little unrealistic at this point
8577732 michigan made a lot of mistakes on offense that threw off the whole offense but at one point they were rolling then they kind of let up off of them and appalachian state never stopped their motors never stopped they were hungry so if we get up by a touchdown or five touchdowns weve got to keep pounding them
8577733 we didnt have many guys last year but those guys stayed together from spring camp through the season this year weve juggled them around more than we did all last year put together
8577734 you have to be able to adjust our game plan has a lot of adjustment in it were going to try and be as flexible as we can without confusing our kids there are a lot of unknowns youve got a quarterback starting that you have to go back and look at san diego state film or junior college film to see him you have to look at several different teams to see what you think theyre going to be doing offensively and then you have to look at ucla film to see the personnel its a little bit different but regardless of what the situation is you have to be ready to play

8577757 im the same guy as a head coach as i was an assistant im not going to get all hyped up and charge out of that helmet and trip and fall and embarrass myself
8577758 hes probably our most valuable player outside of patrick white hes a backup running back the starting slot hes a kick returner he has a great head on shoulders he could probably go in there and play quarterback were going to do more than throw bubble screens to him were going to try to get the ball to him downfield were going to get the ball to jock sanders somehow hes going to be exciting
8577759 that wasnt a very good night thats for sure that was a long night

8577790 embed human rights in the nhs constitution and put them at the heart of its plans for reform of health and social care regulation
8577791 failing to meet basic rights is not acceptable no one should have to go without help with eating and drinking or using the toilet yet this is still happening every day in hospitals and care homes its horrendous that people are still being mistreated and abused
8577792 human rights are not visible enough in government policy and are even more difficult to see in practice despite the excellent care provided by many health and care workers there is much work to be done to change the culture of health and social care
8577793 without a commitment from policy makers and staff to uphold peoples human rights we cannot be confident our loved ones will be treated with dignity or respect
8577794 we are doing everything in our power to protect vulnerable older people and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect in all care settings no one especially not elderly people should have to put up with abuse or ill treatment
8577795 earlier this year we amended the health and social care bill so that any independent sector care home that provides accommodation together with nursing or personal care on behalf of a local authority is subject to the human rights act
8577796 this is only part of a wide ranging package of measures being put in place we are also extending our first ever dignity in care campaign creating the first ever national dementia strategy and reviewing the no secrets guidance on protecting older people from abuse
8577797 thats my nature our defensive staff was talking about that thats our nature and we are going to prepare as hard for this game as any game we play
8577798 really the first game is always the toughest because youre not sure where youre at and youve been going against your own offense in camp i think there is a little bit of uncertainty because youre not sure how good you are so the first game always creates a little bit of uncertainty
8577799 i dont know his brother at all but our coach heacock obviously won the frank broyles award last year for the best assistant coach in the nation and he was truly deserving
8577800 he does all the little things and he really wants our defense as a whole to be great he has a passion for it
8577801 anybody can beat you on any day we all know that from last year
8577802 if you take anybody the least bit lightly its going to be a long day
8577803 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8577804 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our in the united states
8577805 im sure theres some anxiety because guys want to be here and theyve worked hard
8577806 there are a lot of guys w ho have earned the right to be a part of this team but you can only keep so many guys
8577807 theres going to be a lot of competitiveness and its going to be a big night for a lot of these guys there are some battles being waged
8577808 to me the chemistry is always the same and whatever some guys are going through theyre doing a good job at hiding it
8577809 theres a sense of urgency on some guys part but the y do a good job of just playing football its always in the back of your mind but thats where it needs to be
8577810 i aint going to say its a showcase but you had better show the coaches you know what youre doing
8577811 you want to show them that you can play the game
8577812 i want to show them that i can be more physical because one of the knocks on me was that i need to be a more physical guy
8577813 ive got to show them that i can play big and i deserve to be a part of this organization they picked me so i need to show them that they made a good decision
8577814 oil markets are waiting for gustav and waiting to go on holiday

8577824 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8577825 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8577826 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8577827 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8577828 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country
8577829 the way in which heathgate resources manages mining fluids and the disposal of liquid wastes has been confirmed by the csiro and geoscience australia as worlds best practice and endorsed by the chief scientist mr garrett said
8577830 there really is something about the intrinsic nature of places which can influence happiness and wellbeing
8577831 the environment lack of green spaces air and noise pollution crime rates all of these influence happiness
8577832 we post our school bus runs on the district website and it has been up in running for a few weeks
8577833 parents can find all that information there based on their street or school
8577834 the best advice i would tell them on that first morning is to be patient
8577835 the kindergarten students arent used to getting on the bus so usually what takes around 20 to 30 seconds might take two to three minutes
8577836 we always ask that every student be at their bus stop five minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive
8577837 it takes a long time for a bus to stop so make sure children know that this is not a motorcycle or small car that can stop very fast
8577838 es existiert immer noch eine relativ gro e l cke zwischen china und den besten der welt in den popul ren sportarten wie leichtathletik schwimmen und radfahren sowie bei den attraktiven ballspielen

8577841 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8577842 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8577843 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8577844 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8577845 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8577846 im pleased that high standards continue to be maintained but i want to see year on year improvements like teachers across the country i have high expectations for all children
8577847 there are no quick fixes but more can be done especially for children who are really struggling with basic literacy and numeracy and for those children who with a bit of help could reach the next level up
8577848 a recent report found that there is a clear relationship between results at the foundation stage and later ks1 attainment in communication language and literacy
8577849 progress in tackling the problem of poor literacy and numeracy among our youngest children has stalled
8577850 children who dont master basic skills at an early age risk falling even further behind in primary and secondary school
8577851 there must be a much greater focus on early identification of these problems and more one to one support for children with basic literacy and numeracy problems
8577852 last years figures show that that the link between poverty and under achievement is already evident at this early age they confirm the need for the liberal democrat pupil premium to target extra money at disadvantaged pupils
8577853 i am very pleased to see another set of positive results
8577854 the rise in performance across the key stages once again highlights that wales is making positive progress under our revised assessment arrangements
8577855 our focus is very much on consolidating progress made to date and building on it for the future the new skills based curriculum implementation of the foundation phase and developments at 14 to 19 will all help to ensure that our achievements are sustained and developed in the future

8577859 the bishop is denying his permission for the dogs wedding
8577860 when the regimental first sergeant delivered the used sacred vessels hes reported that the bishop asked when hed be getting the rest of the payoff the rfs did a double take the bishop explained he expected all of the assets the children brought to vermont to be turned over to the church as their recovered property as recovered by their students
8577861 rfs reported the conversation to me and i had him log it with the mps as an affidavit and then called navy
8577862 i spoke to the rfs and he repeated the story to me verbatim i called my dad he called the jag the jag called the chief justice its everyones considered opinion that you call the bishop to the woodshed and make the problem go away
8577863 did any of the esteemed legal minds think the bishop had a case
8577864 no but he can stop the wedding he can make trouble hes unlikely to prevail but we dont have time to fight it out
8577865 hes obviously exceeding the bounds of his office and he may even be interfering in the legitimate duties of an intelligence officer
8577866 sergeant lets see if his grace plays poker prepare the white red and green forms naming the bishop personally have them on my desk in an hour call my driver
8577867 yes lieutenant you know who i am yes authentication seven able six zulu wake up the top cop have him take a detail and arrest the bishop of bennington now bring him to my office for questioning possible arraignment and possible subsequent detention under a carte rouge that i will sign tell him to be gentle but not too gentle and to follow procedure with the irons questions

8577870 silence im considering the evidence that has been presented against you
8577871 not in an intelligence hearing you have only my sense of fair play and what is in the best interest of the people of the state of vermont to protect you now silence or ill sign the red and white and i can go back to bed you sir will be on a fast ride to hell

8577873 now i know what a mommy cow really feels like
8577874 better than when you get help with conception that turkey baster is like a coke bottle
8577875 dont mind whore hey hes not at all interested in you but he is a cracker jack designer fitter and sewer
8577876 i agree and for your john hed be turned on if you came in a burlap sack
8577877 ok put on grace kelly and let jorge and the rest of the gals tune it up
8577878 no we dont want her to fall out like a slut nor do we want it transformed into a mother hubbard she needs room in the butt to sit down but tight enough to drive the boy wild shes a milker so give us an extra finger in the bust
8577879 yes ive been offered to be the abbott of a congregation in montpelier by my order just like brother prefect its a failing school and ive been given three year contract and a free hand im going to use brother prefects methods with what ive learned and i have been appointed to the governors task force to eliminate the current public school system
8577880 so youre staying in the order and not going to africa
8577881 yes the person who was planning to do that no longer exists brother prefect was absolutely right that person had no business leading a school he may have been too charitable leaving that person in the school at all you classmates have taught me a bit of what is possible even brother prefect wouldnt have believed that all youve done was possible he often said people will surprise you to the upside more than the downside he was right there
8577882 guide i was hoping for guidance im swimming in the deep end
8577883 sergeant do you have to say sir youre a man three times my age with a ton of fruit salad experiences and it is i who should be saying sir to you
8577884 begging your pardon sir but i have faith in the people who gave you that designation that 1 youll be earning it and 2 you have kills i know i dont have im proud to be serving with you because i know the content of your character so lets observe the formalities and focus on the mission my mission today is to get you gents in inspection order and between you and me the admirals daughter is a far more demanding inspector than any gunnie and i for one dont plan to get on her bad side by disappointing her so with all due respect you sluggards have to get the lead out and come this way sirs
8577885 the man needs to see you for a few minutes when hes free
8577886 your grace i understand that there is a problem with your church and the marriage of a pair of my officers
8577887 colonel be serious these are not officers they are children
8577888 your grace these so called children as youve called them have had more combat experience that most of my officers theyve killed more bravo golfs on the opp for than some of my men they have done more to make vermont safer than most everybody i didnt propose nor did command approve making the officers out of sentimentality or stupidity they will make more of a contribution to the common defense then you ever have or will so you have no standing to judge if they should be officers or their performance as officers you sir dont have that right nor that responsibility and if the circumstances were different that statement alone would be enough to induce me to put down my badge of office and demand personal satisfaction for insulting my brother officers times dont permit me that luxury even today i have to order men to go and perhaps die for vermont you sir will not impugn my officers id tread carefully here this is not some church convention where your opinion has weight this is an arraignment to see if the state of vermont needs protection from you
8577889 now getting down to business i have an affidavit here sworn by two men under the usual penalty of perjury and at risk the new risk of a demand for satisfaction that you sir during the delivery of certain used sacred gold articles recovered from new york ranted that all of the convoys material was yours further it is alleged that you demanded that all the convoy be delivered to you personally for disposition and i quote from the affidavit i dont care what the laws say its mine because it comes from them surviving in church property im the churchs representative its mine i dont care what the vermont law says ill make everyones lives miserable until i get it then later the affidavit states if those brats dont give me the convoy theyll never set foot in a catholic church again ill see they are excommunicated they will get away with this over my dead body your grace surely you must see the irony in this situation
8577890 normally i could care less what you and your church does but this concerns my officers your disparagement of the people of vermont their laws and their faith in you as a church leader certainly puts you firmly on my radar you seem to be making this about money not church rules about suitability banns and the age of consent yes the man who signed accepting the affidavit is catholic and was horrified the jag is catholic and sits on your chancery court he briefed me on the cannons you should be operating under so lets shift to my area the civil authority i have to protect the people of vermont sir deliberately dropping the religious title it appears you have committed extortion attempted theft by deception and attempted facilitation of bribery of a serving commissioned officer add to that two counts of interference in a criminal investigation and a few counts of disparaging an officer in performance of his duty you have quite a load of explaining to do
8577891 sir this is your court the people of vermont will demand satisfaction they trusted you by accepting you into high church office in that office you did these things that violate the laws of all the people of vermont you abused that trust frankly this will never see an open court it would be too damaging in times when the people need no distractions
8577892 oh but sir i can and will i suggest you quickly reconsider retract your ill considered remarks and make ammends everyone is allowed to confess their sins and claim absolution arent they
8577893 no sir i gain nothing personally out of this i get two fine officers who can continue to work for the people of vermont without distraction i promise that this is the most expensive and important decision you make even if i didnt have the carte powers of my office as a civilian id lobby for the religious freedom act removing your tax deduction status id have the ag investigate every decision review every dime you had ever spent id petition rome for an ad lumina visit recalling you for a period of study with the pope and dont think youd be back id lobby to have you declared persona non grata yeah i know you have filed papers as an ambassador from the vatican to put yourself further above the law finally if had to id go door to door trashing you publicly to every catholic in the state do you get a sense of how much sir you disgust me and how easy it would be for me to sign any of these forms do you
8577894 perhaps i was too emotional to overwrought with the joy of recovering these dear sweet children and worried how holy mother church would provide for them in their hour of need brother kevin assured me that while the children were in his care they had been chaste faithful and conducted themselves appropriately i can certainly see the great job that you and others have preparing for them i can see my way clearly now to giving them my blessing
8577895 one more thing perform the ceremony today with a smile then get out of my state
8577896 release the bishop hes recanted the extortion he wants to perform the wedding before he goes on his vacation please guard the bishop ensure his safety that he gets to the wedding on time and that hes not delayed on his trip collect his passport at the border i understand hes going to rome for prayer and wont be back
8577897 no you may not you may only tell me what you see that i am doing something wrong then you may administer it when i need a kick in the a double q dismissed
8577898 the colonels compliments maam he wishes you to know roadblock removed
8577899 that you rfs thats good news that no one else needs to know
8577900 gentlemen i hope that liquor all went on you not in you at ease

8577904 i guess we should hire her to teach this to everyone
8577905 sir yes sir its a great survival situation weapon i made my own in under ten minutes with a small pocket knife
8577906 when you get back report to the red top the regimental first sergeant with a plan to equip and train everyone even the officers but that will take extra classes
8577907 ok men heres how i see it the children exposed that theres an organized bravo golf ring operating to the south somewhere we hell i guessed they are using i95 to move contraband so you guys go down and sit on it you got the kids new encryption scheme
8577908 well dont lose it you see now why we valued these waifs questions
8577909 sir is it true the children invented this in the shelter
8577910 so i am told so i am told scary im glad they are on our side but remember not a whisper about this stuff to anyone if could kill a lot of innocent people just as sure if we handed the bravo golfs a fifty

8577912 general goldie so nice of your to call on me you could have summoned and id have come to you
8577913 general i assume youre acting and putting your scouts out i invited our new friend and ally chief simon shortgrass jones and their consuliere the beautiful young ms jill to have a frank discussion
8577914 simon steven and jill what the general has just said was that im on my own here he really doesnt agree did you know he turned down my job threw me under the bus and made me take it so he could stay close to the action dont blame him im going to open vermonts kimono a little im going to tell you stuff and well see if it stays between us and gets actioned appropriately then maybe the general will trust you some more and our mutual kimonos will be opened further the general is responsible for the hottest section of our border he led the recent clean up of your newly acquired tribal lands and you can win him over to your side by keeping the peace on your side if you dont he has my complete support to help if you cant we will have no qualms about replacing you with some one who will we want peace and well kick butt till we get it for our people now with that unpleasantness out of the way let me tell you about our mutual problem
8577915 we know that there is an organized opposition force in the field in the coming days you will hear the terrible things that the refugees endured one is a organized slave market that trafficked in slaves mostly female what you will not hear is that there was an organization behind it we know it survived the classmates blowing up of that market we are placing units in the field to surveil recon collect evidence prisoners or anything that can expose who the big end points are we require you to at least not interfere should they identify themselves to you it would be nice to have your cooperation should they ask for it it would be helpful if you passed along anything that you heard pertaining to this matter it would be good if your enquired of the bravo golfs you encounter if they know anything we have no concern how you extract such information other than it be reliable information extracted by torture in our experience is very unreliable a person in pain will say anything to make it stop we prefer subtler methods that can give confirmation as we become better friends we will share some of those as needed are there any questions
8577916 well for sure wed like to help but you see how will we know them we cant have every dick claiming to be youse guys
8577917 the gentlemen in question will ask for white rose it could be white rose tea or to speak to chief white rose they all have a white rose tattoo on their forearm close examination of the rose shows a petal that looks like vermont since they are very dangerous men id advise your folks get white rose in some form into the conversation perhaps you might have you men chat about reporting to chief white rose for extra duty time off or equipment i am most concerned about friendly fire
8577918 no besides neither i nor anyone really knows exactly this way a spy at our end can not kill them by betrayal
8577919 my dear ms jill spend some time with general armody and youll find hes well known not to trust his own mom im more skeptical then he is
8577920 now ms jill you could be holding my mothers cat hostage to turn her into a double agent so why would i put my mom at risk if its known i dont trust her she useless to anyone even if you threatened to kill her or kill her id just go to the funeral and then move every rock to pay you back
8577921 see daughter these are as i told you very dangerous men good men loyal to the people but none the less dangerous accidents happen to people who arent honest with such men

8577977 we happened to combine injuries with ineffectiveness against a good hitting team
8577978 theyre not going to roll over and just let us win
8577979 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8577980 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8577981 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8577982 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8577983 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8577984 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8577985 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8577986 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear
8577987 i spent 5 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8577988 mccains candidacy is basically a noun a verb and pow

8578057 this was an emergency situation there were frequent reports coming in to the police of looting and of irate residents in affected neighborhoods who were becoming so upset that there was concern that vigilante justice might take place
8578058 therefore the police announced a zero tolerance policy all of these arrests were based upon solid probable cause to believe these people were committing theft
8578059 its an incredible show of faith by nbc and so amazingly nice to get based on the work alone
8578060 this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series

8578065 you know hes there when hes playing but he usually doesnt say too much about it
8578066 seeing him compared against other kids in the northwest hes right there in the mix
8578067 the only difference between him hes got a little size difference than the other kids some of them are 260 270 hes teetering between 295 and 305 any given day i think probably at the collegiate level hed probably go to a guard position and hed be fine there and maybe hed play his first year
8578068 some schools have looked at me but i dont really let it get to my head
8578069 im just looking at the season focusing on the season
8578070 he was the real deal i love getting challenged it makes me work harder too
8578071 we looked at that film and there are times he knocks siddoway down siddoway knocks him down and youre thinking man those two are big time
8578072 there were games in our league where he would single handedly take control of the line of scrimmage
8578073 were a gap control team where he has to step and maintain there was times that he was so quick off the ball he was almost taking handoffs in the backfield for his size hes got an extremely quick first step
8578074 itd be nice on my parents to not make them travel a whole lot
8578075 we knew going into the summer that he was going to be our starting tackle and that was based upon his freshman year
8578076 he was a man amongst boys at the freshman level he was good size there and hes got a good work ethic he just matured faster than the other kids and especially at the freshman level it was a lot more noticeable
8578077 ever since we were little its get the ball and run behind him whenever you get it

8578094 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8578095 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8578096 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8578097 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8578098 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8578099 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8578100 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8578101 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8578102 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8578103 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8578104 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8578105 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue

8578114 managers at bristol had succeeded in reversing the decline we recorded at the last inspection in 2005
8578115 however in spite of these efforts the effects of continued population pressure meant that bristol was not yet performing well enough in three crucial areas safety respect and activity
8578116 bristol is a busy local prison and works hard to provide a safe decent environment
8578117 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the hard work by managers and staff in raising the standards since the last inspection

8578134 t he benefits are most significant when the sup feed covers a large number of other feeds
8578135 sup consumers must be somewhat intelligent when consuming feeds in order to poll at the appropriate frequency but our goal was to make things as simple as possible for sup producers in the hopes that most sites will be able to quickly implement a sup feed
8578136 is a very simple and common data format that is now supported by just about every common language it is also very compact which is a real advantage for sup feeds that may have thousands of entries an xml based sup feed could be easily generated but its not clear that there would be any advantage and it could easly end up being 3 5 times as large

8578175 and the cops if they have that information theyre certainly not sharing
8578176 this information may or may not exist some place in society but its actually easier for me to try to rebuild it from scratch than to try and get it from the authorities who might have it now maybe this will succeed or maybe it will fail the normal case of social software is still failure most of these experiments dont pan out but the ones that do are quite incredible and i hope that this one succeeds obviously but even if it doesnt its illustrated the point already which is that someone working alone with really cheap tools has a reasonable hope of carving out enough of the cognitive surplus enough of the desire to participate enough of the collective goodwill of the citizens to create a resource you couldnt have imagined existing even five years ago
8578177 monies will directly fund these two cooperatives in an effort to fund resources these grants help increase economic stability for poor ginger farmers
8578178 the grants address the concerns equated with africans limited access to world markets also they create the space required by both ssgfcs and magfacos to move up the value chain by starting to process their ginger and increase the marketability of their products

8578183 alahh perempuan melayu pun pakai kebaya takkan awak cina tak boleh
8578184 itu mereka saya lain lagipun tak selesa pakai kebaya di khalayak ramai nampak bentuk badan
8578185 bukan kolot tetapi menjaga aurat baju kebaya yang menampakkan bentuk badan tak menutup aurat bukan mana boleh pakai di khalayak ramai
8578186 tak panaskah mereka tu menutup semua kecuali mata yang kelihatan
8578187 tak tahulah tetapi saya agak mereka tak rasa panas mungkin kain hitam yang mereka pakai tu selesa untuk dipakai dalam cuaca kita yang panas saya tak tahulah sebab saya tak pernah berpurdah belum ada peluang nak cuba
8578188 mereka tu arab oklah itu budaya mereka yang aku tak faham mengapa ada orang kita sendiri yang nak sangat pakai purdah tu nak sangat jadi arab sedangkan diri masih melayu
8578189 eh mengapa awak kata begitu bukankah memakai purdah itu juga sebahagian daripada pemakaian islam
8578190 itu untuk orang arab sebab sana panas dan berdebu mana boleh samakan dengan malaysia ni aku hairan gak mengapa nak tutup semua sehingga nak dengar suara dia pun susah bukankah susah nak makan dan minum kalau berpurdah buat apa menyusahkan diri sendiri sedangkan islam itu mudah
8578191 mungkin bagi awak wanita yang berpurdah itu menyusahkan diri sendiri tetapi bagi dia dia bahagia memakai purdah baginya dia menurut syariat islam kalau dia hanya memakai tudung biasa tanpa menutup wajahnya mungkin ramai lelaki yang akan terpikat dengan kecantikannya sehingga dirinya sendiri tidak tenang lagipun apa yang awak susah hati sangat dengan mereka mereka yang berpurdah itu hak mereka sama ada nak bertudung biasa atau berpurdah
8578192 hak mereka untuk keluar rumah tanpa perlu berpurdah purdah bukan budaya melayu pun memakai baju kurung dan bertudung bukankah dah mencukupi syarat menutup aurat
8578193 benar tetapi awak berat sebelah awak tak adil kepada mereka yang berpurdah
8578194 apa awak ni saya hanya mengatakan wanita melayu islam tidak perlu berpurdah itu aje
8578195 benar tetapi awak lupa satu perkara penting mereka juga ada hak untuk memakai purdah lagipun ia menutup aurat bahkan bagi saya tindakan mereka patut dipuji kerana mereka berpegang kepada prinsip mahu menjaga aurat walaupun bagi sesetengah daripada kita cara pemakaian mereka itu ekstrim mereka yang berpurdah tak mengganggu sesiapa pun dengan cara berpakaian mereka itu sebaliknya awak pula yang memperkecilkan tindakan mereka yang berpurdah dan menutup aurat dengan lengkap sedangkan ramai wanita melayu islam yang sengaja mendedahkan aurat yang memakai baju tak cukup kain atau berseluar jeans ketat tidak pula awak tegur atau kritik saya rasa awak yang bermasalah bukan mereka yang berpurdah
8578196 ya awak tak adil kepada wanita yang memilih untuk memakai purdah awak terima wanita wanita islam yang sengaja mendedahkan rambut mereka juga mereka yang berbaju ketat yang berbaju pendek dan yang berbaju mendedahkan anggota badan yang tidak sepatutnya didedahkan mengikut ajaran islam awak terima semua tu dengan alasan itu hak mereka untuk berpakaian mungkin awak dah biasa melihat keadaan mereka berpakaian begitu maka awak tak rasa ada kejanggalan lagi awak juga tak tegur wanita india yang bersaree atau wanita cina yang bercheongsam ketat dengan alasan mereka berhak memakai pakaian yang mereka suka namun bila tiba tiba awak lihat wanita yang menjaga kehormatan diri dengan memakai purdah awak memperkecilkan tindakan mereka awak ejek awak hina awak tak pula mempertahankan hak mereka itu saya hairan adakah awak faham apakah itu cara penampilan wanita islam yang sebenar mengikut islam

8578333 after a careful review of the whole process nec in session strongly believes that the government has not been sincere and is not committed to a meaningful renegotiation in the present circumstances this indeed is a very sad development

8578416 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8578417 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8578418 and i realised he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8578419 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8578420 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out

8578422 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8578423 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain

8578443 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8578444 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8578445 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8578446 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8578447 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8578448 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8578449 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8578450 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward
8578451 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8578452 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc
8578453 we have studied this in mice but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes
8578454 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress
8578455 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role

8578458 super sluggers succeeds and fails as most mario sports games do its quick arcade style action is easy to get into and plenty fun coming at the expense of the nuances and balance youll find in a sim
8578459 what it lacks in innovation and online play mario super sluggers makes up for with its robust modes fun controls and multiplayer options if youre a fan of either the characters or the sport you owe it to yourself to round these bases
8578460 multiplayer is amusing in that hanging out with your friends is fun anyway but the single player content is truly terrible a series of boring one off challenges punctuated by simplistic exploration and the occasional full game makes up marios quest to foil bowser jr via baseball yes its as insipid as it sounds

8578579 woh hamein marne ke liye bolte the aur chup karne ke liye thapad bhi martay the they threatened to kill us and even slapped us telling us to remain quiet
8578580 we had locked ourselves in the kitchen to escape from the militants but they broke the door and brought us out
8578581 we pleaded with them not to kill us and offered them belongings and cash we asked them to spare as as we have small children they locked all of us except my husband who they kept separately in a room
8578582 it was a very sensitive but successful operation we were able to save the family particularly women and children
8578583 unfortunately we lost three hostages to the bullets of the militants
8578584 they came unscathed from this house of death due to the blessing of the god
8578585 the people of entire colony had prayed for their well being during the operation

8578601 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
8578602 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
8578603 and you know what only you would think of something like this
8578604 oh ive seen pictures of you on myspace and i run a site for the a7x girlfriends or used to when jimmy was dating sandra
8578605 i was wondering since no one knows much about you two if i could get some information about you
8578606 well my name is ashley donalds and im umm 18
8578607 yeah and i think you should be in a picture with her
8578608 okay so were not gonna tell you where were going you just have to see it but melia and i wanted to do this for you guys cause weve been a burden on you all and we wanna make up for it in some way and theres no telling us we havent been the slightest bit of a burden our minds made up
8578609 she said no arguing or im turning this limo around and forgetting about the surprise
8578610 a strip club youre taking us to a strip club
8578611 alright the private area is around the back just go to the bar and ask for dom
8578612 take her but i warn you if you keep it up im attacking you both
8578613 i cant promise to behave myself when theyre acting like this
8578614 if i leave with him now i wont stop him and im not sure hes in the right state of mind to remember that we cant have intercourse
8578615 maybe hell cream himself watching and calm down enough that hell remember
8578616 either get naked or im doing it for you at the hotel
8578617 he promised you he could handle it avoiding him is like saying you dont trust him
8578618 youll be fine now go be with him he deserves it after the way you treated him this morning
8578619 thats what a girl like her wants why else would she work here
8578620 what the hell is wrong with you man shes just a whore shes not worth getting so upset over
8578621 or do you not want to be my girl anymore is that what all this is about that shit with ash
8578622 you know the part where you considered letting your female best friend get you off instead of your boyfriend
8578623 youre scared of me now youre scared to be alone with me melia im the one who decided we shouldnt have intercourse until the cyst ruptures im not going to lose my head over a little girl on girl action no matter how much i enjoyed it nothing could make me cause you pain
8578624 thats what love does to you people always say it makes you lose your mind and go crazy it didnt with me maybe i was already crazy and so its had the opposite effect on me whatever the point is i might would have let my primal urges control me in the past and make me just fuck a girl without consideration of her but i love you and that keeps me steady it makes me put you first always so no matter what i really want to do to you if its not something you want or need i wont do it
8578625 ive done enough crying tonight this was supposed to be fun
8578626 okay it was about you a little but its not only you i didnt trust i didnt trust myself with you every time youre around
8578627 you cant possibly know what you do to me with something as simple as a look or a smile
8578628 i was afraid that i would beg you to fuck me and you wouldnt stop because i was pleading with you and you always give me what i want
8578629 this time im just going to have to give you what you need

8578632 i was disappointed the way we played we had our opportunities
8578633 our one day cricket hasnt been consistent especially the overall performances with the bat
8578634 if you are not capable of getting the runs its quite difficult to win matches
8578635 that is something we really have to work with our guys need the confidence to go out there and express themselves which we have asked them to do
8578636 but they havent been consistent we definitely need to work hard and make sure we get it right because this is our future
8578637 especially with the injuries weve had guys who put up their hands and performed thilan thushara has been outstanding with ball and bat so was nuwan kulasekera
8578638 we just need to make sure our batting is consistent
8578639 at the start of the series i said in one day cricket you need to be very consistent with the bat putting runs on the board or chasing down targets we have to do it thats where we lost the series
8578640 we do have some cricket in the near future so its important that we finish on a high note
8578641 we played some really good cricket throughout the test series and one day series it will be disappointing if you just give up on the next game
8578642 the advance booking for dhaam dhoom is very good seeing the booking we have given 22 shows for the film let us hope that the film is liked by everybody as the industry needs a hit badly
8578643 this is the first time ever a jayam ravis movie will be releasing with more than 200 prints worldwide the reason being said is the movie has come out really good with a class and style the background score by harris jayaraj and picturization is said to be mind blowing above all it is a clean family entertainer even the strict malaysian censors have cleared it with an u certificate

8578664 at first tufts wanted to give us a tiny increase so some of us sat down with roberto and made it clear the reason we werent ready to sign the contract yet was full time work
8578665 then they said oh we can give you 90 percent now
8578666 but that is not unusual as most costs rise annually
8578667 if it werent for the students the work of the janitors wouldnt have been as valued as it was in the negotiations they helped frame what this was all really about
8578668 we respect the rights of our students to express their views on this subject
8578669 we want to bring janitors and students at tufts together to make a stronger community between the two groups
8578670 at most colleges the janitors are kind of invisible people so we want to change that

8578684 it started really big there was a long queue of people trying the coffee buns
8578685 it might be also because we are selling a different concept altogether were selling an ultra niche kind of product selling only one product in the mall
8578686 the open kitchen concept is true to all roti mums it is very important that people can understand and people can see how their food is prepared

8578688 basically the ship received conflicting information on when it was supposed to arrive in the suez canal

8578690 we would like to express our sincere apology and profound sorrow for this tragic accident and extend our deepest sympathy to the family of mr mohammed afifi
8578691 we have offered financial assistance to the family realising of course that no amount of money could ever compensate his family for the loss of life

8578707 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8578708 was performed as only the master showman could envision actors wearing
8578709 thus at this critical point in negotiations a man who knew almost nothing of the background of the situation and had never met with jack or the modocs was placed in charge of the job of getting jack to leave lost river it is to be granted that meacham was not a strong agent and that he had shamefully neglected his duty and opportunity to pacify the modocs
8578710 the only peace offered them was the peace of submission as each location that the modocs would accept was rejected by canby it became increasingly clear that the only reservation for them would be that they would share with the unfriendly klamath and that had no look of peace to the modocs
8578711 a s though the enumeration of his grievances and his thought of the home that he knew now he was not to have had broken the last thread of his resistance to violence and kindled fresh hated of the whites he shouted in modoc utwih kutt lets do it and fired at canby

8578723 the chamber has been very active ever since its inception realising one after the other the demands of the people in the region thanks to the support of successive state and central governments
8578724 we have formed the calicut it initiative recently with the support of iim and nit and several leading it companies have evinced interest to tap the potential from the region he said
8578725 in addition to a cyber park there is also a proposal to set up a techno park at ramnattukkara near here he said
8578726 we are working on a new list of activities that will gear up the region to compete with the best in the business in the it field he said
8578727 the governments invite our suggestions before every budget and many of our proposals concerning the region have been considered favourably
8578728 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8578729 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8578730 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8578731 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8578732 there is the u s labour day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8578733 what is and how do you calculate a cap rate
8578734 well i know of a few things we can do
8578735 hey i was wanting to know if youd join us at the park today

8578738 my character the prince of pain just wants to hurt people by any means he will do anything
8578739 the crowd hate me and i shout at them to tell them to sit down and shut up
8578740 its the largest relay in scotland and for just our second attempt its phenomenal
8578741 the total raised up to the end of sunday was almost 77 000 and well hit the 80 000 mark when its all collected
8578742 we took over 31 000 last year so we were originally hoping to raise 40 000 weve now doubled that which is brilliant
8578743 we were lucky with the weather we had just one shower of rain and we must have had around 1500 people at the candle ceremony
8578744 we had to deal with a few drunks who wandered in about 5 in the morning but everyone came away happy at the end of it all
8578745 its a great event and raises awareness not just of breast cancer but all types of the disease
8578746 its nice to see the survivors and its good for them to meet others who have also won their battle
8578747 early parts of the study have already shown that there is a viable business case for a ferry service between burntisland and granton
8578748 both services would provide a direct connection between fife and edinburgh avoiding the longer and more congested route via queensferry

8578755 what a boon to business and commuters if west fifers could get a good service to glasgow
8578756 the time is ripe for the line to be extended into dunfermline the link to alloa has been much more popular than the experts predicted
8578757 i have been talking for some time now to sestran officials on the need for a stage one appraisal and i am glad to see the idea being progressed
8578758 this is not a party issue but a dunfermline issue so its vital we get cross party support
8578759 an economically sustainable rail link on the north shore of the forth is good for the environment good for the economy and vital for the continued regeneration of dunfermline
8578760 i have no doubt the survey will show an answerable case for the major development to go ahead and will be a real driver for the fife economy
8578761 we dont know exactly where they would be situated thats why we are having a consultation so the public can have their say
8578762 now we need to give the issue a political shove and get it onto transport scotlands recommended programme
8578763 we are currently undertaking the strategic transport projects review which will look at potential transport investments between 2012 and 2022 to help deliver sustainable economic growth
8578764 the stpr will consider the importance of effective transport links in the dunfermline area and an announcement is expected later this year when ministers have considered their reports
8578765 i dont think there will be a single councillor against the proposals
8578766 for once i agree with david when he says this is not a party issue and that there should be cross party promotion
8578767 i figured youd go for a guy with a child
8578768 it was a great night done in true oscars format
8578769 the school was recognised as outstanding by the panel and was acknowledged within the community as working hard for the benefit of pupils
8578770 they also recognised our sporting achievements and our choirs success after we won the national saltire competition and others over the years to take learning beyond the classroom
8578771 it was a surprise to us because we did not realise we were nominated
8578772 its recognition for the pupils parents and staff who all work together so were really proud of this
8578773 to us its a major achievement and shows what a fantastic school townhill primary is
8578774 a few years ago they the judges were talking about banning myself from future competitions because id won it so many times
8578775 but the provost at the time said it would lower the competition so im still here
8578776 they also judge it on neatness the garden has to be immaculate and free of weeds so you have to stay on top of it to keep it in good condition
8578777 my wife mary helps out too and i often give vegetables to my neighbour who is a good cook and uses it to make different things such as soup
8578778 he often comes back with containers of the stuff so its a good arrangement
8578779 my advice for new gardeners is to work hard at it so i suppose you need dedication im still learning
8578780 a lot of new houses these days dont have big gardens so people arent able to get involved unless they have an allotment somewhere
8578781 houve algum interesse em converter o gasog nio em etanol durante a primeira crise do petr leo nos anos 1970
8578782 o problema foi que a tecnologia dos catalisadores naquela poca n o permitia uma seletividade nos subprodutos eles conseguiam produzir etanol mas tamb m geravam metano alde dos e v rios outros produtos indesejados
8578783 a grande vantagem de utilizar o gasog nio para produzir etanol que ele expande o tipo de material que pode ser convertido em combust vel
8578784 voc pode usar rejeitos de processos de destila o ou qualquer outra fonte de biomassa como capim ou polpa de madeira basicamente qualquer material base de carbono pode ser convertido em gasog nio e uma vez que tenhamos o gasog nio n s podemos transform lo em etanol
8578785 my mamma het n sussie in haar maag gehad maar nou is sy uit nou bly mamma en sussie in die hosipitaal gespel soos gese tot die dogster gespel soos gese gekyk het of hulle ok is en mamma nie meer so seer is nie
8578786 if hand hygiene isnt absolutely perfect and if the beds are too close together the bug can jump about
8578787 it raises the question of hygiene standards at the hospital in this kind of situation experience tells us that you do find that things werent as good as they should be
8578788 im not pointing the finger but if i was called in to look at it those would be the things i would be looking for right away
8578789 obviously it would have been better for all concerned if it was the new standard 3 4m but thats a very high standard and the old one 2 4m is not bad
8578790 an outbreak is more to do with aspects like hand washing and how patients are isolated from wards
8578791 i dont think they should have dogs in the hospital period
8578792 the only exception i would make would be if it was a guide dog
8578793 they have lived with a standard thats not good enough right the way through from 2003 to 2008 and they will be living with it in the queen margaret for another few years and dare i say in parts of the existing victoria as well and they wonder why they get outbreaks
8578794 bed distances obviously is a factor in stopping infections spreading but how much of a factor is open to interpretation
8578795 while the ward was closed to new admissions visitors were asked not to visit the ward during this time however it is not nhs fifes policy to stop visitors from entering wards
8578796 the achievement in containing the spread and maintaining enhanced precautions over a week to allow a rapid resolution is a great credit to the professionalism and dedication of the clinical facilities and infection control staff involved
8578797 during the trial we had people contacting us on issues such as workload communication with their colleagues and pupil behaviour
8578798 thirty two per cent of people we spoke to during the trial were contacting us on things to do with working conditions eg workload and management within the school and legal issues
8578799 the second most common problem 24 per cent was personal issues like births deaths or their own children
8578800 we can talk about how to improve communication or how to tackle a particularly difficult issue with a colleague
8578801 if a teacher has got a disruptive class we can talk through how to tackle that early on before that starts to get out of control
8578802 sometimes the back chatting and swearing over a long period of time can cause even the more experienced teacher to feel stressed and anxious
8578803 i think teaching has always been quite a high stress job because youre on show from the minute you walk through the school gates and you have got to be very resilient
8578804 we can be a listening ear and provide practical and emotional support and solutions to help people get through their challenges
8578805 while its good that a charity is getting itself involved we would obviously hope that although the council has made advances in terms of staff welfare this would act as a prompt for them to make further efforts in terms of staff welfare
8578806 there must be a bit of a gap in the market if a charity is coming in as it is
8578807 while we welcome that we would like to see the council and ourselves re double our efforts
8578808 most of the disabled bays in dunfermline have been taken up by taxis now and in the press two weeks ago it was stated that there would be plenty of disabled bays in the new kingsgate
8578809 there is not enough of them but what shocked and disgusted me is that they are charging the disabled to park in the disabled bays
8578810 its the only shopping centre in scotland that i know of which discriminates against the disabled for parking asda tesco and the queen margaret hospital all provide free parking for the disabled
8578811 the level i was on in the new kingsgate had no benches no seating at all for the disabled to have a rest
8578812 the car park used to be owned by the council but when the kingsgate was redeveloped the council sold the car park to the company and its quite common for car park operators to charge anybody who uses it
8578813 the worst bit is that it was not common knowledge that this was going to happen fife council could have warned people that when the kingsgate opened it was chargeable to disabled people
8578814 but that depends on what agreement fife council can come up with the car parking people
8578815 we provide spaces for all car users including those with a disability all car users are treated equally and fairly
8578816 the parking tariffs are appropriate for a short stay shoppers car park and the number of disabled bays are decided under the planning consent and building controls for the car park
8578817 there are definitely facilities on both levels not just for the disabled but for everyone to sit and have a rest
8578818 a lot of people who worked at rosyth have contacted us
8578819 its not only people from the fife area but people who travelled to work at rosyth from all over and also contractors who were there for a time
8578820 at yards across scotland these people were exposed negligently to asbestos but what weve seen time after time is that insurance companies have held up the process
8578821 when people fall ill weve found they are often still determined to get recognition of the cause before they die
8578822 many times like with john macdougall people have died without that happening which is tragic and means they can die without any financial worries regarding their family being settled
8578823 the man i took over from as shop steward had asbestosis
8578824 by the time i was there people were still going down and working with the stuff and it didnt matter how good the mask was at some point you had to take it off
8578825 we were working then to bring it restrictions and we had extractors installed to take out the dust
8578826 its fair to say all governments could do more in cases like these but the real villains of the piece are the insurance companies and the law lords
8578827 its the insurance companies who fight these cases and the law lords who bring in abysmal rulings
8578828 one was that you had to prove where the fibre came from which is a practical impossibility
8578829 another aspect of this is that asbestosis and mesothelioma are classed as incurable cancers but i would like to know how much money raised for research goes into finding a cure in this area
8578830 thats something that the trade unions should be looking at because there are cancers that have been incurable in the past but can now be treated
8578831 i knew john when he was serving his time at rosyth and we later were shop stewards together at methil
8578832 at rosyth he was an apprentice caulker to a friend of mine tony queen and he later died of the same thing
8578833 ive known many people who have died over the years some in their forties
8578834 it can take something like a bout of pneumonia to trigger off the disease and turn the pleural plaques into asbestosis
8578835 in the 1960s we knew nothing of the dangers of asbestos it was widely used for lagging on pipework and other applications it was used in a flooring composite for example
8578836 the laggers would have a carry on and thrown the asbestos about like snowballs
8578837 it was into the 1970s before the rumours started about its dangers and then there was a famous documentary that told the story
8578838 its sad that a labour mp has to sue his own government i knew another man who died from rosyth and in his case any settlement was delayed because a lawyer lost all the paperwork
8578839 its a very sad situation all around and it must have galling for john macdougall to sit on the same benches as those denying him compensation
8578840 there will be many other people without the same connections who have faced the same problems from their time at rosyth
8578841 well kira met jimmy at the bar where she used to work they hooked up and she went out on the road with them apparently she talked about me so much that they just had to meet me and here i am
8578842 the avenged boys have arrogance down to an art form ive had to learn a certain amount of cockiness in order to not have my self esteem slaughtered
8578843 his brother called the police and he waited with me for the ambulance then he came here to check on us

8578874 incluso dijo que su compatriota tuvo buenos motivos para actuar as
8578875 son unos defensores de la explotaci n y el saqueo del mundo
8578876 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8578877 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century
8578878 the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons
8578879 and the resurgence of fudamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8578880 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8578881 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years
8578882 policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place an unfair burden on the heores of our armed forces john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8578883 so who can we trust to keep america safe the mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again and again
8578884 with america fighting two wars the 9 11 terrorists still at large iran pursuing nuclear weapons and russia in georgia america needs a president who gets it right first time
8578885 the administration of george bush supported by john mccain every step of the way has let our warriors down
8578886 our troops are courageous strong and fierce this administration has re deployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained
8578887 yeah we just bought everything in one day from ikea
8578888 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8578889 in light of the trying times that the airline sector is currently experiencing as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel costs we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year
8578890 i came across two little black marsh fly puparia case of the pupa and kept them in jam jars on my desk expecting that adult marsh flies might hatch but what emerged were two different species of parasitic wasp
8578891 when we finally discovered that one of these insects had never been recorded before the question then was what to call this creature
8578892 after resisting the temptation to name it after someone i know who really wants to be named after a parasite we settled on naming it mesoleptus hibernica in honour of the country where it was discovered
8578893 fantastic the program is much more likely to be successful if there is community support
8578894 look pretty good the devils in the details and we dont have all the details
8578895 government cameras are probably less likely to be abused than neighborhood cameras the operators of government cameras face the potential loss of employment if they use the cameras improperly while volunteers in the neighborhood centers have nothing to lose
8578896 the neighborhood groups are responsible for their own data retention
8578897 to the extent that a benign activity occurs in the public right of way
8578898 the only reason the neighborhood group would be keeping footage is if there is an ongoing investigation and the police are involved im sure they dont have anyone who would be watching 24 hours a day or even 8 hours a day
8578899 study after study by cities law enforcement agencies universities and civic groups have shown that camera surveillance systems do not significantly reduce crime
8578900 they can sometimes be useful in post crime investigations but cameras are easily stymied by sunglasses hats or hoodies
8578901 what criteria will be used to measure the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the system will the city merely look at crime around the cameras or will they take into account the fact that often cameras merely displace the crime to another area where there is no camera
8578902 will reveal whether any camera has an impact on the overall crime rate
8578903 its a few years since we havent been in the final and we dont want it to start this year now
8578904 its an all ireland semi final with a place in the all ireland final at stake and we have a good record in semi finals
8578905 its disappointing we didnt get through when we looked to be heading for a place in the final
8578906 the last few weeks have proved to be a testing and uncertain time for all employed at the club
8578907 it is our fervent hope that the club will emerge from these difficulties and we will all do everything in our power to assist in this
8578908 at this point we once again appeal to our loyal fans whose support over the past few weeks has been absolutely magnificent and the people of cork to get behind the club in the coming weeks
8578909 the re formation of the center has caused a big southward change and gustav is now forecast to pass near the south coast of jamaica
8578910 more to the west and the northwest around the time it enters the gulf of mexico
8578911 there are so many new options on the market this year and one of the biggest pieces of the tour is the redevelopment in over the rhine
8578912 theyve done a phenomenal job in the gateway quarter and people are very excited about the affordable price ranges
8578913 theyre not just doing it because its a trend its a lifestyle choice
8578914 there are so many new options on the market this year and one of the biggest pieces of the tour is the redevelopment in over the rhine
8578915 theyve done a phenomenal job in the gateway quarter and people are very excited about the affordable price ranges
8578916 theyre not just doing it because its a trend its a lifestyle choice
8578917 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8578918 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8578919 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8578920 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8578921 france is not in favour of cutting relations with russia this will be solved by negotiation we need time were under no illusion about that
8578922 apart from that my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8578923 the figures may be an indication that the falling mortality rates from cardiovascular disease are beginning to reverse
8578924 based on the belief that the transaction would not receive shareholder approval due to market conditions in the financial services sector
8578925 tailwind will continue to seek other business combinations with targets in a variety of industries
8578926 the impact is huge in terms of lives lost and harmed as well as the injustice if inequality there is a real and fundamental cost to the economy
8578927 this analysis demonstrates the extent to which reducing health inequalities and improving the health of the population depends on preventative measures across a range of policies
8578928 officer were about to go to europe to represent american heavy metal in front of hundreds of thousands of people you cant arrest us
8578929 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8578930 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8578931 our ports business performed strongly in the first half and we remain confident that the group will have another successful year
8578932 i always wondered what happened to emma and her family
8578933 i was shocked but it was a good feeling to actually speak to her its very unusual to meet the people we help so long after the event
8578934 the fire started in the kitchen and was well alight when we got there it started burning through into the bedroom above and the house was full of smoke
8578935 firefighters always work as a team but i was the one who went into the bedroom and carried emma out they wouldnt have lasted long in there
8578936 i have never known the identity of the firefighter who saved me
8578937 to come face to face with him after all these years was an amazing coincidence
8578938 i dont remember much about the fire but he was telling me how quickly the fire spread and how frightened i was
8578939 the storm will pass the rainbow awaits you until then ive got umbrellas
8578940 thanks very much its been really fun i think this poker fashion is probably over now so were going to replace that with a show jumping column if you could come up with something else thatd be great
8578941 i cant believe you said i should fold a full house
8578942 phil hellmuth reads the guardian people in the uk dont even read the guardian so how the hell has he seen it
8578943 im terribly sorry i dont know what i was thinking of course you couldnt pass
8578944 id very happily do something with you if youre interested
8578945 while were talking about it why dont you put me in the london ept come on its my home casino it would be fun dont you want me wearing pokerstars in my home event
8578946 oh go on then well give you a free seat in that if you wear the logo
8578947 youve got a tell when you do this and a tell when you do that
8578948 listen youve got a tell and im not going to tell you about it now because were still in the game but i know 100 for certain when youre bluffing
8578949 were back in below radar mode at the moment so theres no news or info i can share yet
8578950 zelden heeft een partij zo enthousiast meegewerkt aan de eigen vernietiging als agalev
8578951 france is definitely the good place to be when working around open source
8578952 the french was appropriate for innovators and entrepreneurs to start working on alternative solutions to fostering the creation of new projects in which a good mix of experienced professionals and work together
8578953 in the u s open source projects tend to be narrow and only for leading edge organizations whereas in europe theyre mainstream
8578954 european organizations have a business opportunity to combine multiple open source point projects into solutions for business intelligence
8578955 my priority at this time is to be able to effectively perform my duty as vice president housing czar presidential adviser on ofws and to continue my task of monitoring the prices of basic commodities
8578956 if i join a political party now all my efforts to help our countrymen will be given political color i do not want partisan affiliation to get in the way of effective public service at this point in time my priority is to serve our people and i will always act based on what is in the best interest of our nation
8578957 these protests are just in betweens there will be something bigger happening in september
8578958 the arroyo government better not be stubborn this is just a prelude to a nation wide transport strike we are gearing up for next month if our demands are not met
8578959 p6 7 which is roughly equivalent to the oil price hikes in may and june this year we are concerned that it is taking the oil companies forever to give consumers a substantial relief from high oil prices
8578960 the small rollbacks while welcome are not enough given the huge increases over the past few months
8578961 with vat prices of commodities have gone so high the majority of poor families are feeling the impact especially women and children
8578962 inflation has already reached 11 4 percent the highest in 14 years and all the government does is to tell us the vat is good for us this surely doesnt make much sense given the severe economic burden on the people and the ensuing economic slowdown facing the country
8578963 a total ceasefire is unacceptable because of the fact that we have a law to enforce
8578964 katos men are sniping at our men we have enough men on the ground so the rebels cannot retake their camps which we overran
8578965 i think there will be tactical adjustments it will depend upon the commander operating in one area
8578966 but it also depends on how the fugitives will use ramadan to shield their actions i mean what they have done are un islamic how do you expect them to conform to islamic norms when they have slaughtered people
8578967 if the evidence shows it then the evidence will point out too that they have not been sincere in the peace process all along
8578968 i mean the question of proving sincerity and good faith now lies squarely on the shoulders of the milf i mean coddling criminals is not a sign of bona fide sincerity in anyones book
8578969 but whether we will do it or not is a different matter madaling maglagay ng 12 kandidato it is easy to field 12 candidates anyone can put up a one full slate but the winnability of the candidates is another thing
8578970 he escudero is qualified he is popular compared with other candidates
8578971 travelers tourists or ofws are approached by members of criminal syndicates and are offered attractive amounts of cash if they will carry luggage or parcels for delivery to a certain person at their point of destination these items of luggage or parcels invariably contain narcotics or illicit drugs
8578972 filipino nationals are urged to exercise caution in their travels overseas and to report any incident involving offers such as those indicated above to the philippine drug enforcement agency pdea hotline no 920 0967 if they are in the philippines or to the nearest philippine embassy or consulate if they are overseas
8578973 it appears that the victim knew the suspected assailant because she allowed him to enter the house and they had an argument
8578974 monetary policy needs to be appropriately tight to stabilize inflation to within the target range over the policy horizon and to help manage inflation expectations
8578975 moreover fluctuations in international oil prices continue to pose a major risk to the inflation outlook
8578976 the central bank is saying that oil prices continue to pose a risk and that inflation is probably going to be exceeding the target in 2008 and more importantly in 2009
8578977 extending our trading hours will open our stock market to more investments by creating an overlapping link in trading hours with other exchanges
8578978 it is also a response to observations from foreign investors who pointed out that since the philippine stock market is small they first look at the bigger markets in the morning but by the time they get the opportunity to look at our market the pse is already closing so why bother at all
8578979 achieving the full year target will be a tough challenge as we continue to face high food and oil prices
8578980 economic growth in the philippines as well as those of asian neighbors was dragged down by high inflation and slower growth among advanced economies which hurt consumer demand
8578981 i think for now the argument that slower growth should mean that the central bank should not hike rates today is a flawed one because inflation still lingers around the corner
8578982 growth without price stability is probably not going to be a sustained one
8578983 we will remain watchful of developments to make sure that our policy stance is consistent with our price stability mandate
8578984 the weak q2 gdp figure and the expectation that inflation may be peaking out may probably allow the central bank to go on hold for the rest of the year as growth concerns outpace inflationary risk
8578985 before the revision we were looking at growth of 4 8 percent for the philippines for this year probably even 4 0 percent may be a bit tough and we may have to relook at 2009 since my earlier number was 3 9 percent the downside risk is both for the 2008 and 2009 forecasts
8578986 the spotty us health care system and weak welfare net could explain why americans have stopped growing
8578987 we surmise that the health systems and high degree of social security in europe provide better conditions for growth than the american health system despite the fact that the system costs twice as much
8578988 there are also indications that american diets are deficient in several areas
8578989 the greed arrogance scandal and hardball business practices of too many multinational corporations
8578990 save their seeds which include seeds the iraqis themselves have developed over hundreds of years
8578991 when we started this effort it was the only way for us to be able to vote in denver to represent the people who elected us
8578992 were proud of what we did were going to see it to the end just like our candidate we dont quit
8578993 since we never consulted with senator clintons campaign we dont know if the petition that wouldnt die had anything to do with the two joint campaign announcements made last week we will probably never know but it certainly made us feel good
8578994 the philippines is attractive because the education is american based we are so impressed with the quality and caliber of teachers there
8578995 it will be better if they constitute themselves as a police auxiliary and place themselves under the control of pnp
8578996 they cannot take law into their hands we say no to vigilantism we will not allow the indiscriminate arming of civilians
8578997 we will have to check their previous records and we want all firearms to be properly documented they must conform to all our processes
8578998 2 0 startups and has been a fundamental part of the success
8578999 talagang niratrat yung mobile car namin pero nakaganti ng putok ang mga pulis natin gamit ang shotgun they really riddled our mobile car but the police fired back with shotguns
8579000 it seems they were watching the ucpb bank when the policemen spotted them
8579001 for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections from export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana and actaeon and diana and callisto might be sold
8579002 now the paintings have been offered on remarkably advantageous terms their acquisition by both institutions would be an historic event
8579003 the present initiative is intended to secure the long term future of the loan for the public benefit
8579004 same failed bush mccain economic policies in florida that have already driven the american economy into a recession
8579005 if mccain is looking for a running mate whose loyalty to bush and especially to bushs irresponsible failed economic policies rivals his own he cant do better than crist florida has a 2 billion budget shortfall to prove it mccain crist is just bush cheney with a sunshine state twist
8579006 stepped in to help mastermind labours bid to beat the odds and win the glenrothes by election
8579007 we are not sure where this story came from but as prime minister gordon will be focused on running the country and the party will be focused on running the by election
8579008 earlier this year ofgem said power companies had ended up with a 9bn windfall because of a quirk in the scheme in its second phase polluting companies must buy on average 7 per cent of the permits they need to pollute for power companies its about 30 per cent yet the price of electricity has risen as if companies had to pay for 100 per cent of their permits thus the ofgem figure but the 9bn was based on carbon permits at 20 each whereas the market price is now 25 to 30 that means mps unions and others who complain about the ets windfall can now use a new figure well north of 11bn
8579009 this would make it much harder to move to 30 percent cuts automatically as the eu would have to go through the whole co decision procedure and it could even prevent it altogether
8579010 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8579011 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8579012 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8579013 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8579014 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8579015 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to repair our badly strained military his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8579016 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8579017 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8579018 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8579019 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8579020 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8579021 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it
8579022 i would very much urge my side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle to provide an affirmative vote
8579023 obama would not be where he is or even close without that 2004 keynote
8579024 words that shook the world 100 years of unforgettable speeches and events
8579025 if the voter base begins to feel like all hes interested in is the big numbers and isnt interested in the individual especially those independents and crossover republicans
8579026 its been such a joy to take this show to so many countries that ive never been to before but its a real thrill to finally be bringing it home to australia and to be able to share it with you all
8579027 there is no relief or rescue work going on and we have not received any help we are suffering and there is no end to the suffering
8579028 the government has not even arranged for boats we have to swim to the fields harvest crops and sell them for half the price
8579029 civilian personnel who are not authorized to carry firearms and are taking up arms and airing a threat of killing people in retaliation for certain incidents is pure and simple illegal
8579030 whatever justification whether to defend your self or run after a group when you are unauthorized to carry firearms what you are doing is illegal
8579031 the good news is that in 2012 in london and the south east prices will recover to the levels they were in 2007
8579032 august as exceptionally quiet and july was also very quiet there is likely to be an early shut down of the market for christmas so november will be dead as well as december in any down period the quiet times come early
8579033 the good news is that in 2012 in london and the south east prices will recover to the levels they were in 2007
8579034 august as exceptionally quiet and july was also very quiet there is likely to be an early shut down of the market for christmas so november will be dead as well as december in any down period the quiet times come early
8579035 the good news is that in 2012 in london and the south east prices will recover to the levels they were in 2007

8579038 august as exceptionally quiet and july was also very quiet there is likely to be an early shut down of the market for christmas so november will be dead as well as december in any down period the quiet times come early
8579039 what we want policy to do is to create the conditions that empower people so that all people have the freedom to live flourishing lives
8579040 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8579041 what we want policy to do is to create the conditions that empower people so that all people have the freedom to live flourishing lives

8579043 what we want policy to do is to create the conditions that empower people so that all people have the freedom to live flourishing lives
8579044 following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8579045 to be honest with the people im going to work for
8579046 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8579047 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
8579048 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven to eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8579049 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8579050 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
8579051 this is not afghanistans government demand nor the demand of afghanistans people
8579052 we need the foreign forces until our own military institutions are able to defend afghanistan
8579053 wow couldnt you just tell me if im not satisfying you
8579054 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8579055 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8579056 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8579057 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs

8579061 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park

8579100 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end

8579102 im proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for all our children
8579103 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8579104 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8579105 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8579106 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8579107 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8579108 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8579109 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8579110 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8579111 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8579112 his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8579113 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8579114 his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an evermore interdependent world
8579115 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park

8579199 watching john elway lead the broncos to come from behind as often as he did
8579200 it got to a point where i expected to be on the edge of my seat every week
8579201 there are a lot of us out there and theres a reason these jobs dont come open very often on top of that to do it in this kind of town with this kind of culture and these kinds of fans its a dream job
8579202 i got the call in the middle of a minor league baseball game i was calling
8579203 i saw the 434 area code on my cell phone and had to resist the urge to answer the phone on the air that was the longest half inning of my career
8579204 im trying to absorb as much as i can at this point
8579205 so much of this job is preparation youre looking for three or four factoids about each player that would be of interest to fans i wont use all of it but i like to have it to turn to
8579206 i have a built in excuse to sit on the couch and watch sports but that excuse is starting to get a little old with my wife
8579207 i think shed just as soon throw the tv out the window
8579208 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8579209 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8579210 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8579211 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8579212 fuc eth them if they canst not take a joke
8579213 are able to develop and publish the evidence to prove theres not a negative difference in the impact on young people
8579214 he holds his tongue and keeps a low profile but he also knows how to act before its too little too late
8579215 i think hes understood never to get too excited about things
8579216 you have to look at the long term and not just the short term issues that may create a lot of controversy but detract from the mission
8579217 that our kids graduate on time and that our program be run ethically
8579218 hes always understood the role of athletics for alumni giving
8579219 its hard to balance that with academic concerns sometimes but its essential especially in the acc
8579220 that the conclusions of this report make this is a sad day in our history
8579221 we are committed from this day to exercise leadership and institutional control to ensure that the highest standards are maintained by the university
8579222 theres a process you follow whenever you discover this kind of thing and we followed that process to the letter
8579223 we were not going to tolerate ncaa violations it went to the heart of who we were
8579224 if you look around the country and see how college presidents lose their jobs
8579225 its generally because they either did too little too late or acted too quickly and too drastically in this case as he does in most cases he knew when something required immediate action but he also knew that sometimes people get mad about something and it sorts itself out
8579226 its one thing to do things quickly quite another to do things intelligently
8579227 the vote represents a longing for a time where external challenges to higher education were non existent
8579228 the demand for collaboration among departments was purely voluntary and campus government was conducted over coffee and confined to the ivy walls
8579229 you have to make sure the university isnt too controlled by the faculty
8579230 so it can respond through the ups and downs of the economy
8579231 i was a carrier fan but the way in which the program was being ram rodded through the faculty was not something i could support its all part and parcel of a kind of university run like a 19th century coal company rather than a university
8579232 it wasnt about the faculty i left because i had current jmu president linwood rose ready to go i was 66 and my wife didnt want to go to any more fundraisers
8579233 when you have to change direction as we did at jmu when youre trying to make it into the kind of university we did youre likely to get more controversy and encounter a whole other set of problems
8579234 i ask for their vision of the university i ask for their political support i ask for their membership on committees i ask for their children
8579235 no university depending solely on public money is going to be truly first rate its impossible those billions are the margin of excellence
8579236 if you dont want personal issues you dont do it at all
8579237 if youre not willing to accept the pain you need to get out
8579238 its nice to be back weve played fridays after five for ten years in a row
8579239 weve played lots of fancy places but fridays is always a nice energetic crowd
8579240 they flew 27 of us families included and it was all you could eat and drink
8579241 our performance is part of the paint the town orange night
8579242 at eight well do a number with the marching band for the huge football game the next day football players will be there cheerleaders will be there the coach will probably be there
8579243 fridays after five is usually a very casual event but its a big deal for us
8579244 theres nothing more fun than playing at home in front of people you know and love
8579245 they laugh and say youll come back to us but i wont it wouldnt be worth doing at all if i had to do that
8579246 the single biggest construction error ive made was not putting parking under the terraces
8579247 i want to show the city what can be done
8579248 the single biggest construction error ive made was not putting parking under the terraces
8579249 its just not an appropriate intervention its clever but not sympathetic to the historic house
8579250 i would be open to looking at something theres a precedent for more modern structures on water street
8579251 a private charlottesville based investment group that also has holdings in banking real estate development and building materials
8579252 sometimes when theres a subtle transition when its close but not exact it can look like a mistake
8579253 i would try to think of a way to improve the traffic congestion on the corner and in all of charlottesville id have more people riding bicycles
8579254 we thought like print people who went on the web we did milquetoast traditional small town coverage of local government meetings
8579255 we did that objectivity thing but now its hard to stand back to referee
8579256 i see it as a blog for chris graham to attack people in the community i think its a disgrace he puts himself off as a journalist but hes a rumormonger
8579257 chris does his homework what he brings to the table is lets make sure were looking at the big picture
8579258 i thought i had to have something for people to read at 8am
8579259 now its all day long if something happens at 2 i want to get it up
8579260 i thought 100 percent of our efforts would go to online publishing
8579261 i wouldnt say the mining sector is slowing down just because one mine is slowing down
8579262 did you ever find out why that flight was cancelled
8579263 mr emory says there was no rain in either atlanta or charlottesville so do you know what weather specifically caused it
8579264 that was a congested weekend up in the northeast so it could have been weather along the flight path
8579265 we keep records on these flights and all we put down is weather no one ever asked me for more details than that before
8579266 is this sort of experience the norm are flights to charlottesville more likely to be cancelled than flights to cincinnati
8579267 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8579268 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8579269 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8579270 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8579271 with three real examples we hope that we have shown that such trials are feasible and can lead to major improvements in speed and decision making
8579272 further study of the arid4 gene family may advance our understanding of the connection between gene regulation epigenetic control disease development and cancer formation
8579273 we also suggest that gene regulation by the arid4a and arid4b should be examined for potential disease related roles not only in human malignancies but also in other complex disease traits
8579274 our findings suggest that individuals presenting with features of inherited rcc susceptibility should be screened for germ line sdhb mutations because surveillance for sdhb related tumors can then be offered to mutation positive patients and relatives
8579275 it is entirely appropriate at this time to counsel patients carrying sdhb mutations espe cially those with arg mutations that they have a small but finite likelihood of developing rcc
8579276 dear dream power tonight when the bully comes to cause me trouble i will refuse to run or be intimidated instead i will walk right up to this menace and demand to know what he wants
8579277 shatter into pieces perhaps dividing itself along internal fault structures defined by organs and tissues
8579278 were this not the case eagles might be as large as tigers and as formidable to humans as hostile airplanes
8579279 at a time when young women want to have their cake and bake it too and are likely to be judged for doing either determining what it means to be a fearless female is more complicated than ever
8579280 a saudi court will next month hear a plea for divorce from an eight year old girl married off by her father to a man in his fifties the arabic language daily al watan reported today it said the girls mother had filed the divorce case with the court at unayzah 220km north of riyadh and cited lawyer abdullah jtili as saying the father had arranged the marriage without telling the girl but the daily also reported that the husband had refused to renounce the marriage saying that he had not done anything illegal arranged marriages involving pre adolescents are occasionally reported in the arabian peninsula including in the ultra conservative saudi kingdom where the strict conservative wahabi version of sunni islam holds sway and polygamy is common in yemen in april another girl aged eight was granted a divorce after her unemployed father forced her to marry a man of 28
8579281 they have been widely denounced by activists clerics and others who say such unions are harmful to the children and trivialize the institution of marriage saudi arabia is already rocked by a high divorce rate that has jumped from 25 percent to 60 percent over the past 20 years according to noura al shamlan head of the research department at the center of university studies for girls
8579282 the grand mufti of saudi arabia in recent press statements has rightly warned parents against marrying their young daughters to men who are older than them by 50 and 60 years or more he described such practices as an indication of lack of conscience on the part of the parents he also said such marriages will not protect the chastity of the girls and may drive them toward sinful acts the mufti stressed that the young girl will be living in agony while her parents enjoy the comforts her dowry can buy them we have heard about a father who married his 10 year old girl to a man in his 70s for a dowry of sr150 000 the human rights commission hrc intervened and delayed the marriage for five years just imagine the situation of a desperate child considered to be a married woman and the old man demanding his conjugal rights this will definitely rob the girl of her innocence when the consummation of marriage takes place five years later she will be just 15 while her husband will be in his 80s fathers like these consider their daughters to be slaves selling them to the highest bidder or they compel them to marry their relatives or men from their tribe the grand mufti has clearly stated his position on these types of marriages what remains now is the cooperation of all concerned agencies to put a halt to such abuses as most of the cases take place in remote villages where there is poverty and illiteracy we need to launch a campaign to make people aware of the social and moral implications of such marriages the mother should not hesitate to inform the police if the father insists on marrying his child to an old man the officials who write the marriage contracts should alert the hrc to such practices so that they step in to stop it in time it will be good if we decide a certain age for marriage
8579283 the saudi human rights commission hrc has called on government agencies to take necessary steps to end the practice of child marriages by adopting a clear and unambiguous position on such weddings
8579284 such marriages violate human rights by depriving a girl of her childhood
8579285 social conservatives are wrong to blame womens entry into work on feminism but women who work are much more likely to adopt feminist inspired agendas and to reject traditional ideas about marriage and when women gain economic and political clout traditional family life is indeed destabilised in western europe and north america divorce rates soared as married women poured into the workplace in the 1970s and 1980s with women initiating most divorces although divorce rates levelled off in the 1990s cohabitation and unwed childbearing have continued to rise of course marriage will never again be as stable or predictable as when women lacked alternatives but even where family change continues apace it has far less negative consequences when women have access to economic rights than when they do not far from being a threat to family life the further progress of womens rights may be our best hope for well functioning families
8579286 today many social conservatives still blame friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace thus destabilizing families and placing their children at risk but feminism was always more of a response to women entering the labor force than its cause in western europe and the us early capitalism drew huge numbers of young single women into industries like textiles mill owners often built dormitories to house young female workers many of these workers became early supporters of both the anti slavery and the womens rights movements while middle class women were energized by and sometimes envious of working womens vigorous participation in the public sphere by the time friedans book was published in 1963 capitalism was drawing married women into the expanding service clerical and information sectors friedans ideas spoke to a generation of women who were starting to view paid work as something more than a temporary break between adolescence and marriage and were frustrated by societys insistence that the only source of meaning in their lives should be their role as housewives the dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past 40 years has been closely connected to womens expanded participation in paid employment societies where women remain substantially under represented in the labor market such as in the middle east remain especially resistant to womens rights as women gain collective rights and especially as men accept womens changed roles many of the disruptive effects of family change are ameliorated in the us divorce rates for well educated women are now much lower than for less educated women and women with good jobs or who have completed college are more likely than more traditional women to be married at age 35 in the past when a stay at home wife went to work the chance that her marriage would dissolve increased today going to work decreases the chance of divorce in families where the wife has been employed longer men tend to do more and better child care with measurable payoffs in child outcomes
8579287 a nepali housemaid is fighting for her life after suffering sadistic torture and rape by her sponsor said pushparaj bhattarai a spokesman for the nepalese embassy yesterday the woman who was identified only as maya walked into the local nepalese mission yesterday showing evidence of physical and sexual abuse including injuries to her abdomen this is the eighth case of the brutal rape of a nepali maid reported within the last three months in saudi arabia last month a nepali maid took shelter at the embassy after being abducted and gang raped by seven men the 22 year old maid was forced into a car taken to a remote location raped by the men and later dropped off at the same place from where she was picked up in another case in june a maid was gang raped by four men and then abandoned at the embassys entrance
8579288 the sri lankan government has called on saudi insurance companies to submit quotations for mandatory insurance to cover sri lankan domestic aides such as maids and drivers in the kingdom colombo has drafted the new insurance scheme because the saudi governments current insurance system does not include domestic aides working in saudi households more than 80 percent of the 550 000 sri lankan workers in the kingdom are housemaids whose earnings make up a large portion of foreign remittances to the country remittances from sri lankan overseas workers are the islands second largest foreign exchange earner
8579289 sri lanka is planning to trim the number of maids employed in the middle east a labor official has reportedly said kingsley ranawaka chairman of the sri lanka bureau of foreign employment slbfe was recently quoted by an international media source as saying that lankan labor officials have decided to curb the number of housekeepers due to the number of complaints of ill treatment received from lankan maids in the region the bureau said that in the first half of this year it received a total of 3 400 complaints including 577 cases of breach of contract and 479 cases of sexual abuse and other forms of physical violence as well as complaints of unpaid or underpaid salaries saudi arabia in particular has been a main market for sri lankan workers for years as many as 500 000 maids work in the kingdom at any time according to data published by the sri lankan embassy in riyadh

8579317 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8579318 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8579319 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8579320 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8579321 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8579392 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
8579393 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8579394 allan monks of the economic and policy research team at jp morgan said that while the figures showed a glimmer of hope for the housing market mixed messages from the treasury over the deferral of stamp duty would probably hold back the prospect of any immediate recovery

8579522 i wouldnt make an invitation to my turkish counterpart if i didnt believe in the significance of his visit weve been neighbors for centuries and have survived through many difficulties armenia is in favor of development of our relations and expects the same from turkish side
8579523 i would not encourage them if didnt believe they were useful for us
8579524 we have to make important decisions for the development of our relations these decisions will not be easy but i hope both armenian and turkish people will encourage them
8579525 every armenian from any part of the world still believes that the genocide did take place but we dont make this an essential condition for improvement of our relations

8579538 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8579539 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8579540 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8579580 the first half of 2008 has seen venture back on the growth path as demonstrated by strong operating and financial performance across all areas of our business with the exception of the delay to the start up of chestnut field production and operating performance was in line with our expectations and combined with high commodity prices has led to a record financial performance our successful drilling results this year together with our active field development programme means that we currently have seven new development projects which are expected to come on stream over the next two years in addition 2008 is proving to be a very busy period for acquisitions which has added to our longer term appraisal and development inventory in particular we have continued to strengthen our gas business at a time when the market fundamentals for uk and european gas markets appear very favourable venture is extremely well capitalised and we remain poised to pursue new business development opportunities to continue this growth

8579595 and album graphics are some of my earliest memories i always loved the type hand drawn and typeset carefully kerned and arranged by hand my mother still has many beautiful jazz albums and cool jazz was the soundtrack to my young life
8579596 i hope to pull readers into the late night clubs of 1957 feeling the music through the visuals
8579597 what 50s designers lacked in modern printing methods they made up for in raw skill with their tools
8579598 im still in awe over what they were able to accomplish by hand
8579599 my typefaces are passable but like typographers predicted with the rise of desktop publishing in the 80s the fonts dont have quite the grace and balance of their 50s counterparts
8579600 but the look of jazz cool birth comes mostly from unknown uncredited artists working in a beat style in a decade where nearly every printed piece contained some kind of drawn graphic
8579601 i took to drawing preliminaries with a thick sharpie marker so i wouldnt tighten up
8579602 i then imported scans into illustrator and redrew with abandon experimenting with brush strokes and flat solids without restraint
8579603 the section of my brain ive developed through decades of printing project prep surprisingly took over balance and imbalance emotion with color storytelling with graphic symbols and type as art all sort of changed my view of what comic book art should be
8579604 what i learned from studying craftsmen of 50 years ago is to never let the tools dictate where something lays on a page the modern computer typesetters practice of distorting type rather than adjusting the letter spacing and kerning is lazy uninformed and unattractive typography is a line by line art dig

8579609 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8579610 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8579611 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8579612 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8579613 arnelle had a fight with christie photo below over christies behavior thats what started the whole thing
8579614 christie has some problems with drinking and arnelle got mad o j said dont talk to her like that and arnelle pushed him
8579615 cut on the back of his head blood was coming out the side of his mouth and his lip was cut
8579616 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8579617 during a secondary screening process she was found in possession of what appeared to be a small amount of heroin and cocaine
8579618 she was arrested for possession of a controlled substance a felony and transported to the airport station
8579619 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation
8579620 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread
8579621 i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are
8579622 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8579623 we have lost the appeal that means he will be extradited it will probably be within the next fortnight
8579624 he is absolutely devastated by the decision he and his family are distraught they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8579625 this was their last chance we are going to write to the secretary of state and ask her to reconsider it again
8579626 states with broad continental margins also have rights to exploit the resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles but they are required to provide the commission with scientific evidence concerning the location of the outer limit of the shelf
8579627 if states dont claim it the seabed becomes part of what is known as the area which comes under international control
8579628 the bottom line is it is a nuisance for us
8579629 the crew is working with teams on the ground to eradicate the virus and look for actions to prevent that from happening in the future
8579630 its a good neighborhood and you hate to see kids wrapped up in stuff thats just senseless playing around with guns people could have lost their life
8579631 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search
8579632 if were seeing a number of the guys who are committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
8579633 yeah so she pretty much screamed and ran for it
8579634 well to tell the truth and from experiance most girls are scared a hell lot out of bugs me as well but you shino your bugs are an exception
8579635 besides were only 12 we have quite the long time i myself am content with my friends and being a genin
8579636 shes been asked millions of times rejected them all too they just had to be on the times that we needed to train or spend time together i insisted for her to go but she didnt want to
8579637 id expect for her to be asked a lot shes popular at school and very attractive
8579638 theres no one prettier than ino and no kunoichi more skilled than she
8579639 youre the one who said we pay for as much as we eat and youre the one who decided to eat like 7 bowls of ramen
8579640 i heard that the d ranked missions are easy ttebayo will you be giving our team those
8579641 but jii san we may have had a little bit of trouble at the zabuza mission but it seemed more like a b or a mission must we seriously do all these d ranked missions
8579642 its for the rookies to learn responsibility teamwork and to learn dedication
8579643 ill make a deal how about you only do 5 d ranked missions and then ill send you on a c ranked mission to see how it goes from that ill decided whether to let your team do c ranked mission instead of d then again i must speak with your sensei
8579644 i could hear her footsteps and she smells of dango
8579645 shino showed me his lady bug collection i swear i used to hate them but after his lecture i think that theyre pretty cool
8579646 be honest the last time a ladybug landed on you you ran in circles thenpulled the ladybug off yourself
8579647 i remember a lot of things ino even the things that you think are insignificant
8579648 i remember when i first beat you with these weights on
8579649 i want to see if i can beat you guys again
8579650 its because we dont know his abilities as much as each others
8579651 oh a mission a d rank mission what are we doing what are we doing
8579652 for this mission you will be returning a kids kite
8579653 yeah so she pretty much screamed and ran for it
8579654 i wont lie and say that im not disappointed in you for allowing lafarge and his follows escape vesuvius
8579655 i expect better from the captain of my elite guard
8579656 although i do admit that you finished your work sooner than anticipated do you have the resequencer
8579657 had i retained my human form it would have taken me another 10 days to analyze groundons dna and create the resequencing formula now that i have a metagross supercomputer like brain and psychic abilities it only took me two hours
8579658 unlike the previous formulae ive experimented on the transformation begins instantly and completes itself in a matter of minutes i thought youd be satisfied
8579659 that means i can now execute operation rubicon ahead of schedules ill see that youre rewarded handsomely in my new order
8579660 you have been generous enough lord volcanus i only wish to continue my experiments into the human and pokemon genome
8579661 and have everyone gather in the assembly hall within the hour its time to rally the troops
8579662 the time has come my people youve been beaten and whipped like curs across hoenn from rustboro city to mossdeep humiliated by a child from littleroot town and left to wander the desert after your leader abandoned you i tell you those dark days are over we will expand the continents and then we will conquer hoenn will be ours but we wont stop there well conquer johto kanto and even the snowy wastes of sinnoh for its our right as pokemorphs
8579663 i know some of you wonder why i havent taken on pokemon form the truth is i was waiting waiting for a shape worthy to lead this organization to greatness
8579664 i shall assume the form of our inspiration i shall become groundon
8579665 and woe be to those who stand in the way between me and destiny
8579666 when we heard your bodies were never found we were afraid you had been kidnapped or worse
8579667 those bastards did more than turn me into this thing they had to violate my mind as well i dont know how to feel anymore when i see my mother or when she gives me a hug
8579668 arent you happy to be home i thought id never see you again after you disappeared
8579669 sort of oh i dont know i havent felt like myself since coming back firebrawl
8579670 wait a minute i havent had root beer or any other soda for years now
8579671 you said something about not having any soda for years
8579672 oh yeah ive been having these cravings for it ever since i escaped and now i have trouble concentrating
8579673 youve been there with me since my journey began brawl
8579674 i like to say ive grown into a reasonably well adjusted adult from that loud and impulsive ten year old who would never listened to anybody tell me im still the trainer you know firebrawl please
8579675 you are blaze my trainer friend whether youre human or dragonair
8579676 join me and well end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy
8579677 if only you knew the power of the dawwwwwwwk side
8579678 very funny for someone who skinny dipped in a fountain in celadon city on a bet when he was twelve
8579679 its not my fault you thought i wouldnt do something that crazy
8579680 anyway professor palmer called while you were out here brooding
8579681 i put her on hold but she sounded quite serious so i wouldnt keep her waiting
8579682 its good to see returned home safely blaze and you do look rather fetching as a dragonair if i may say so myself
8579683 i suppose the question of how you know is not of paramount concern but yes i found an anomaly in your shifting genetic structure while you were detained by team magma
8579684 rvn is a key factor in human development particularly in adolescence
8579685 rvn takes on veroxic sequences that determine how develop into adults in your case the serum that resequenced your dna into a half pokemon hybrid is also undoing those veroxic sequences which means your transformation will be far more drastic than i first thought
8579686 your body is reverting to a previous stage of development i cant say how far it go the transformation can take you anywhere from preadolescence to infancy
8579687 anywhere from twelve to eighteen hours if i entered my calculations correctly
8579688 look i know there six more human pokemon hybrids currently residing on your parents property kyles test results confirmed that the serum did not affect his rvn but i dont know if the others were affected the same way you were
8579689 were sorry that number could not be connected as dialed
8579690 its no good firebrawl either mauvilles had a blackout highly unlikely or someones cut all communication links to the city
8579691 what are you going to do trainer friend can you make the professor come back
8579692 no i cant make her come back but i can warn the others of the anomaly like she asked me to
8579693 you made that perfectly clear when you called me a freak
8579694 im just a simple man trying to make a decent living for himself and his family im out of my element when it comes to genetics and team magma
8579695 and thats supposed to excuse you for what you said
8579696 no its just that when world got to ranch about the massacre at the detachment the surviving officers told us that they couldnt find your bodies amongst the flaming wreckage during those two weeks your mother and i didnt know if you were even alive your mother turned to religion as she always did praying to the legendaries for a miracle but i drowned myself in my work and hoped the truth would come out
8579697 i had a lot of time to myself to think about what i said and did to you before you disappeared i was wrong blaze all i could think about was you and titus and it mattered less and less if you were human or half pokemon you are my son you made st helens name heard throughout the world every time you won in the pokemon league you did your old man and your family proud
8579698 im sorry for what i said back then team magma may have manipulated your genes but you always will be a st helens and my son
8579699 arent you going to say anything to you old man ben
8579700 but theres something else i have tell you and everyone else
8579701 he will be fine its not life threatening or anything like that but he does have some broken bones and hes stable the crash was on the m1 around the leicester nottingham area and while it was a bad crash in the grand scheme of things its very mendable

8579709 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8579710 whether the diocese of new westminster has the right to unilaterally replace these duly elected trustees and move to seize control of the parishes assets is in dispute
8579711 the trustees of both st matthews and st matthias and st luke are meeting and seeking legal advice regarding their response to the diocese
8579712 however we note with interest that the diocese has chosen to act only against the two smaller parishes and not the larger anic parishes st johns shaughnessy and church of the good shepherd in vancouver another concern is that the notice alleging a crisis was signed by the bishop on july 10th but not served on the parishes for six weeks after the lambeth conference had concluded

8579716 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8579717 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8579718 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8579719 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8579720 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8579721 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8579722 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8579723 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8579724 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8579725 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
