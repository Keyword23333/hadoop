4210007 autoline is extremely useful easy to use and flexible making it a deservedly popular utility
4210008 we are extremely pleased that cadalyst has recognized the value offered in the autoline software
4210009 we have put a great deal of effort into making autoline the best way to create and draw linetypes
4210010 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4210011 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4210012 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4210013 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4210014 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4210015 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4210016 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4210017 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4210018 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4210019 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4210020 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4210021 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4210022 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4210023 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4210024 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4210025 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4210026 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4210027 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4210028 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4210029 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4210030 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4210031 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4210032 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4210033 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4210034 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4210035 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4210036 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4210037 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4210038 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4210039 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4210040 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4210041 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4210042 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4210043 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4210044 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4210045 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4210046 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4210047 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4210048 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4210049 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4210050 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4210051 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4210052 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4210053 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4210054 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4210055 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4210056 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4210057 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4210058 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4210059 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4210060 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4210061 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4210062 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4210063 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4210064 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4210065 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4210066 shes our asian player shes got a fine personality and is truly gorgeous
4210067 she can make a contribution to our countries friendship and by supporting her we can do a little too at the very least if we dont cheer for her that would hurt our friendship
4210068 id feel quite honoured if im able to do that
4210069 lots of chinese friends cheered for me it made me very happy to hear their voices
4210070 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up with the jail psychiatrist
4210071 he was doing what every other teenager would be doing
4210072 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4210073 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4210074 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4210075 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4210076 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4210077 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4210078 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4210079 cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4210080 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4210081 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4210082 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4210083 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4210084 anyone who accuses me of reneging on this and that has to ask zimbabweans what they want if i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people of zimbabwe whats wrong with that
4210085 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4210086 how are my backups if my house burns down wheres my data if my work site burns down hows my company
4210087 my guess is for the near future that one wing of the building will probably be unusable
4210088 if chuck schumer hadnt endorsed squadron all these endorsements would be totally meaningless
4210089 ordinarily an endorsement from somebody who isnt on the ground doesnt mean crap in a primary
4210090 but in this particular case endorsements became a battle because marty turned around and says great youve got chuck schumer hes endorsing you because you worked for him ive got everybody else
4210091 you could see it as an incumbent fighting for re election like it matters like marty should have two years ago or you could call it desperation i dont know that its desperation i think its taking someone seriously like you always should
4210092 all us plebian types are supporting connor he stands for the right things and hes a regular guy
4210093 this poll also serves as great motivation where we are ranked
4210094 in the 1930s we had mass unemployment but we didnt have unemployment during the war if you can have full employment by killing germans we can have full employment by building hospitals by building schools recruiting nurses recruiting teachers
4210095 your new national health service begins on the 5 th of july what is it and how do you get it it will provide you with all medical dental and nursing care everyone rich or poor man or child can use it or part of it there are no charges except for a few exceptional items there are no insurance qualifications but it is not a charity you are paying for it mainly as taxpayers and it will relieve your money worries in times of illness
4210096 if thatcher or blair said im going to dismantle the national health service
4210097 we dont want people to be educated healthy and confident because they would get out of control
4210098 we cannot step back and let this president escape accountability
4210099 dear gd what the fuck is this i think my chest is being ripped apart my radioactive zombies
4210100 they drink it all the time all the time they love this stuff try some more it grows on you
4210101 please for the love of gd have mercy they drink this all the time
4210102 well interestingly enough i was living in belgrade during that 5 months i mentioned during 9 11
4210103 what we did is file a brief based on the due process the court should allow thats all
4210104 we should have some continuity of how we operate in west virginia
4210105 it is hurting us and hurting us for creating opportunities taking care of our citizens properly
4210106 i think you ought to keep politics out of the legal system when a case is being litigated
4210107 if you have a question about it go about it in a different way if he wants to try to influence the courts to do something he should not do it through the venue of the case thats before them he should do it before or after
4210108 all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not whither deep roots are not reached by the frost from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king

4210117 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
4210118 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
4210119 she gives us her vision but not her positions unlike hillary she doesnt push a policy agenda her stump speech offers more of a world view she speaks wistfully about the america that produced a hard working man like her father sadly about the country today conservatives tend to focus on this aspect and ecstatically about the future we know she wants us to elect her husband but we suspect she wants something from us personally
4210120 we know shes opinionated and we suspect we havent heard them all she is fiercely public about being fiercely private she is neither the shrewish lady in pantsuits hillary nor the pretty if also practical accessory that generations of political wives have been and so the stacks of profiles and puff pieces about the striking would be first lady have to make do with scraps of information about her diet her health and her favorite things wrapping up the michelle paradox in the comforting costume of celebrity so as a service we gathered and parsed the available information and diligently footnoted our sources to answer all the questions you may have about michelle but might be a little you know too scared to ask
4210121 our fuel costs have more than doubled in the past year
4210122 in order to manage through this unprecedented fuel challenge we have to take action to both control costs and increase our revenue
4210123 these reductions are the direct result of our extraordinary fuel costs and the necessary actions we must take to right size our airline and eliminate unprofitable flying
4210124 this is a temporary service fee to partially offset our fuel costs as fuel comes down we will re visit this decision
4210125 in addition to helping offset our extraordinary fuel prices these fee increases also better align our costs with providing these services
4210126 we expect these three incremental revenue enhancing measures to generate 250 million to 300 million a year which will help ease the burden of these record high oil prices
4210127 the new generation boeing aircraft we have ordered are among the most fuel efficient and will help maintain etihads fleet as one of the youngest and greenest in the sky
4210128 the size of our order also mirrors the rising prominence of the middle east and its increasing emergence as a new focal point of global aviation offering the fastest air links for travelers and freight forwarders
4210129 we count etihad as an outstanding world class customer and we congratulate the airline on its remarkable growth

4210140 the 777 freighter completed the scheduled three hour inaugural flight with no airplane performance related issues
4210141 the only issue was a data communication problem between the airplane and the telemetry room at boeing field
4210142 this is the moment that thousands of boeing employees have worked towards in the design build and test of the 777 freighter the airplane handled perfectly
4210143 being at the controls of a commercial airplane on its maiden flight is a rare and unique opportunity and it was a great day
4210144 im very proud of our 777 team and what theyve accomplished with this airplane
4210145 by working together with our customers and suppliers we have built the best possible new cargo airplane i couldnt be more pleased
4210146 it looks like the fairing came off no big deal
4210147 we are committed to the advancement of nigerian aviation through the utilization of the most modern and reliable airplanes available today

4210151 at lufthansa we are committed to a balance between commercial success environment and business policies oriented toward sustainability

4210153 on behalf of everyone at expressjet airlines i would like to express our gratitude to the communities that provided such a warm welcome and were always supportive of our branded service
4210154 if we had any other choice we would not take this difficult action however rising fuel prices has made the operation impossible to sustain
4210155 police departments are so much more successful when we have the support and help of the public

4210165 they gave me a platform for a guy that was an average quarterback to be a broadcaster for 12 years whenever you do something for 12 years whether its marriage or job or family youre drawn to it so those people treated me great and i have no qualms about leaving it at the time i needed to do some other things but these last five months for me have probably been as peaceful as i have had in a long time and this is the longest ive been without work for a while so it was time to go back and get a job and fortunately with opensports ive got the beginning of something special and this is something ive been looking forward to for a long time
4210166 yes ive told him that youve called before when you left the last message he said that hed call you back

4210169 in spite of extraordinary pressure to do otherwise the archbishop of canterbury has managed to achieve his stated goal of a lambeth conference of reflection rather than resolutions
4210170 the long predicted coup d tat that was going to emerge from this lambeth conference and vote the americans and canadians out of the anglican communion failed to materialize there is much to be grateful for in that
4210171 tsy tanteraka ny faniriana hanilika ny amerikana sy kanadiana izay efa nisy nanomana hatry ny ela fa ho atao taminity lambeth ity betsaka no tokony hankasitrahana azy aminizay

4210174 o leo encheu os olhos do dirigente do wolfsburg nem tanto por ter marcado o gol de empate mas por sua seguran a na zaga
4210175 primeiramente temos que nos concentrar no atl tico mg o primeiro desafio que teremos pela frente mas claro que temos que fazer proje es mesmo garantindo que o fluminense n o ser rebaixado com 44 pontos um time escapa do risco de rebaixamento e por isso vamos precisar de mais 28 pontos ou seja m dia de um e meio por jogo logo o empate ser quase sempre ruim para n s s vai servir em um jogo muito complicado fora de casa ou num cl ssico muito disputado
4210176 ainda tenho mais uns dias antes da partida e ainda cedo para fazer qualquer tipo de progn stico vou continuar trabalhando com empenho
4210177 n o devemos encarar este jogo como se fosse f cil devido goleada sofrida pelas norueguesas
4210178 com a equipe completa venceu estados unidos e nova zel ndia
4210179 tem um estilo de jogo parecido com o da alemanha fisicamente forte e tem jogadoras altas
4210180 nos ltimos tempos perdi partidas que antes n o perdia n o estou em meu melhor n vel preciso treinar mais e tamb m parar um pouco
4210181 j n o est ao meu alcance mas james jogou muito bem e me alegro por ele
4210182 o pedido de compensa o do chelsea football club referente quebra de um contrato que foi assinado entre as duas partes no dia 12 de agosto de 2003 foi parcialmente aceito
4210183 o jogador adrian mutu ter de pagar a quantia de 17 173 990 euros ao chelsea football club
4210184 esta uma decis o importante para o futebol n o apenas a drc nos garantiu uma quantia monet ria significativa mas a decis o tamb m reconheceu o efeito prejudicial que os incidentes envolvendo as drogas t m no futebol e as responsabilidades que temos nesta rea
4210185 acredito que est tudo resolvido o ltimo empecilho que t nhamos j foi resolvido que era a relut ncia do treinador em liberar o jogador mas uma reuni o fez com que o simeone aceitasse liber lo
4210186 ele est muito animado para jogar no flamengo na argentina a press o dos barra bravas maior acredito que ele fica at aliviado vindo jogar no brasil
4210187 disputar uma final ol mpica seria impressionante conseguir uma medalha j seria um feito
4210188 i wanted an older person im the oldest kid yeah i need someone up to my level ricks almost there
4210189 its kept him busy which is a really good thing because when lukes busy lukes not getting intro trouble
4210190 ive noticed hes become more generous and hes more kind and thoughtful to others including myself so thats pretty prideful to notice those kinds of things
4210191 estamos conversando bastante para ajustar o nosso jogo contra advers rios fortes como a noruega o importante n o oscilar muito durante a partida
4210192 o desgaste dessa seq ncia de jogos muito pesado entre um jogo e outro temos que recuperar as jogadoras
4210193 eles tem uma jogadora muito boa a camisa 10 n o sei dizer o nome dela mas uma jogadora com quem temos de ter cuidado a camisa 4 tamb m joga bem ainda vamos assistir a um v deo da ltima partida delas para estudarmos mais
4210194 n o podemos descuidar da marca o dessas duas em momento algum
4210195 contra a nig ria melhorou n s tamb m fizemos todos os gols no primeiro tempo mas n o deixamos a peteca cair no segundo continuamos indo pra cima e criando chances de gol n o foi como contra a cor ia do norte e foi melhor do que contra a alemanha na estr ia essa evolu o animadora
4210196 ela viu que ela estava errada e conversou com as demais jogadoras ela tem que entender que naquele momento eu precisava tir la de campo para mudar o jogo acho que ela conseguiu assimilar isso e se arrependeu do que fez

4210479 eight years ago i left my civil service job as director of the uk anti drug co ordination unit i went partly because i was sick of having to implement policies that i knew and my political masters knew were unsupported by evidence yesterday after a surreal flurry of media requests referring to a blog i wrote that questioned the wisdom of the uks drug policies i found myself in the thick of the debate again and i was sorry to discover that the terms hadnt changed a bit i was being interviewed on the bbc world service and after i tried to explain why i believe that drugs should be decriminalised the person representing the other side of the argument pointed out that drugs are terrible that they destroy lives now i am a deeply boring undruggy person myself and i think the world would be a better place without drugs but i think that we must live in the world as it is and not as we want it to be and so my answer was yes i know that drugs are terrible im not saying that drugs should be decriminalised because it would be fun if we could all get stoned with impunity im saying that weve tried minimising harm through a draconian legal policy it is now clear that enforcement and supply side interventions are largely pointless they havent worked unfortunately evidence is still not a major component in our policy take cannabis when i was in the anti drug unit the moves towards making it a class c drug began and i hoped that our position on drugs was finally moving in a rational direction but then gordon brown ignored his scientific advisers to make it a class b again it was a decision that pandered to the instincts of the tabloids and it made no sense whatsoever

4210553 weve done all the hard work on sunday monday and tuesday and as coaches the real challenge is to take the team to the same level as they were in auckland
4210554 wed like to bring those levels off shore and put it on a tractor to newlands
4210555 this group the present team has the heart to do it or even surpass it it takes a great team to consistently perform at the highest level weve prepared the team well and from our experiences weve told them what to expect
4210556 weve done a lot of homework weve worked hard and now the players have the responsibility to perform on the field we the coaches trust that the players will actually to do the job weve had a good week and now the players will have to put it the hard work out on the park on saturday
4210557 the new zealand people have put great expectations on us but we have our own expectations we are pretty hard on ourselves
4210558 in the past we took into account that players needed a break and weve always had a large pool of players who could all perform at a very high level
4210559 it was easy to make changes under those conditions but this team has had a weeks break so it was great that we could pick the same time
4210560 its really healthy for us to have so much support here in cape town we love it
4210561 what has happened is that the majority of people in terms of citizens have shown that they support the closing of the scorpions even in terms of the number of organisations

4210563 not only will simons head the coaching of the senior amateur team but he will also guide and liaise with the age group wp representative team coaches as well as serve as the convener of selectors for the senior wp amateur team
4210564 this is a huge benefit for the development of coaching in wpca
4210565 what more can you say about a person like eric simons well respected a great servant of cricket in the wp having played for 17 years and still passionate about returning to amateur cricket to share his knowledge and experience with not only players but with wp age group coaches as well
4210566 i am happy to be back and involved with western province cricket and i look forward to work with the western province team which im sure will be a rewarding experience
4210567 by tapping into the knowledge and experience of cricket leaders and legends like eric it will help the alignment throughout our ranks so that the players and coaches we produce going forward will be made ready for the new franchise system
4210568 we returned to the studio to record an album that says something about where weve been and also how weve evolved as a band over the last few years
4210569 the theme for the record is weve got to go through the worst times in life to appreciate the best times in life
4210570 the one two explosive punch of wasteland and the single whos going home with you tonight provide fans with the heavy and driving trapt the tracks are some of the best tracks of the bands career and are instantly memorable
4210571 we decided to create our own unique social networking site for trapt fans because of our frustration with myspace
4210572 its simply a way for us to eliminate the middle man or third wheel so to speak
4210573 in this instance myspace wasnt driving enough traffic to us while we continued to drive fan traffic towards them the read between the lines here is clear
4210574 in an effort to keep shareholders informed of the progress of the company i invite all shareholders to contact me with any questions they might have this will only be temporary as we will in short time have an investors relation unit all setup to raise investor awareness and answer any questions we are still in progress on the cleanup of the company but will be able to update shareholders again shortly i look forward to hearing from everyone
4210575 its not just music for the united states its world music
4210576 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
4210577 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
4210578 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
4210579 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
4210580 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
4210581 given the fact that our quarterly and annual reports have not shown the increase in sales revenue we expected to achieve over the past 12 months we feel an explanation to our stockholders is in order at the same time we would like to update our stockholders as to the companys state of affairs
4210582 during the past 18 months we have concentrated on the following areas
4210583 certain original equipment manufacturers oems which have been under evaluation and review for some time will bring our product in as either optional or mandatory factory installation we are also well along in the evaluation process and in certain instances with initial deliveries with
4210584 it became apparent a few years ago that it would be necessary to concentrate on the above selected accounts which could bring larger volume
4210585 however once these evaluations are closed the potential is significant
4210586 based on the strength of these contracts as well as the successful results of the aforementioned evaluations we believe the larger accounts are close to making a decision in our favor and we will make further disclosures as events develop
4210587 given the amount of time necessary for extensive and rigorous testing our product is required to undergo when working through different levels of a major oem it has been difficult to raise funding as results are long term however recent events in the economy have allowed us to overcome this obstacle to allow us to move forward with greater activity and acceptance
4210588 the dramatic increase in the price of oil in the last several months has now begun to open new doors
4210589 please keep in mind it is not just the savings in oil consumption but the application of green technology and its contribution to a cleaner environment that is beginning to attract more companies and garner attention from end users as consumers become more aware of the role refined oil plays in almost every aspect of our lives we believe they will begin to demand the companies they do business with act in a responsible manner toward the environment

4210610 kleine kinderen horen niet te spelen op roltapijten de ouders zitten vaak aan de gate te wachten voor een half uur of langer kinderen vervelen zich gaan spelen op de rolbanden en dan ontstaat het grootste risico
4210611 we verzamelen bewijzen tegen het georgische leger dat burgers heeft aangevallen
4210612 we hebben de indruk dat ze enkel en alleen osseten wilden doden
4210613 we gaan ze aan de georgi rs teruggeven maar we hebben geen contact met hen we gaan door met tijdelijke begrafenissen

4210618 i am delighted to meet with the council today to discuss important local and national issues and to have the opportunity to meet young people who are involved in the duke of edinburgh curriculum for excellence pilot
4210619 taking part in projects such as this helps young people develop their personal and social potential and makes an important contribution to active citizenship active communities and social inclusion
4210620 the visit to queen margaret academy highlighted the participation of young people in south ayrshire in the duke of edinburghs award pilot project that enhances their existing skills and teaches them new ones the experience helps to make them well rounded citizens to take part in community activities and to use their leisure time constructively
4210621 in september 2006 a u s district court judge ruled that the principal had violated currys first amendment rights a three judge panel for the 6th circuit u s court of appeals reversed the that decision
4210622 arcosanti is both a success and a failure a failure in that it is less than what its founder had hoped it would be yet an extraordinary success in that it is actually there inhabited and changing peoples lives
4210623 its greatest success has been its prescience in the field of architecture and the environment
4210624 this is not the perfect arcology but its a place to experiment
4210625 it is designed to human size phoenix is designed to car size
4210626 it took a lot of labor to build these walls
4210627 i dont know if they charmed them or drugged them
4210628 but their tails are down so they arent stressed this is real storytelling
4210629 with all the issues we have today with chronic illnesses and our children he serves as a real example of modern day medicine
4210630 he has really made it a priority to practice what he teaches
4210631 not only how the environment is affecting our health but how humans the medical industry affect the environment

4210635 the industry wants to be treated on the basis of a level playing field with other countries around the world
4210636 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4210637 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4210638 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit
4210639 we believe you can develop the resource while protecting the environment
4210640 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oilsands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
4210641 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
4210642 which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

4210653 women who choose to abort an unwanted pregnancy may experience feelings of grief and loss but there is no evidence that a single abortion causes significant mental health problems a panel of the american psychological association reported after two years of study
4210654 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4210655 the credibility of a new report on the mental health effects of abortion from the american psychological association is tarnished by the fact that the lead author dr
4210656 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
4210657 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
4210658 as the british economy slows down perhaps heading towards recession there is bound to be a serious impact on jobs
4210659 ministers have been totally complacent in insisting they have found a permanent solution to the problem of boom and bust in the economy
4210660 until now low unemployment has helped sustain the belief that there might be a soft landing in the housing market without large scale repossessions
4210661 but it is now clear that a prolonged slowdown is going to reproduce many of the bad conditions of the early 1990s
4210662 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4210663 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4210664 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4210665 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4210666 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4210667 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4210668 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4210689 onze relatie strandde kort nadat we in 2006 remigreerden vanuit bonaire na een pauze van twee jaar hebben we elkaar weer gevonden sinds valentijnsdag dit jaar vormen we weer cht een gezin
4210690 na een absurd drukke periode heb ik de afgelopen jaren bewust gekozen voor de rust
4210691 ik heb deze tijd gebruikt om helemaal tot mezelf gekomen ik ontdekte dat weglopen voor jezelf en een ander de schuld geven van je eigen tekortkomingen je niet verder brengen met deze persoonlijke groei kwam er ook weer ruimte voor mijn liefde voor frans n mijn liefde voor het acteren vanaf begin september ben ik te zien in de film panman rhythm of the palms
4210692 frans en ik leefden vanaf het begin van onze relatie in de hoogste versnelling ik geloof dat we na onze eerste nacht samen meteen samenwoonden
4210693 zeven maanden later was ik zwanger bovendien woonden we nooit langer dan n jaar op dezelfde plek het was een vreselijk onrustige tijd
4210694 maar de horeca daar was niet wat we ervan verwachtten na elf maanden keerden we terug naar nederland
4210695 als stel kregen we het moeilijk en een paar maanden na onze remigratie gingen frans en ik uit elkaar al dat rennen en vliegen had zich gewroken we waren elkaar onderweg kwijtgeraakt
4210696 ik ontdekte dat ik vluchtgedrag vertoonde ging moeilijke situaties liever uit de weg ook ging ik inzien dat een ander de schuld geven je niet verder brengt de neiging om mijn leven drastisch om te gooien zit gewoon in mij
4210697 opportunity the rest of the way to make some additional decisions see some additional guys and get more information going into next year
4210698 weve had that happen they just stop working and die off
4210699 were trying to understand what is going on inside this brain material that could have direct implications for human health
4210700 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
4210701 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
4210702 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
4210703 el golden slam uuf antes de pensar en eso tengo que ganar tres grand slam
4210704 no lo entiendo a federer se supone que es un tipo inteligente
4210705 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4210706 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4210707 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4210708 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4210709 the sex and the city people are fun but its important to remember that its entertainment
4210710 ill take samanthas kim cattralls character body any day she looks fantastic but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
4210711 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4210712 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4210713 shes inspiring but shes not going to keep me going
4210714 it has to be my own decision and own choice its easy when you have a lot going on to make excuses it comes down to your own personal dedication
4210715 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4210716 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4210717 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4210718 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4210719 i think following the olympics there will be a crackdown in xinjiang like never before
4210720 if you dont believe in the christian god then youre not american
4210721 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210722 what a mockery that after five years detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
4210723 this is the first time any of us have tracked like this
4210724 most of these guys have only done live recording if anything at all
4210725 almost all of the albums weve done in the past have been live recordings on a sound stage
4210726 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210727 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210728 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
4210729 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210730 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
4210731 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
4210732 any measure by the european union ahead of the end of talks between iran and the five security council veto holders plus germany will be unacceptable
4210733 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210734 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210735 this magnificent sail powered ship serves as a reminder of our nations and this citys sea faring heritage
4210736 along with the marine corps the coast guard is a partner in implementing the nations maritime strategy
4210737 as a matter of policy we do not discuss current or future ships movements however i can tell you that reports of an alleged naval blockade of iran are false
4210738 we routinely rotate deployed naval forces in the uscentcom area of responsibility to maintain our commitment to promoting security and stability in the region
4210739 massive us and european armada is reported heading for the region
4210740 comprises a us navy super carrier battle group and is accompanied by an expeditionary carrier battle group a british royal navy carrier battle group and a french nuclear hunter killer submarine
4210741 also reported heading toward iran is another nuclear powered carrier the uss ronald reagan and its carrier strike group seven the uss iwo jima amphibious assault ship the royal navy aircraft carrier hms ark royal and a number of french warships including the nuclear hunter killer submarine amethyste
4210742 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4210743 esto tiene que tener trascendencia para que toda la ciudadan a pueda hacer valer sus derechos

4210745 i finally realized if i dont have my health i have nothing
4210746 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
4210747 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything

4210749 who knows what will happen in a year from now
4210750 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
4210751 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
4210752 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye
4210753 above everything else jennifer is looking for stability and loyalty in a relationship she still is hurting from losing brad pitt to angelina jolie even after all this time
4210754 for two years and now in my 20th trip to china weve gone through a lot of materials and a lot of training to get to this point
4210755 youre talking about a country not familiar with the game and when youre trying to make mlb quality fields its difficult
4210756 were talking about whats first base whats home plate when we first started second base was higher than the pitchers mound they drained it like a soccer pitch because thats what they were used to we said we dont do it that way water would have flowed across the mound to the plate
4210757 no doubt about it there was a big communications blip on learning the words what is the chinese word for batters box for home plate
4210758 i first came here in october 06 and then came maintenance training for the volunteers
4210759 out of the more than one hundred volunteers maybe 10 of them can actually throw a baseball theyre volunteering because its the olympics youre starting from square one
4210760 we got some great riviera bermuda seed donated from the usa
4210761 and then just this past friday we got 35 tons of diamond pro soil conditioner it came on a slow boat to china literally it arrived the day of the first practice you have to put it on for the stability of this clay
4210762 the mound material had to be shipped from san diego the mound and home plate clay is the same as on petco park
4210763 its beautiful theyve done a heck of a job to make these big league fields
4210764 ive been in a lot of venues and this is first class all the way i tip my hat to the chinese
4210765 els nics que us heu danar de barcelona sou vosaltres
4210766 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and we never batted an eye we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is brought right back in our own front yards
4210767 no no no not god bless america god damn america
4210768 even though this is a really hard time i have my family my friends and my fans to support me and thats really helpful
4210769 im using it in a positive way and when i come out i cant wait to start my new life and be even stronger than i am now
4210770 that being pregnant didnt make her feel less of a man and that the moral of her story is that wanting to have a biological child is neither a male nor female desire but a human desire
4210771 we will have to desist from giving the forces an excuse and justification to open fire
4210772 kashmiri people have become used to suffer violence and that is why we dont answer violence with violence he said
4210773 the forces rain bullets on unarmed civilians which is the worst violation of human rights
4210774 we will withstand every form of oppression but will not compromise with our movement
4210775 india had not succeeded to suppress our movement with force in the past and could no be able to do so in the future
4210776 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting upa can plead for organisation like simi why cant we stand with the masses
4210777 thanks also for being a friend of me youre such a precious friend and a friend to be cherish forever i would like to pass this to all my friends in my list just feel free to copy paste and post in your site god bless you all and have a great day
4210778 vi ser hur de fogar sig och drar sig tillbaka till en position d r de kan l mna p ett lugnt s tt
4210779 dialogue is the only way to resolve the present crisis
4210780 unfortunate behavior of police has aggravated the situation to enter the houses of the people during the night and try to harass the women and children in some areas in srinagar and hurl abuses in the name of kashmiri leaders gives a clear understanding of the mindset of managers of governors rule
4210781 the dictatorial arrogance of the operator of misrule in kashmir is seriously hurting and further alienating the people
4210782 the sad behavior of police with the media persons and point blank range killing of one young media person two days back has its impact on the functioning of press and media
4210783 we will launch a jail bharo movement if there is no positive response from the centre to our demands
4210784 we have been raising this issue in a civilized manner for the last two and a half years but today people of kashmir are on roads supporting our demand
4210785 wir bieten schon seit jahren vielen jahren qualifizierungen f r p dagogische fachkr fte an seit zwei jahren etwa sind auch angebote f r die ogs hinzugekommen

4210826 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body add your comments

4210835 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4210840 he grabbed her and sexually assaulted her and would not stop
4210841 extraordinary but indicated bail would be revisited at a later hearing
4210842 normal routine just hanging out working out running and enjoying good baseball
4210843 definitely looked like that ball pitched to damian easley hit his bat but it hit him in the helmet that was definitely a game changer but it was a good game to the very end
4210844 i was right there watching from the dugout he was definitely safe it was a tough break what more can i say
4210845 based on quality starts standards six innings and three runs do not always get the job done so i am always going out there to go nine innings i am trying to learn each time i go out there and keep the team in the ball game
4210846 last year was definitely a whirlwind the whole season was especially coming up in that situation those first three starts were really different i guess you could say i got ejected against the phillies for hitting chase utley then i got my first win then i got to face barry bonds and the giants when he was going for that home run record it is something i will never forget and it was just a great experience i didnt want to give it up the record home run but i also did not want to pitch around him so i thought of him as just a regular batter and i am not saying barry bonds is a regular batter i just tried to keep it in the back of my mind not think too much of it that he was going for the record
4210847 yeah i got ejected from my first big league game
4210848 i am pretty sure everybody who was a friend with me knew that i got ejected
4210849 yeah and i can have some friends tell you too they werent too happy
4210850 my dad has been a big influence on my life especially baseball hes been my coach since i started playing when i was six years old basically i have been a late bloomer you might say in high school i did not get my feet wet until by junior or senior year then i really didnt get scouted that much for college so i went to siena college up in albany new york a small d 1 school my freshman and sophomore years i went through my growing pains then my junior year i had my breakout year and i broke a couple of school records
4210851 i got noticed by a couple of teams and the nationals picked me up in their first year so once again when i came up with the nationals my first professional season i was getting my feet wet in 05 amp 06 definitely it was a humbling experience i am starting to get a little comfortable right now and having a lot more fun
4210852 it feels great to be a big league pitcher has been a dream probably since i was your age a young child asked the question its a dream come true and i feel blessed every single day
4210853 listen to your parents stay in school and do a lot of hard work
4210854 the yankees definitely the yankees although i went to some mets games when i was younger the yankees were definitely the team i liked the most ever since 96 that is the team i really started to go to baseball heaven with
4210855 well they were pretty good four straight world series championships
4210856 they were pretty good its probably why i liked them so much
4210857 andy pettite and i loved don mattingly but he left by then 1996 95 was his last year that whole team i loved bernie williams all those guys definitely paved the way for my baseball career
4210858 yes its either the yankees or the mets or jets or giants or islander or rangers then you have the knicks but they are struggling right now
4210859 you can be a baseball fan and in the subway series you definitely have to follow one but if the mets were in the playoffs you have to have some new york pride
4210860 i didnt want to be a front runner when the football giants won because i would watch football during the season and they were not playing too well but i am a giants fan and i am a rangers fan one of my friends has season tickets so i went to a lot of rangers games
4210861 when the rangers won the stanley cup in 94 thats when i started to become a huge rangers fan but i have kind of dwindled off lately i have started to get back into it during the off season
4210862 my first start this year was at busch stadium the fans there are great not as great as you guys but they really have baseball knowledge that place is unbelievable i am going to wrigley field on an upcoming road trip and i am really excited i get to miss philly because of the rainout in colorado and now i get wrigley and i am glad to miss philly because i wont have to get booed chuckling and i get to pitch at wrigley which is one of the best baseball parks i think
4210863 i hope not but i dont think those fans forget
4210864 i have no problem with them being mean to mean because they love their phillies but being mean to my family that is just not right and they were definitely mean to my family in my debut
4210865 but they just want to win and they know what they want i cant blame them for that
4210866 well we had the battle of the beltways so i think that is building a little by little any nl east team thats competing i think is considered a rival
4210867 i think it is a mix of everybody everybody brings something to the table right now willie harris is definitely gives a lot of life ronnie belliard also does all those veteran guys that have been around for some time they mold us young people young players and its great to have those types of guys in the clubhouse i think we have a great clubhouse because everyone seriously gets along its just a great clubhouse
4210868 that play he made tuesday night was unbelievable it was awesome to watch
4210869 yes he is dedicated to going out there and getting the job done you can see it when he plays its just great to watch charlie when you see a guy like that and i always see him in the clubhouse early he always watches video he always has a mindset and an approach to how hes going to go against the starting pitcher that night he is a great example for the young players hes prepared to play every day
4210870 exactly and you really have to watch him to learn there are a bunch of guys like that they all get there early and work hard no matter what whether they are struggling or not they go out there and know what they have to do and keep on battling
4210871 there is only so much tv you can watch you learn the most in your losses you learn some things from your wins but you learn the most from when you lose definitely you want to be around guys that have been in that same spot and you watch the game i was out in the third or fourth inning that day and i just didnt feel like being in the clubhouse i just wanted to still be out there cheering the team on hopefully we can come back but i definitely learn more from sitting there on the bench taking in everything
4210872 hey i know i was off what did you see
4210873 not really its just based on what he has gone through we are such different pitchers he is more of a power guy i have to work on my command but its just based on how i react after a start and how to forget about what just happened move on and that is the toughest part not to dwell on bad things but to improve and just get better tim redding has really helped me out with that
4210874 yeah that was the first game i ever threw like that i just woke up that morning and said to himself that looks like a good idea against these guys i went out there and threw it i kind of got away from it in the last couple of games but i still got that slider working so i am continuing to move forward with what works
4210875 thats just adapting thats just something you need to do because these hitters are good
4210876 there is a ton but one of my good friends craig stammen hes climbing the ladder too he started at potomac single a and now he is in columbus aaa hes a hard worker great kid there are a lot of different guys marco estrada is another pitcher and corey van allen i have never played with him but hes one of my best friends too he is definitely a great lefty pitcher coming up through the ranks there are a lot of guys and i need a couple of minutes to really think about it
4210877 the usual guys the great guys of the game albert pujols although i have not faced him in situation yet lance berkman is tough ian stewart is tough recently chuckling chipper jones all those big name guys they are tough and thats what they get paid for because that is what they do they have been doing it for years
4210878 yes that start was a little tough to take that one pitch and he stewart hit it a long way game tying home run you have to give credit to the hitter but its tough when you have one of your very last pitches be a home run
4210879 yeah you can have those start and still get the win thats why i dont really concentrate on wins and losses because it doesnt really say how you did that game but wins are great ill take a couple more wins
4210880 its too early to say about me those guys are just great 300 wins is unbelievable 3000 strikeouts is unbelievable those guys are what i strive to be some day
4210881 yes definitely to pitch against john smoltz when he was going for his 3000th strikeout was definitely cool then i met tom glavine and he even signed an autograph for me those guys are just great in games and its fun to watch them pitch
4210882 i love it just because my family was there people who had not had the chance to see me in dc they all came out and it was great for them i just happy for them to be there and see me pitch
4210883 my best pitch is a strike everyone laughing but that is the best pitch in the game seriously a strike is the best pitch in the game but a fastball is definitely what i live by
4210884 i was most shocked moving up to double a i was most nervous moving up to double a just because i had never been above single a ball that was definitely the most nerve racking i was the most nervous then
4210885 dont get me wrong that i was not nervous getting the call to the big leagues aaa manager john stearns called me into his office and told me i was going to pitch in philly i was definitely very nervous but there was talk about me going up so i was mentally building myself up but when i got called up to double a i had no clue and they the organization just threw it on me and i said wow

4210919 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance

4210971 whats this i hear about the russkies invading georgia how dare they bring their armies on our soil and drop bombs on innocent people
4210972 and whats with all these american politicians sitting around doing nothing but talking
4210973 i hear the russians already have taken over south ossetia and were very close to gori
4210974 for the life of me i cannot comprehend why while all this chaos is going on president bush was over in china at the olympics and there he was as big as life hugging russian prime minister dictator vladimir putin
4210975 what was he doing trying to get another look at the mans soul i could have told him that its been a long time since putin has had a soul if he ever had one at all
4210976 and old john mccain with emphasis on old has been doing a lot of talking but saying absolutely nothing yada yada yada he knows he voted to send our troops over to iraq which is why the russian army can act like gen shermans troops going into atlanta during the civil war
4210977 anyway he was on vacation in hawaii being over there on that little island he surely should have remembered what happened when pearl harbor was bombed yet hes over there working on a tan when the russkies are marching through georgia as easy as whistling dixie
4210978 im getting sick and tired of the so called leaders who do nothing but talk
4210979 the least they could do is start rounding up those second amendment freaks who have just been given reassurance by the supreme court that they can have all the guns they want lets see if they are truly ready to use their handguns and rifles to defend their country
4210980 by the way did you hear bush say it was wrong for russia to go out and invade a sovereign nation like georgia
4210981 doesnt he know that georgia rejoined the union after the war and furthermore if he really believes invasion is wrong how come he was not thinking that way before he ordered american troops into the sovereign nation of iraq
4210982 what do you mean the russians didnt attack inside the united states
4210983 no wait no matter where georgia is the russians were wrong in launching these brutal attacks and the whole world needs to denounce them for that
4210984 unfortunately because the bush administration has squandered this countrys worldwide influential capital by its ill fated war on iraq this president doesnt have the moral authority to speak on this issue hes lost all credibility
4210985 do you really think the soul less putin is going to listen to him much less do what he says
4210986 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of the impacts on species
4210987 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
4210988 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
4210989 i want the people of your country to know the american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free
4210990 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
4210991 the cause of burmas freedom democracy and human rights was poignantly served but whether mr bush and his wifes gestures will make any difference on the ground is doubtful
4210992 twenty years have gone by and everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
4210993 described being shown to many men before being chosen and sold
4210994 every day we are busy with hardware and software as our ammunition any way we can but theres never any answer
4210995 i wish there was a magic wand to wave there isnt on the other hand the people that are listening to your radio broadcast has got to know that the president of the united states and a lot of other people in america are concerned and care about how they live and want them to be free
4210996 whether that happens tomorrow or not is doubtful i make no promises to your listeners except that well continue to try

4210999 the problem is likely with the low level software and the chipsets

4211001 this is exactly what happened a few years ago when the first iphones went on sale its something that will be worked out
4211002 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4211003 ultimately in a minority parliament to get things done you have to have the support of at least one of the other opposition parties
4211004 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation i think mr dion will have to make up his mind

4211008 indian team is on an upswing they played football reminiscent of what india used to play two decades ago from sunil chhetri to gouramangi everybody played well
4211009 i have not seen india beating a strong team by that margin in any final it seemed the players have shed the fear factor of playing in big tournaments full credit to the players and the coach
4211010 we are going to play the likes of south korea japan and saudi arabia so we need preparations houghton is doing a great job now and he should be given another term or extend his current contract till 2011
4211011 by scoring three goals in first 25 minutes indians showed the domination they charmed everybody full credit to coach houghton
4211012 indian football has finally come of age by qualifying for the asian cup after 1984 houghton and the players have done a great job india have found their combination right this batch of footballers should stay in the team for at least two years now they should continue on the same momentum
4211013 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill
4211014 it was a very good session and it was very intense we had fitness drills too and the practice went off well
4211015 i got along well with all the players though there is no specific role assigned to me i am ready to play at any number in the batting order i know i will have to adjust to the situation of the game depending on the kind of role i am given by the team management i will try to do well if i get a chance to play

4211078 must imagine himself in the center of the mandala as an embodiment of the divine figure of perfect buddhahood
4211079 can only be found in the realization of all those qualities which taken all together form the richness of the mandala
4211080 just as one sees ones own reflection in a mirror so the dharmakaya is seen in the mirror of wisdom

4211238 many banks and brokers have announced large losses and more are likely to face financial difficulties as the mortgage crisis spreads
4211239 it is imperative that consumers and investors understand how to use ratings and other data available to make informed decisions about where to deposit and invest their money
4211240 i believe thats my task and im going to do everything i can to win
4211241 a win is 50 plus one so if sen clinton gets over 50 percent shes won the state and you know i dont try to pretend that i enjoy getting 45 percent and thats a moral victory weve lost the state
4211242 what i do believe is that were coming to the end of this process weve won twice as many states weve won the popular vote by fairly substantial margins weve got a very big lead in pledged delegates and we competed win or lose
4211243 we returned to the studio to record an album that says something about where weve been and also how weve evolved as a band over the last few years
4211244 the theme for the record is weve got to go through the worst times in life to appreciate the best times in life
4211245 the one two explosive punch of wasteland and the single whos going home with you tonight provide fans with the heavy and driving trapt the tracks are some of the best tracks of the bands career and are instantly memorable
4211246 we decided to create our own unique social networking site for trapt fans because of our frustration with myspace
4211247 its simply a way for us to eliminate the middle man or third wheel so to speak
4211248 in this instance myspace wasnt driving enough traffic to us while we continued to drive fan traffic towards them the read between the lines here is clear
4211249 given the fact that our quarterly and annual reports have not shown the increase in sales revenue we expected to achieve over the past 12 months we feel an explanation to our stockholders is in order at the same time we would like to update our stockholders as to the companys state of affairs
4211250 during the past 18 months we have concentrated on the following areas
4211251 certain original equipment manufacturers oems which have been under evaluation and review for some time will bring our product in as either optional or mandatory factory installation we are also well along in the evaluation process and in certain instances with initial deliveries with
4211252 it became apparent a few years ago that it would be necessary to concentrate on the above selected accounts which could bring larger volume
4211253 however once these evaluations are closed the potential is significant
4211254 based on the strength of these contracts as well as the successful results of the aforementioned evaluations we believe the larger accounts are close to making a decision in our favor and we will make further disclosures as events develop
4211255 given the amount of time necessary for extensive and rigorous testing our product is required to undergo when working through different levels of a major oem it has been difficult to raise funding as results are long term however recent events in the economy have allowed us to overcome this obstacle to allow us to move forward with greater activity and acceptance
4211256 the dramatic increase in the price of oil in the last several months has now begun to open new doors
4211257 please keep in mind it is not just the savings in oil consumption but the application of green technology and its contribution to a cleaner environment that is beginning to attract more companies and garner attention from end users as consumers become more aware of the role refined oil plays in almost every aspect of our lives we believe they will begin to demand the companies they do business with act in a responsible manner toward the environment
4211258 the question is not if there will be another blackout of the same or larger scale as the one we experienced five years ago it is when it will occur
4211259 lets face it the grid needs a new brain to run its operational body
4211260 without it the grid isnt much better than a scarecrow
4211261 such change could be realized without installing new power lines building new power plants or any other such major investments rather what we must demand is visionary thinking and a willingness to explore new technologies that ensure the safety and efficiency of our electrical grid

4211268 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
4211269 can an airplane on a conveyor belt running in opposite motion to the airplanes tires at the same speed keep the plane from taking off
4211270 a plane is standing on runway that can move some sort of band conveyer the plane moves in one direction while the conveyer moves in the opposite direction this conveyer has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyer to be exactly the same but in opposite direction can the plane take off
4211271 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off

4211283 the ministerial meeting will also focus on further strengthening to the trans tasman trade and economic relationship including the single economic market agenda
4211284 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4211285 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4211286 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers
4211287 the industry wants to be treated on the basis of a level playing field with other countries around the world
4211288 now every other country of the 12 or so nations that i mentioned spends considerable sums of money working with their industry because those countries understand the importance of the car industry to their particular economies the australian industry is no different
4211289 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4211290 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4211291 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit

4211328 het team is nu meer in balans dan toen leon rodgers 11 hier nog speelde
4211329 het zat niet mee we moesten al snel afscheid nemen van diverse spelers soms vallen ze tegen omdat ze niet over de persoonlijkheid beschikken die goed bij eiffeltowers past omdat een nederlandse club nu eenmaal geen geld heeft om spelers overzee te gaan bekijken zijn we sterk afhankelijk van dvds en wat een agent over ze vertelt het zijn lang niet altijd choir boys
4211330 bovendien was travis young maandenlang beperkt inzetbaar tijdens de play offs kon hij slechts sporadisch laten zien wat hij in zijn mars heeft maar ook de religieuze overtuiging van roye berkowitz speelde ons parten kon hij vanwege de sabbat op zaterdagavond niet of nauwelijks spelen dan kwam er t veel werk op de schouders van dean oliver terecht en damone brown speelde in de bekerfinale zijn beste wedstrijd daarna was het over terwijl hij juist een van de spelers was die er had moeten staan
4211331 kees akerboom speelde een sterk seizoen hij was als een van de weinigen een constante factor ook over de progressie die marcel aarts heeft geboekt ben ik heel tevreden hij heeft het na het vertrek van kurtz goed opgepikt hij had weliswaar de steun van brandon griffin die zichzelf altijd volledig geeft maar wanneer zij samen in het veld stonden nam ons scorend vermogen af dan was er inside minder dreiging
4211332 omdat we in vergelijking met de meeste andere teams een behoorlijk budget hebben verwachten mensen dat we altijd winnen was het maar zo simpel geld helpt maar de spelers moeten het op het veld doen wedstrijd na wedstrijd je kunt een kampioenschap niet kopen daarvan zijn genoeg voorbeelden
4211333 a rod verdient evenveel als het spelersbudget van de florida marlins
4211334 240 miljoen dollar dat is vier keer zo veel als de minnesota twins en de pittsburg pirates te besteden hebben sharone wat verdient alex rodriguez per jaar
4211335 a rod verdient 20 miljoen per jaar dat is evenveel als het spelersbudget van de florida marlins de yankees kunnen kopen wie ze willen het is de rijkste profclub van de states
4211336 de eerste vier wedstrijden werden door beide teams dik gewonnen zeker in wedstrijd zes en zeven kwam het er cht op aan toen bleek dat een aantal van onze spelers niet hun gebruikelijke niveau haalde we misten in de slotfase van de zevende wedstrijd bovendien twee volledig open schoten daarentegen speelde teddy gipson the game of his life de teamprestatie van myguide was goed maar door zijn individuele acties wonnen ze de wedstrijd n de titel die fade away driepunter gezien toen hij zich aan een double team ontworstelde ongelooflijk gipson made something out of nothing
4211337 het team is nu meer in balans dan toen leon rodgers hier nog speelde vanaf februari hebben we erg goed gespeeld het hoogtepunt was de uitoverwinning tegen west brabant giants waardoor we alsnog tweede werden we speelden toen erg goed als je ziet hoeveel tegenslag we hebben gehad en we uiteindelijk pas in de allerlaatste wedstrijd van het seizoen de titel hebben verloren dan hebben we het maximale uit het team gehaald komend seizoen zullen we sterker zijn al was het alleen maar omdat andere clubs nu een inhaalslag hebben gemaakt en wij daardoor van een remmende voorsprong zijn verlost

4211342 anti abortion authors cannot restrain themselves from dragging adolf hitler out of the grave a society that accepts abortion we are told is doing what the nazis did when they killed off the handicapped the retarded the gypsies and the jews
4211343 the facts are these the german nazis had strict anti abortion policies for aryans jews were encouraged to abort as part of hitlers racial purity madness strange that right to lifers do not make more of the fact that the pioneer in liberal abortion was not hitler but v i lenin in 1920 the soviet union is not exactly ones ideal of a humanitarian life valuing state either

4211345 using cosmetics is no longer exclusive to gay men makeup is an essential element in mens grooming
4211346 tests of 34 name brand cosmetic products revealed that 80 contained one or more phthalates according to a november report published by the advocacy groups womens environmental network the swedish society for nature conservation and health care without harm phthalates which are linked to reproductive birth defects and developmental toxicity are found in perfumes deodorants and hair care products in which they perform the function of moisturizing dissolving or fixing other ingredients the phthalates are not listed among the ingredients for these products because they are considered proprietary information
4211347 in 2005 a group of toxicologists published a study suggesting that mothers whose urine contained high levels of an important component of plastics were more likely to have male babies with subtly feminized genitals this the first research showing human effects from a group of chemicals known as phthalates infuriated the plastics industry stirred an active controversy among toxicologists and kick started u s legislators into taking steps to ban the substance on thursday with at least eight states contemplating a phthalate ban similar to one california passed last year the u s senate while overhauling the consumer products safety commission included an amendment to ban phthalates from all childrens toys and products hundreds of thousands of tons of phthalates are produced each year and put in plastics used for everything from shower curtains to baby bottle nipples to make them soft and pliable if the amendment added by sen diane feinstein d calif survives conference committee and is signed by president george w bush americans will have the same protection that citizens of the european union have had since 1999 when the eu parliament responded to studies that suggested phthalates might cause harm to baby boys since europe banned the substances from toys theyve been joined by countries like china romania and mexico not usually regarded as ground breakers in public health how is it that the united states which used to set the gold standard for public health regulation has fallen so far behind
4211348 this nurse fran was on her nametag came into my mothers room she closed the door carefully and hugged me she said dont you remember me i said well no i dont she said i was your patient many years ago you saved my life i was in a relationship that was really bad and you told me to do what i needed to do and it all worked out she then turned to my mother and repeated your daughter saved my life if there is anything you need just let me know then she left
4211349 not five minutes after the nurse leaves someone else comes into the room its ann marie starr my stalker
4211350 if she sees me in the grocery store shell start screaming at me i just wait for the manager to throw her out
4211351 she started hassling my mother telling her shed pray for her but given what id done she might have to go to hell anyway my mother begged her to leave but ann marie refused and started yelling about her right to be there
4211352 fran is a good sized woman and she just physically dragged ann marie out of there

4211360 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts obviously its not working now we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track
4211361 we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure

4211406 sadly london just like washington has been captured by the neoconservatives these are not conservatives new or old they are simply warmongers they have misread the history of the twentieth century for them national greatness is measured by military power they are allied to business and other interests that benefit from war they had a fine time during the cold war they were disappointed when this abruptly ended they have since then been lying us into smaller wars all over the world they want a permanent war with islam they look forward to a cold war with china of course now that vladimir putin is in charge of russia they are in love with the idea that the original cold war never really ended and that the warm certainties of their youth can now be revived

4211428 i would refer to this environment as the temperature controlled supply chain not just the cold chain because we work with a variety of temperatures although the 2 to 8 celsius range is used most prevalently with pharmaceuticals and biological products
4211429 are working together to develop supply chain standards including temperature data in the u s so that profiles can be created for lab qualification testing of transport packaging
4211430 guidance for temperature controlled medicinal products maintaining the quality of temperature sensitive medicinal products through the transportation environment
4211431 if you have just been put in charge of temperature controlled distribution this gives you a good overview its a good guide to get you started and develop an understanding of what youre trying to accomplish
4211432 the distribution environment doesnt know a pharmaceutical product from others its just product shipments through their distribution systems when you get into pharmaceuticals and biologics it may be hard to determine damage to the products themselves its one of the criteria you have to establish what constitutes damage to the product
4211433 what gives how come all the young guns are breaking down
4211434 but i think that having nancy pelosi speak is a mistake she is the symbol of the ineffective democrat led congress she is a reminder that democrats would prefer to allow millions of americans to have to choose between food and or work or paying their energy bills she is the voice of the democratic party that refused to even consider having a vote on domestic drilling effectively saying that democrats have no intention of being bi partisan if senator obama is elected
4211435 speaker pelosi has walled off any discussion of domestic drilling for oil she has refused to allow any votes on the subject and according to her most recent comments on larry king she will only consider possibly allowing a vote on domestic drilling if it also includes alternative energy incentives effectively that means that speaker pelosi wants alternative energy to get more money to earn more money for herself the higher the cost for oil the better her alternative energy stocks will do and the american public be damned
4211436 and the only real outcome of these actions by the clintons is weakening of senator obama possibly splitting the democratic party and causing obama to lose that would open the door to senator clinton claiming she could have won and paving the way for her run in 2012 that is unless she cant get the nomination at the dnc its so deceptive it can only be a clinton plan
4211437 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4211438 its only taken her a day to realize that 2143 is over 2118 and that she has lost only a day to recognize that using race and religion as negative attacks has not helped her that every woman in america will not flock to her just because of her gender that taking every position possible on issues like illegal immigrants getting drivers liscences or lying to the public with ireland and bosnia to name a few is not a means to gain votes
4211439 i seen in to the eyes of this man his soul and i like i what i see

4211485 its encouraging that many people are considering changing their plans with regards to holidays this year although its still a concern that so many people are still spending beyond their means
4211486 the relatively easy access to credit in recent years has meant it is now common for people to get into debt to fund expensive holidays and this debt can become a serious burden if its not managed properly
4211487 we live in a culture where we can take many things for granted and it seems to many people that includes holidays but if that involves racking up large debts it might be best to carry on saving and maybe even wait until next year
4211488 sharing is a good way of minimising holiday debts this summer and some people may be able to avoid getting into debt entirely this way
4211489 the credit crunch is putting pressure on most of us at this time and there is the risk that unless you are very careful you could arrive home with potentially unmanageable debts to deal with
4211490 many people book holidays well in advance up to a year in some cases
4211491 but the pressures of the credit crunch and rising costs of living mean that many people may be finding it much harder to pay for their holidays than they anticipated
4211492 we advise anyone in this situation to contact an expert debt adviser who can discuss your situation and help decide the best plan of action there are various debt solutions available to suit different situations including debt management plans debt consolidation loans and ivas choosing the right debt solution could help you cut down your monthly costs and prevent your debts from continuing to grow

4211494 the fact that financials are on the mend is part of whats giving the market buoyancy today
4211495 the only hope that this market has is that with the commodity prices having come down fairly substantially over the last month or so that trend will continue if it continues it will go a long way in helping the fed not have to raise rates
4211496 higher inflation is positive for short term interest rates in general
4211497 but an inflation driven rise in yields wouldnt necessarily be good for the dollar in the medium term
4211498 the market believes weak growth and weakened demand will arrest inflation

4211505 the bush administration backed by congress republican presidential candidate john mccain and most of the us media also adopted a highly uncritical attitude to both the undemocratic and chauvinistic aspects of the saakashvili administration and its growing resemblance to that of the crazed nationalist leader zviad gamsakhurdia in the early 1990s
4211506 we were watching the opening ceremony for the 2000 sydney games and i remember thinking one day i want to be part of that

4211508 i was a teenager back then and i finished eighth i am 23 now i have so much more experience under my belt
4211509 but to be honest everyone will be up for it you can never under estimate anybody when you go into a competition ostaphcuk has been putting in some big throws lately but that wont change the way i approach the competition
4211510 you can never plan to make your biggest throw your last throw
4211511 being world champion doesnt mean much at an olympic games

4211528 the reality is that for clinton much of his time since leaving office has been focused on money
4211529 were you also a bit appalled watching nancy harrington the matronly now former president of salem state college giddily greet the disgraced bill clinton like some goo goo eyed adolescent fawning over her favorite rock star if theres one place this empty vessel ought not to be welcomed its a campus populated by coeds most of whom presumably have been taught not to tolerate the kind of workplace exploitation that became clintons calling card and thats to say nothing about pardoning criminals lying to grand juries grabbing gifts and looting souvenirs

4211532 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4211533 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4211536 it was one of the most profoundly beautiful things ive experienced
4211537 john was a white knight to the river district artists and the river arts district
4211538 johns mission was to save the river arts district from gentrification that would drive the artists elsewhere he helped many struggling artists by providing studios with reasonable rent our many discussions with john assured us that he would not sell out to developers
4211539 because he was passionate about giving artists and the arts a place to be part of our community and culture the wedge was his absolute dream to the very end he was talking about how that has to continue
4211540 we were all in our own way helping him move on
4211541 and he just flew with it he went very quickly and very peacefully
4211542 weve had that happen they just stop working and die off
4211543 were trying to understand what is going on inside this brain material that could have direct implications for human health
4211544 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
4211545 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
4211546 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
4211547 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
4211548 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
4211549 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
4211550 if this kind of work can make a 1 per cent difference to the life of an alzheimers patient it will be worth it

4211563 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that

4211574 you can go into a store and steal a loaf of bread and do a year in jail
4211575 but you can steal months of rent from a landlord and never do any time in jail its a great crime to commit because there are no penalties
4211576 in fact what we see more of is serial evictors landlords who continually come up with ruses for one eviction after another
4211577 there are lots of tenants who have gotten themselves into a tight spot for one reason or another theyre elderly they have medical conditions lost jobs things that are beyond their control i see it every day and its very very sad

4211580 from the apostle paul to marguerite porete to martin luther the deepest attempts to grapple with the god made known in jesus have drawn charges of antinomianism libertinism and moral nihilism that so few works in the contemporary field of christian ethics draw those charges should give us pause it is as if christian ethics has become all exhortation and no exposition a set of remarks that have broken free from the body of a sermon to stand on their own

4211591 the most overpaid coach is iowas kirk ferentz who made 3 4 million last year despite lackluster results on the field just how lopsided is ferentzs deal during the last three years hes pocketed 10 million including a record 4 7 million in 2006 but has led the hawkeyes to just a 19 18 record
4211592 this proposed ban by brussels will have wide ranging effects triazoles will be banned which is used to control diseases in wheat barley and other cereal crops which could result in losses of 20 30 in yields the eu council of agricultural ministers has already voted by qualified majority with the uk abstaining to adopt the commissions proposals this proposal will go before the european parliament which has predictably proposed more draconian measures which could lead to 90 of common fungicides being removed from the market
4211593 due to scotlands wet conditions fungicides such as triazoles is vital to ensure healthy crops which are key ingredients in scotlands world famous drinks industry countries such as france and spain who voted in favour of the ban have hot and dry climates where triazoles is unnecessary to combat the sort of crop diseases we face here in scotland banning pesticides would mean that that scottish drinks industry would have to import barley and wheat from countries such as france and spain resulting in a negative impact on our farmers and on the reputation of scottish products the bureaucratic elite in brussels will strike another hard blow against scottish business and handed other eu countries a major competitive advantage
4211594 the pesticides safety directorate has stated that such a ban would be disastrous for crop production in the uk this proposal is folly considering the current crisis of rising food prices and food shortages the scottish government and the uk government has to force the commission to think again before it causes immense and irreversible damage to the drinks industry here in scotland

4211602 they kept whispering in my ear to ask why i wasnt smiling i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married i pleaded with them to help me escape but no one saw anything wrong in what was happening i begged my husband not to marry me but he told me i had no choice
4211603 it was disgusting awful i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender inside it killed me inside life became meaningless i had my childhood taken away and missed out on all my teenage years sometimes i still wonder if its worth trying to have a future many days im not at all sure it is
4211604 the objections to religion are of two sorts intellectual and moral the intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow
4211605 who needs satan when you have a god like this
4211606 by simple common sense i dont believe in god in none

4211613 first we played the kind of team were going to have to beat to achieve our goals at the end of the year missouri is a top flight team and i thought it gave us a good depiction at times i thought we absorbed a little bit but then were also dangerous on the attack
4211614 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

4211617 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4211618 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4211619 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4211620 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4211621 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4211622 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4211623 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4211624 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4211625 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4211626 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays

4211896 it is a well known fact that the close door button in most elevators is a totally dysfunctional placebo placed there to just give the individuals the impression that they are somehow participating contributing to the speed of the elevator journey when we push this button the door closes in exactly the same time as when we just pressed the floor button without speeding up the process by pressing also the close door button this extreme and clear case of fake participation is an appropriate metaphor of the participation of individuals in our postmodern political process so we are all the time pressing such buttons and it is the matrixs incessant activity that coordinates between them and the event that follows the door closing while we think the event results from our pushing the button

4211950 victoria is a rare kind of actress shes beautiful yet takes a fearless approach to acting
4211951 kids loved her on zoey 101 because she could boldly take a pie in the face or just as easily tackle a dramatic scene it is this versatility combined with her musical talent and real girl qualities that make her someone we are excited about

4211974 yes they may succeed in publicly stating an individual or groups feelings of displeasure but they change nobodys mind mostly they just alienate polarize and make people angry
4211975 i think anybody who burns an american flag especially an american is doing it for the sole purpose of making people angry
4211976 there is no such thing as the hiv virus if there was dont you think that the multi billion dollar aids industry would have produced a sample of it by now something that actually replicates in human tissue but hey prove me wrong cite the scientific papers showing isola tion and replication of the virus
4211977 its not even probable let alone scientifically proven that hiv causes aids if there is evidence that hiv causes aids there should be scientific documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact at least with a high probability there are no such documents
4211978 the hiv causes aids theory is one hell of a mistake
4211979 years from now people will find our acceptance of the hiv theory of aids as silly as we find those who excommunicated galileo
4211980 where is the research that says hiv is the cause of aids there are 10 000 people in the world now who specialize in hiv none has any interest in the possibility hiv doesnt cause aids because if it doesnt their expertise is useless
4211981 people keep asking me you mean you dont believe that hiv causes aids and i say whether i believe it or not is irrelevant i have no scientific evidence for it i might believe in god and he could have told me in a dream that hiv causes aids but i wouldnt stand up in front of scientists and say i believe hiv causes aids because god told me id say i have papers here in hand and experiments that have been done that can be demonstrated to others its not what somebody believes its experimental proof that counts and those guys dont have that
4211982 if you think a virus is the cause of aids do a control without it to do a control is the first thing you teach undergraduates but it hasnt been done the epidemiology of aids is a pile of anecdotal stories selected to the virus aids hypothesis people dont bother to check the details of popular dogma or consensus views
4211983 aids is not gods wrath or any other absurdity a segment of our society was experimenting with their lifestyle and it didnt work they got sick another segment of our pluralistic society call them doctor scientist refugees from the failed war on cancer or just call them professional jackals discovered that it did work it worked for them they are still making payments on their new bmws out of your pocket
4211984 the hiv hypothesis of aids is the biggest scientific medical blunder of the 20th century the evidence is overwhelming that aids is not contagious sexually transmitted or caused by hiv the physicians who know or suspect the truth are embarrassed or afraid to admit that the hiv tests are absurd and should be outlawed and that the anti hiv drugs are injuring and killing people
4211985 as a scientist who has studied aids for 16 years i have determined that aids has little to do with science and is not even primarily a medical issue aids is a sociological phenomenon held together by fear creating a kind of medical mccarthyism that has transgressed and collapsed all the rules of science and has imposed a brew of belief and pseudoscience on a vulnerable public
4211986 fifty percent of africans have no sewage systems their drinking water mixes with animal and human waste they have constant tb and malaria infections the symptoms of which are diarrhea and weight loss the very same criteria unaids and the world health organization use to diagnose aids in africa these people need clean drinking water and treated mosquito nets mosquitoes carry malaria not condoms and lectures and deadly pharmaceuticals forced on pregnant mothers
4211987 weve put 20 years and 118 billion into hiv weve got no cure no vaccine and no progress instead we have thousands of people made sick and even killed by toxic aids drugs but we cant just treat them for the diseases we know they have because if we do were called aids denialists aids is a multi billion dollar industry there are 100 000 professional aids researchers in this country its as hard to challenge as big tobacco at this point
4211988 those damn hiv tests should be outlawed theyre lethal first of all its a death sentence in south africa people commit suicide theyve been stoned to death theyve had their houses burned down theyve been murdered just for having antibodies to hiv they have been ostracized and in certain rural communities ostracism is equivalent to death so youre scared to death first of all and then you start taking the anti hiv drugs which cause aids and if you take them long enough they will kill you
4211989 in 1990 at the san francisco aids conference hiv co discoverer luc montagnier announced that hiv did not after all kill t cells and could not be the cause of aids within hours of making this announcement he was attacked by the very industry hed helped to create
4211990 people can have a high viral load and be healthy and have a low viral load and be sick and everything in between these guys aids researchers will admit this between themselves they just dont admit it publicly
4211991 the national institutes of health the centers for disease control the medical research council and the world health organization are terrorizing hundreds of millions of people around the world by their reckless and absurd policy of equating sex with death linking sex to death has put these organizations in an impossible situation it would be intolerably embarrassing for them to admit at this late date that they are wrong that aids is not sexually transmitted such an admission could very well destroy these organizations or at the very least put their future credibility in jeopardy self preservation compels these institutions to not only maintain but to actually compound their errors which adds to the fear suffering and misery of the world the antithesis of their reason for being
4211992 when aids patients bodies finally break down from the effects of these anti viral drugs they say now the virus has become resistant and the drugs have lost their effectiveness what really is happening is the toxicity of the drugs builds up to a point where the patient cannot stand it anymore and of course they say it was the virus rather than the entirely inevitable and predictable toxicity of these damned drugs
4211993 many americans use amphetamines diet drugs cocaine and designer party drugs when you do this for years you start getting sick you go to the doctor who says the first thing you need is an hiv test you test positive because hiv tests cross react with antibodies produced by drug use the doctor puts you on azt a dna chain terminator which in high doses will finish you off in six months im not talking about a one time use of a party drug were designed to consume a lot of junk but were not designed to tolerate a gram of cocaine nitrite inhalants or heroin per day and were even less capable of handling azt
4211994 this is my battle with john maddox editor of nature and with people who are actually fabricating the data ascher et al in nature march 11 1993 they claim to have such a aids group that had not used any drugs when i analysed the data it turned out that there was not a single person in their paper that was drug free i submitted a critique to maddox but his response was i could no longer respond i was censored
4211995 look the same virus wouldnt cause kaposis sarcoma in homosexuals pneumonia in transplant recipients and slim disease in africa the hiv theory doesnt make sense but we have a totally totalitarian science environment today you have to become a government contractor to do research and if you dont concur with the government with hiv with gallo you dont get any money the fringes are growing but the majority of researchers are conformists we have a million phds in this country and they cant all be einsteins most of them are just good soldiers theyll do as theyre told
4211996 there was montagnier the jesus of hiv and they threw him out of the temple
4211997 hiv is just a latent and perfectly harmless retrovirus that most but not all aids patients happen to carry to say that hiv is the cause of aids is to cast aside everything we know about retroviruses the hiv theory is inconsistent paradoxical and absurd
4211998 the nih is saying only experts understand aids and who are they theyre the people who have worked on hiv whose careers are completely based on hiv and worse than that almost all of them have huge commercial interests associated with it they have companies they have patents they make megabucks its much more profitable than their university research so those are the judges these people can afford to send you to jupiter but they cannot afford to give 50 000 to peter duesberg or somebody else with an alternative hypothesis like the one to test for drugs as a cause of aids to prove them wrong would mean that they would risk losing their good reputation and their standing in the scientific community as well as their companies
4211999 millions of lives that could have been saved wont be saved if we work on an ungrounded or poorly grounded hypothesis
4212000 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4212001 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4212002 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4212003 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4212004 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4212005 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4212006 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4212007 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
4212008 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
4212009 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
4212010 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
4212011 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
4212012 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution

4212038 primeiramente temos que nos concentrar no atl tico mg o primeiro desafio que teremos pela frente mas claro que temos que fazer proje es mesmo garantindo que o fluminense n o ser rebaixado com 44 pontos um time escapa do risco de rebaixamento e por isso vamos precisar de mais 28 pontos ou seja m dia de um e meio por jogo logo o empate ser quase sempre ruim para n s s vai servir em um jogo muito complicado fora de casa ou num cl ssico muito disputado
4212039 ainda tenho mais uns dias antes da partida e ainda cedo para fazer qualquer tipo de progn stico vou continuar trabalhando com empenho
4212040 the united states is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4212041 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4212042 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against mr musharraf
4212043 with one voice they said this is the time you have to be with the democratic forces
4212044 but no one is actually in the mood to see what it is going to be like to be in the post musharraf era
4212045 for me being an nfl and cfl fan growing up i think its an opportunity for people who appreciate the nfl to take this in and they can still watch their cfl teams
4212046 the cfl is one of the few things we havent lost to americans and we should do everything we can to keep it
4212047 the cfl is so old and theres so much history there
4212048 im trying to get all my supporters together and go down there and protest thursday night to see what we can do have a nice peaceful protest
4212049 we want our league to thrive here in our country and we want the bills to succeed in buffalo
4212050 insofar as this limited series helps the bills stay in buffalo long term its fine but we wouldnt support any expansion of it because no one knows what effect that would have on our league
4212051 im an nfl fan i just dont think we need it
4212052 the nfl in toronto doesnt do the country of canada places like alberta saskatchewan and b c any good i think torontonians are forgetting that if one game or eight games takes one penny away from the cfl what good does that do i just dont think we need it
4212053 the one presence that has been missing in the canadian marketplace has been meaningful regular season nfl games
4212054 we wanted to be able to deliver that to sports fans we think theres a lot of demand for the nfl in this marketplace and were excited to be delivering it
4212055 i think toronto is a fantastic city a major league city where they could certainly handle an nfl team coming from another city which unfortuntately may be buffalo
4212056 down the road we cant really control what happens but if it comes down to who has the money is there enough money in western new york to keep the bills ultimately there is enough money to take them in toronto because southern ontario is booming its solid growth
4212057 i feel like the bills are a regional franchise and theres a big part of southern ontario that has a real stake in them buffalo is one of those towns where they invest their heart and soul in the team and its nice that theyre sharing that with us
4212058 i think people are kidding themselves if they think the argos are anything more than a sideshow in toronto
4212059 i dont see the nfl and cfl being highly competitive with each other other than the argument that people only have so much money to spend on entertainment because the cfl is nothing more than a shadow of the nfl
4212060 it would swamp the argos and their fans would disappear
4212061 a proposta muito grande para o jogador o valdivia achou interessante n o queremos vender o valdivia agora mas a proposta foi muito alta e temos que ter bom senso

4212085 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4212086 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4212087 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4212088 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4212089 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4212090 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4212091 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4212092 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4212098 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
4212099 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details to find fault
4212100 that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4212101 the chinese governments idea of how you impress people is that everything is perfect even if that means a little bit of deception
4212102 and thats exactly the thing that drives the western media crazy because it seems sneaky
4212103 we are very pleased with how the organizers are putting up a great sports event
4212104 the organizers have put together an operationally successful event for the athletes thats what these games are about
4212105 this is not a debate ok you have your turn i have mine
4212106 we are trying hard not to ruin the option of having a membership section in china at some point in the future
4212107 if we did apply it would it would just be a pr stunt our biggest challenge now is keeping focus on whats happening in tibet
4212108 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do as daniel patrick moynihan once famously said one is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years

4212120 theres a lot of hysteria that the turmoil in the credit market will mean students cant get loans
4212121 but students should be thinking really hard about whether they should be taking out private loans in the first place
4212122 students will likely apply for private loans and strike out
4212123 that will force them to get informed about their other options
4212124 students and their parents have so many misconceptions about federal loans
4212125 we explain to parents that private loans are like a well priced credit card
4212126 the federal options are always going to be better parents just need to be aware
4212127 consumidos est o de tristeza os meus olhos a minha alma e o meu ventre
4212128 i cant say if the card was justified or not because i didnt see the play but it is extremely difficult to play a game when you lose a man by the fourth minute
4212129 it changed the game completely the lineup is affected the whole mentality is in the trash maybe the referee made a rash decision but thats behind us and theres nothing we can do
4212130 i didnt expect this kind of reaction from the ref four minutes into a game its unacceptable
4212131 they even hit the bar near the end and they were good despite being reduced to 10 men very early
4212132 we created something really special in a short amount of time and came really close to going to the quarterfinals we tied the netherlands 2 2 and should have won and then we fought hard with a man down almost the whole game we have a lot to be proud of

4212138 but these boys played so hard for me the last five to 10 minutes they won a gold medal in my heart we won a gold medal with our effort and i will cherish the moment forever
4212139 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team im inspired by other great athletes on the tennis team and in every team from swimming track and field everyone thats inspired me got me through this win
4212140 it was what it was it hasnt sunk in yet
4212141 this doesnt by any means mean im better than him because i beat him one out of 10 times or whatever
4212142 but i was finally able to come up big on those important points i think this being considered a bad year for roger is just proof that hes been the best in the world for so long that we expect great things from him every single time he steps on the court
4212143 this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team im inspired by other great athletes on the tennis team and in every team from swimming track and field everyone thats inspired me got me through this win

4212147 ive been unbelievably impressed at how hes handled that for four straight years that every time he goes on the court hes battling history hes not just facing an opponent that has absolutely nothing to lose hes facing pete sampras borg the records of so many before him i honestly dont know how he dealt with it for so long i think almost anyone in the world would crack under that pressure and he never has

4212162 this is the mackinac centers fifth survey in a row that reveals a net up tick in district privatization across the state
4212163 in addition literally dozens of district officials volunteered to center staff that the mere discussion of privatization helped their district obtain financial concessions from otherwise recalcitrant public employee unions so privatization can produce savings even if districts ultimately choose not to contract
4212164 done correctly privatization can save money and improve services from districts as diverse as southfield with 8 800 students to tiny arvon township in the upper peninsula with 14
4212165 by far this is the largest per pupil savings from privatization the mackinac center has ever seen

4212184 america has been working in expanding homeownership however we ran out of people with poor credit we ran out of people who couldnt document their income and we ran out of people who had no down payment people who were locked up in prison werent eligible obviously this seemed to be the only market left
4212185 other subprime lenders helped people who were renting a home somewhere we did more than they did because we helped people who didnt have any home
4212186 at least for a while they got over 400 homeless people off the streets and into respectable housing
4212187 the industry wants to be treated on the basis of a level playing field with other countries around the world
4212188 now every other country of the 12 or so nations that i mentioned spends considerable sums of money working with their industry because those countries understand the importance of the car industry to their particular economies the australian industry is no different
4212189 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield

4212194 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4212195 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4212196 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit
4212197 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4212198 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4212199 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers

4212256 we would be interested to hear your views on how the rejection of the lisbon treaty in the referendum should be handled by the government there is a bit of space now over the summer to discuss this your views will be passed on to our policy group on europe
4212257 what do you think the future of the lisbon treaty should be what were the issues that you believe the irish people had greatest concern about in the recent referendum
4212258 could these issues be addressed in any way to address voters concerns and if so how might they be addressed ie by means of protocol declaration etc
4212259 if i ran for the greens i would be asked to toe the parliamentary line and if issues arise in relation to militarisation and lisbon to stay quiet in the european parliament
4212260 but i would as i have done in the past have to speak out how would party members feel about me making things difficult for members of the government i would feel a hypocrite and realise that i am just the same as all the rest

4212273 you should have never gone with that woman in the first place your loyalty is supposed to be to me
4212274 you promise promotion if jaeymus and distunian help now distunian gone jaeymus be loyal servant to master now

4212276 i must have robbed a mountain climber or weve stumbled across a pouch of convenience

4212278 if i had more strength i would have given it to you
4212279 and now youre going to throw your life away all over again by fighting robyne
4212280 even if i get by her isaac may still destroy me but still this has to be done i would rather she not exist at all then wander through the afterlife condemned from ever entering the heavens i owe her that at least
4212281 i just wish we had more time to sort things out between us
4212282 who knows we may have time yet no ones been able to kill either of us so far
4212283 ravene what did you see when rage was forced to give us those visions
4212284 it didnt really affect me too much that was so long ago somewhere along the way i forgave you
4212285 i had no choice he blamed me for his twisted life and he knew that causing me to kill him would bombard me with unbearable pain but i still remember how he cried out to me right before he passed it was the most horrifying sight ive ever witnessed and i relived it in full brutal detail i couldnt make out faces either but i still knew exactly what i was witnessing
4212286 it doesnt happen often and i cant afford to dwell on it right now we need to get to the valley
4212287 just what exactly is the nature of your relationship with her
4212288 i was in love with ivory before i even met you but she was never able to return that love for a long time it made me wonder about my love for you did i really love you or did i love you because you were willing to love me
4212289 too many things happened at once i always thought that if i ever ended up with anyone else it would be ivory but after a while i started to realize that our time had come and gone i guess thats why i never went back to her after my visit four years ago too much has happened to the both of us
4212290 that thought wasnt without merit she had no reason to trust me but it still hurt youve had no reason to trust me either yet you still have why
4212291 i can see light up ahead we should come out by the mystis falls
4212292 rav before we go out there you should know this
4212293 you werent around when isaiah destroyed the valley and you remember it as a tranquil beautiful place you must brace yourself
4212294 out of all the things to survive i cant believe that house you built me is still here
4212295 theyre formed up defensively their objective is to keep us out of the valley they want us to be the ones to attack first
4212296 im just a little nervous ive participated in many a guerilla strike but this is my first pitched battle
4212297 our goal is not to fight in this battle but to break through to the valley where hopefully sweetseve ravene or sparrow will be able to let us in
4212298 if she believes that this is important nothing will stop her from getting there and rav will follow her to the ends of the earth if she hasnt put a knife through his heart
4212299 and his left is unprotected if we go now that may be the hole we need to slip you through to the valley
4212300 get us as close as possible and i should be able to poof the three of us the rest of the way

4212310 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active reo database a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors

4212322 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4212323 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4212324 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit

4212397 during the second quarter of 2008 cirtran continued to focus primarily on the business unit we started a year ago namely the playboy energy drink tm beverage manufactured and distributed by cirtran beverage corp
4212398 steadily increased growing three fold over beverage sales for the first three months of 2008 to nearly a quarter million dollars from our cold start late last year since we formally launched the playboy energy drink line with promotional tours which have now taken place on both coasts we have experienced substantial traction in the marketplace which has resulted in increased and repeat sales
4212399 we anticipate additional growth in beverage sales throughout the rest of 2008 and into 2009
4212400 repeat orders from distributors and retailers can be achieved at a lower cost of sales than initial orders which should help boost margins and profits

4212406 now that we have those steps behind us all of our energy is focused on advancing the group of 19 wind farm projects we have in various stages with this quarter behind us we have established an extremely solid foundation to accelerate our projects given the increased credibility we are enjoying as a public company supported by a very strong balance sheet
4212407 the results for our second quarter were right in line with our expectations given our business combination and private placement transactions
4212408 with those transactions we incurred one time professional services costs that we do not expect to incur again in the near future what is so important is that in the midst of becoming public and raising our private placement we added three new projects and continued to take steps with those projects already underway

4212432 beam global spirits amp wine is committed to eliminating drunk driving
4212433 we support programs that reduce drunk driving and are committed to working with any state willing to help save lives by establishing dwi courts research shows that those who go through dwi courts are 19 times less likely to be re arrested for a drunk driving charge this is a powerful statistic and we encourage all states to join michigan in the fight to eliminate hardcore drunk driving
4212434 we are pleased that research from michigan illustrates the great success dwi courts have had in punishing and treating hardcore drunk drivers
4212435 michigan dwi courts have proven that blending long term treatment with the accountability immediacy and certainty of court response is more effective than punishment alone we hope to build on that success by raising awareness for dwi courts in michigan and throughout the country
4212436 these courts change the mindset of criminal justice professionals and truly promise better long term outcomes michigan is a powerful example of how successful these courts can be
4212437 we need to do all we can to keep our roads safe
4212438 hardcore drunk drivers are causing the vast majority of alcohol related traffic fatalities and this issue needs to be addressed head on dwi courts like ours make our communities safer by reducing the incidence of drunk driving they work because we address the problem at its roots by requiring treatment and accountability in an intensive long term program
4212439 i am truly impressed with how effective dwi courts have been in reducing drunk driving
4212440 i would like to offer my appreciation to beam global for supporting the national center for dwi courts and for including me in their efforts to help raise awareness for this life saving program i congratulate michigan judges law enforcement and legislators for their efforts throughout the state and encourage other states to follow michigans lead
4212441 pims is offering a unique comprehensive suite of services to respond to data breaches
4212442 such problems will only get worse no matter how careful we are or how sophisticated we make our data protection systems we continue to grow ever more dependent on wireless networks laptops the internet and other web based technologies to conduct our business and transmit highly confidential information
4212443 cyber security breaches are one of the most serious risks in healthcare data management today and this risk will continue to grow as the industry relies increasingly on sophisticated electronic technology
4212444 there were more than 65 reported incidences of compromised healthcare information involving over 4 million records just last year one study has estimated the average cost of a data breach to be nearly 200 per record this is a serious risk

4212446 who will monitor the slaughter there should be a humane group present if this method is used sharpshooters have been known to miss will the killing be done in the streets what about passersby and homeless people
4212447 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4212448 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4212449 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4212450 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4212451 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4212452 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park
4212453 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
4212454 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great

4212478 are you all right for a lift to the match tomorrow
4212479 yes thanks mate george is going to drive so ill go with him
4212480 well i wouldnt want to be driven around by an alcoholic
4212481 alcoholic george ive never seen him drink anything stronger than diet coke
4212482 so because youve never seen him drink youve decided hes an alcoholic
4212483 no dave its not just because of that hes been looking kind of yellow lately and he told me about some test hes got to have done on his liver its obvious isnt it
4212484 he hasnt been well thats all it is hes having a blood test he told me so they can work out whats wrong
4212485 cirrhosis of the liver thats what itll be you mark my words
4212486 evening dave i wasnt expecting to see you this early
4212487 didnt want to drink too much the night before a big match
4212488 very sensible well all want to be clear headed if were to have a hope of beating east grinstead
4212489 yes but hes driving me to the match tomorrow and if hes likely to be drunk then you really should give me a hint
4212490 i really dont know whats wrong with him dave despite what some people seem to think the staff dont gossip about the patients and it isnt the cleaners who make the diagnosis
4212491 no i suppose not but im sure if you thought id be in danger youd find a way to drop a hint
4212492 but i dont have any reason to suppose george is a secret drinker if the doctor is having tests done that must be because they dont know whats wrong with him
4212493 if theyre doing tests he told me it was a blood test and mike it was something to do with his liver
4212494 maybe it was a liver function test they take blood samples for that
4212495 ive just checked the route for tomorrow and found out there are some road works i think we should leave a bit earlier than we planned
4212496 good idea er george i was just wondering if youd got results from that test you were having what was it again
4212497 doctor called it a liver function test but when i went in all they did was take a blood sample i havent got the results yet
4212498 all kinds of things i cant say the names of them but ive got a leaflet if youre interested
4212499 doctor told me the liver function tests measure chemicals in the blood that are made by the liver if the result isnt normal theres a problem with the liver the test helps work out what the problem is
4212500 im not sure i even know what the liver is supposed to do
4212501 ive been reading up on it it stores something called glycogen which is made from sugar and fuels the body the liver also helps process fat and protein from food it makes the stuff thats needed to make blood clot and it removes poisons and toxins from the body and processes medicines
4212502 theres more the liver also makes bile thats that greeny yellow bitter stuff you can bring up sometimes if youre sick bile in the gut helps to digest fats as the liver does all its jobs it makes chemicals that pass into the bloodstream and bile if theres a liver disorder then there will be the wrong amount of one or more of the chemicals the blood test can pick up some of the chemicals if im lucky this liver function test will show the doctor whats wrong with me and then i hope hell put it right
4212503 theres alanine transaminase which is an enzyme that helps to process proteins if the liver is injured or inflamed then therell be more of this hepatitis can cause that and doctor reckons thats what could be wrong with me another thing the test might find is alkaline phoshpatase which is an enzyme that occurs mainly in liver cells next to bile ducts and in bone if theres too much of that i could have a bone or liver disease if theres not enough albumin then that might mean a different liver disorder
4212504 the test measures all the proteins in the blood not just the albumin then theres bilirubin thats the stuff that gives bile its colour ive probably got too much of that because its not just my bile thats a sickly yellow colour
4212505 yes the doctor says ive got jaundice hes just not too sure why
4212506 maybe its complicated heres an example bilirubin is made from haemoglobin which is a chemical in red blood cells that is released when the red blood cells break down liver cells take in this bilirubin and attach sugar to it then its called conjugated bilirubin too much conjugated bilirubin could be caused by all sorts of different conditions could be because of a gallstone thats stuck or caused by a tumour in the pancreas it could also be because of hepatitis liver injury or long term alcohol abuse or it could be because of excessive breakdown of red blood cells that could mean ive got something called haemolytic anaemia
4212507 george youre losing me i cant see how this test is going to help you all itll show is that you could have one of these things wrong with you but theres so many different ones i mean we can all see youre not well
4212508 i said it was complicated to be honest i was confused myself ill tell you what doctor said reckons the jaundice is one symptom that helps him find out whats wrong the test will show which enzyme level is higher and thatll help say which disorder is causing the problem it might also rule out a few things i could have another test later and itll show if im getting better or worse if this test doesnt give the doctor the answer there are others he can do ill need to check the leaflet again
4212509 blood clotting tests can be done with some liver disorders the blood doesnt clot so well how about this one gamma glutamyl transferase this is another enzyme that occurs in the liver a high level is particularly associated with heavy alcohol drinking i should be ok there i reckon
4212510 says here they can also do something called immunology seems thats looking for viruses and antibodies to viruses virus infections can cause hepatitis a or b doctor didnt say which one he thinks ive got there are even antibodies which attack part of your own body and occur in autoimmune disorders theres loads of things the blood test could show im sure the doctor will explain whatever my test results are so i dont really need to know all the different names and stuff until hes got more idea whats wrong
4212511 yeah no point in scaring yourself if theres nothing serious wrong which im sure there isnt
4212512 doctor said that if the blood test doesnt prove whats wrong then theres more tests i can have liver biopsy ultrasound scan other types of scan are all things they can do if they need to
4212513 im glad ive not got jaundice and dont have to go through all this
4212514 getting the blood test done wasnt any bother it sounds much worse than it was they just took some samples at the surgery it didnt hurt and only took a minute its pretty routine apparently and its not just for finding diseases some people have tests done as a precaution after starting medicines to check theyre not causing liver damage as a side effect
4212515 thanks for listening dave talking to you has helped me realise that the doctor is doing his best for me and that well soon know whats wrong i owe you a drink ill buy you one tomorrow

4212690 the day the nominations closed there was a knock on my surgery door someone was there with a nomination form all filled out all i had to do was sign it
4212691 we had a big fight a really big fight over that
4212692 but it was built and its been a blessing ever since
4212693 some people dont stand because they think they cant beat the people in there
4212694 every time someone comes onto council theyll have something they want to do
4212695 when the money comes in you may be able to persuade others to go with your ideas you have to be patient
4212696 the idea of a breakfast club isnt new we started thinking wed offer students a quick brekky on a monday morning you could come if you wanted and half a dozen turned up we used to have bacon and eggs when there were only six or so once a week the breakfast club that we have now was begun in term 2 2006 today there are 140 students one third of the school who have breakfast three mornings a week we have breakfast in the one of the kitchens and obviously we cant cater for 140 in that space the students dont all arrive at the same time that helps and they spill out into the quad we put out facilities for them when its very cold they squeeze into the kitchen so its very nice very cosy it started probably with about 50 students which we thought was huge and that it would eventually settle down to around 20 but it went the other way
4212697 the club is open to all so we have breakfasters from all years and helpers from all years theres definitely a big representation from years 7 to 11 not many year 12 students come but they have their own study its partly a social occasion what a nice way to start the day coming to school and meeting your friends having some food and a chat drinking a hot milo or cold in summer before school starts and knowing you can have breakfast if youve slept in or youre running late for some reason we put out newspapers and magazines too so its relaxed for students transferring from another school its a good way to make friends hunger is part of it many students have to come in by bus some of them taking an hour to get to school and it doesnt matter how much you feed some teenage boys theyll always be hungry also some parents have to leave early for work especially those who work in canberra for example so there are a lot of different reasons for students coming to the breakfast club and many benefits the clubs not just to support the students its to support the entire the yass high school community now in winter we offer five different kinds of cereal fruit muesli bars a snack for recess hot chocolate juice toasted cheese sandwiches a full continental breakfast
4212698 when we first launched the new big version of the club there was fantastic support from the red cross and a lot of community volunteers helped us set it up what was really wonderful was that the kids identified with it so they just took it over we thank all the volunteers who helped us initially but its wonderful to see that the kids own it there are probably over 20 helpers all with different roles at different times setting up begins at 7 oclock in the morning then the serving of food followed by packing up and finally washing up so there are a lot of different groups of kids who help in whatever way they feel comfortable getting here at seven oclock does require quite a commitment but if you come by bus you cant do that you help in another way the kids do it all theres no roster system and nobody is asked or forced to turn up and do anything the kids have just found themselves little groups and they happily get on with it thats the other success story behind the breakfast club nobody had to be asked students have done it off their own bat unbelievable its the product of coming from a country community i think
4212699 we finally realised that we need to fund the club so we developed the walkathon for that purpose
4212700 im concerned about the way things seem to be heading in terms of development and im concerned about the future of the youth centre
4212701 perhaps i have not had as much experience as the other candidates but i think it is important to have diversity in council with a range of ages and backgrounds represented
4212702 the biggest issue of course is water and i look forward to getting an affordable solution for the people of the shire
4212703 we all whinge and complain about council systems so if you think you can make a difference why sit back
4212704 there is no room for politics its for the good of the town
4212705 i thoroughly enjoyed it last time and im looking forward to doing it again
4212706 the essential thing about yass is the need for it to grow in a careful way
4212707 i strongly believe that if you are going to stand up and give your opinion about something that you should be prepared to follow that opinion through my view on life is that if youre going to make a contribution you make an active contribution
4212708 ive long been interested in regional development at a local government level and i thought i might be able to contribute something in that area
4212709 i believe its time for a change a change to a more progressive representative and responsive council while remembering the need to maintain our heritage protect our environment and provide ongoing support for those who are doing it tough in our community
4212710 for the town to grow in a positive way there needs to be a green influence so that its not just about dollars and cents but about people and the environment
4212711 i think the fact that a significant number of present councillors are re contesting is because we have some unfinished business
4212712 it was foreseeable to a reasonable person entity in the respective positions of defendants that said documents and information constituted evidence which was material to potential civil litigation namely asbestos litigation

4212731 the term superior knowledge has superficial appeal when considered in the abstract but its practical application presents considerable difficulties how is a trier of fact to determine whether to impose liability based on the relative knowledge of two parties each of whom is knowledgeable in some form or degree must the general contractors knowledge be superior with regard to industry practices or must it be superior with regard to the actual instrumentality of the injury does a general contractor with 25 years of experience in the construction industry possess greater or lesser knowledge than a subcontractor with 5 years of experience in a particular building trade there is little basis on which a jury could sensibly impose liability using the concurring and dissenting opinions comparative knowledge rule

4212739 our decision in no way precludes employees of independent contractors from seeking recovery from a general contractor or other hiring person for personal injury resulting from a failure to disclose a concealed preexisting danger at the site of the hired work that was known to the hiring person recovery in such a case would be for fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation however and would not involve the comparative knowledge analysis proposed by the concurring and dissenting opinion nor would it depend on the peculiar risk doctrine

4213257 the relation back rule has so far been confined to the statute of limitations
4213258 the nature and purpose of section 581a and the statute of limitations after all are virtually identical
4213259 certain exceptions created to mitigate the harshness of the statute of limitations such as the relation back rule should be applied also to section 581a
4213260 the failure to apply the relation back rule when an amended complaint contains a new cause of action based on different operative facts is likely to lead to an absurd result here the plaintiff could have filed her dalkon shield cause of action as a separate lawsuit instead she chose to take advantage of the liberal rules of joinder of causes of action had she not elected to join all her causes of action in one pleading in the interests of judicial economy she would not have faced dismissal under section 581a any rule that penalizes a plaintiff for the mere form in which the pleadings are cast is inherently unfair and deserves to be discarded

4213281 in interviews with liability insurers that i undertook in north carolina and other states the most consistent theme from them was we do not settle frivolous cases the insurers indicated that there are minor exceptions but their policy on frivolous was based on the belief that if they ever begin to settle cases just to make them go away their credibility will be destroyed and this will encourage more litigation
4213282 without question the threat of a jury trial is what forces parties to settle cases

4213289 nature and purpose of section 581a and the statute of limitations after all are virtually identical
4213290 the purposes served by former section 583 are somewhat analogous to those underlying statutes of limitation both types of statutes promote the trial of cases before evidence is lost destroyed or the memory of witnesses becomes dimmed the statutes also protect defendants from being subjected to the annoyance of an unmeritorious action remaining undecided for an indefinite period of time

4213292 w e readily conclude as did the court below that the survivor cause of action pleaded a different injury than the initial complaint we also conclude that the two claims in the amended pleading were asserted by different plaintiffs the decedents mother acting in two separate capacities with respect to each and that the addition of fresh allegations concerning her representative capacity in pursuit of the new survivor claim was not just the mere technical substitution of the proper party plaintiff on a previously existing claim this survivor claim which plaintiff pursued as the decedents successor in interest pleaded injury to the decedent in contrast the earlier filed wrongful death claim pleaded only injury to plaintiff acting for herself as the decedents heir as a matter of law these distinct claims are technically asserted by different plaintiffs and they seek compensation for different injuries citations accordingly the doctrine of relation back does not apply and the entire survivor claim is barred by the statute of limitations

4213295 an amended pleading that adds a new plaintiff will not relate back to the filing of the original complaint if the new party seeks to enforce an independent right or to impose greater liability against the defendants
4213296 a cause of action for wrongful death is a statutory claim citations that compensates specified heirs of the decedent for losses suffered as a result of a decedents death citation any recovery is in the form of a lump sum verdict determined according to each heirs separate interest in the decedents life citation with each heir required to prove his or her own individual loss in order to share in the verdict citations because a wrongful death action compensates an heir for his or her own independent pecuniary losses it is one for personal injury to the heir citations thus in a wrongful death action the injury is not the general loss of the decedent but the particular loss of the decedent to each individual claimant
4213297 b ecause all wrongful death claimants must show the nature of his or her loss as a result of the decedents death the addition of an omitted heir to a wrongful death action after expiration of the limitations period as to the omitted heir necessarily inserts a new cause of action that seeks to enforce an independent right as such the relation back doctrine will not apply

4213307 they were too boring having three major and difficult courses in one day can make someone very tired how were your classes
4213308 not bad one of my professors assigned me a research and i must prepare it up to two weeks by the way when he told me its subject i slightly became surprised i wanted to tell him that i was not ready to do such a research but i was afraid he thought i couldnt do this task and i was a lazy student
4213309 but i dont think i can present a good and acceptable research about globalizing the economy
4213310 forget about it its better to talk about other things but before we go to another issue i want to tell you a point or maybe a joke once i read in a psychological article that a psychologist re commended his patients to suppose their problems in the form of a creature in order to solve their problems and they laugh at this creature so much that those problems become trivial before their eyes when i thought about the relation of this point with ourselves i came to this conclusion that whenever we fail a course we should laugh at this being or in fact at our problems like those people who laugh at every thing even at the crack of the wall
4213311 okay but its better to keep the recommendation of that psychologist for the end of the term
4213312 look at that tall boy who sat there right now see how long his hands and legs are they reminds me of my of my childhoods modeling paste playing
4213313 david look at that woman who sits down there and is reading newspaper the newspaper which she holds in her hands is two times bigger than her body as if instead of she reads the newspaper the newspaper is reading her
4213314 david i want to surprise you today because todays games are different from past days
4213315 finally i subscribe to a game net server at any time of the day and night i can play the games online and more than one player by paying 45 dollars every month
4213316 you know david surprising you is mainly related to the time when we go out of the server
4213317 you know david what is the main part of your surprising on this paper i wrote the username and password of my account in the game server you can use it too
4213318 im not always playing the game i just play 3 hours a day so what about the other times of a day anyhow i pay for the 14 hours online games so its better to accept it you can use it whenever that you like
4213319 okay i accept it but i think no one can have a friend like you all over the world
4213320 david look at that boy on the other side of the street who is skating how he exerts himself to move
4213321 yes he moves as if he pulls a 2 tons automobile
4213322 if he participates in the contest of the world strongest men he will be the first certainly
4213323 no not at all what is tiredness i never become tired of learning believe me that if the authorities of the university allow me i will stay at the university even at nights
4213324 you mean that you hate being at home so much
4213325 no mom i said this because of my excessive interest of learning
4213326 its better for you not to chant a lot your lunch is on the kitchen table i made a coup of coffee too but dont drink it before your lunch the coffee is in the coffeepot it just may become a little cold
4213327 mom its better not to give me an ethical advice
4213328 i called you but you didnt answer and i be came worried
4213329 i told you that because you didnt answer me i thought something bad may happen to you
4213330 tonight one of your dads friends mr johnson will come to our house with his family
4213331 but dad doesnt still come back from work so how did you know that
4213332 he came just some minutes ago but you didnt hear his voice i thought if you are aware of this matter your studying wont be disrupted
4213333 dont worry mom your son is a full fledged genius my plans never are disrupted
4213334 did kathryn tell you that tonight mr johnson and his family are going to our house
4213335 he is a big shot man he is one of the biggest stock holders of bourse it is about months that he socializes with our insurance company to tell you the truth he has a very good relationship with me during several past months he became much more intimate with me its along time that we intend to establish a family relationship with each other by his suggestion i like you to be present at this party
4213336 i said i like i didnt want to force you
4213337 i also didnt say that you want to force me
4213338 in fact i behaved in this manner for he is an important person i knew him from long time ago that our relationship intensified by chance
4213339 i know dad but the most important people of the world for me are you and mom dad you as a chief of a big insurance company arent unimportant more over the honesty and sincerity that you have can rarely be found in others its natural that the other people want to make their relationships with you more
4213340 any way he is really an important man my son the major share of some big companies owes to him
4213341 now i understand what you mean so tonight we have a very special and important party those people who go around with bodyguards and bullet proof cars
4213342 kathy is saying that she is studying at the same university and field with
4213343 to tell you the truth our university is very big you should forgive me not to know your daughter thousands of students educate at our university that even a large number of them come from other countries for this reason most of us dont know each other but i think i saw your daughter before
4213344 mr douglas i saw you in the macro economics class today you accepted to do a research about globalizing the economy
4213345 yes thats right so you and i are studying at the same field
4213346 but in general i like every style of music which is good and effective
4213347 i myself also like most of music styles but i like techno and pop more than the others
4213348 to tell you the truth i dont like to borrow my required books from the library so i always try to buy my required or favorite books but the thing which caused kathy to be surprised more than any thing else was that used a big plasma monitor instead of a usual monitor and on his computer desk instead of a small monitor a big plasma monitor was showing off
4213349 dont you think that your computer is to some extent unusual
4213350 oh now i get it it is surprising to every one that instead of a small lcd monitor i use a big plasma monitor but this way the images are seemed much more real especially at the time of playing the achieved excitement is several times more than the same playing with small monitors
4213351 you also have an aquarium in your room what a happy morale and good taste you have
4213352 the existence of an aquarium in the room makes someone feel relax moreover i like fish and generally aquarium fish
4213353 at first i didnt want to have such a big room but it became big accidentally
4213354 you mean that you changed your room to a big one
4213355 oh no i didnt mean this at first i chose one of the small rooms of our house as my room but after a couple of days i liked this room because it is big and light in almost all hours of the day the window of this room is toward the south so its light in all hours of the day and as i like natural light so much i chose this room as my room
4213356 i read magazines and newspapers but not the same as you do i dont read the newspapers daily and about the magazine i should say that i just read one kind of it but you buy a lot of newspapers and magazines every day and week dont you
4213357 by the way what are you going to do about the research that you accepted
4213358 its nearly finished just some diagrams are remained that i will draw them at the end of the work
4213359 yes but did you really do your research so rapidly
4213360 well yes i got part of it from internet and found another part of it in a book which is in my book shelf it just needs to be arranged and generalized
4213361 if you mean studying my textbooks 3 to 4 hours a day but about the other books i should say as much as i can and have energy and patience
4213362 im not sure because i really dont like computer games so much
4213363 its very good its really great for the first time
4213364 it is almost the same as yours but i dont have class on friday
4213365 no to tell you the truth today one of my friends asked me to take me home accidentally i tried a lot not to accept it but i couldnt any way i hope you dont become upset
4213366 by the way you did an excellent play you passed one of the most difficult stages for me last night when i entered my account in the game server and start playing that game i became very excited i didnt think that you are such a professional player
4213367 any way you did it very well well thanks for calling me dont you want to say anything else
4213368 no mom to tell you the truth you know that every day i come back home with david but today i couldnt come with david and he became worried about me since he didnt see me
4213369 dear i dont want to interfere in your affairs but can i ask that with whom you came back today
4213370 yes with kathy johnson but she didnt drive the car herself her body guard drove
4213371 she is a kind girl from now you have anther friend like david by the way i want to tell you good news
4213372 yes he himself said that he came back one week ago but he wanted to surprise us so he didnt tell us that he had returned
4213373 yes i called him one hour ago when he heard this news he became so happy
4213374 you had told me that you have a sister who is 2 years older than you but i haven seen her since now
4213375 forget about it i just asked because i didnt know her
4213376 by the way my grandfather wants to come to our house tonight
4213377 a man whom you said is a tourist and traveled to
4213378 yes it is a week that he returned although he is 68 years old he is very energetic he can have a quite and safe life like those who have the same age but always he seeks excitement and danger he also loves traveling
4213379 say what kinds of traveling traveling to because he loves wild life he likes jungle parks and wild animals so much although watching the wild animals from a near distance is very dangerous he enjoys it and has done this task several times
4213380 david is a very good boy im so glad that you have such a friend
4213381 yeah mom i dont know with whom i should walk when i feel moodiness if i did not have such a friend like david

4213408 i dont know where you come from but in our land when someone wants to go to another persons house he will first knock on the door maybe you are a magician that suddenly appeared at the back of me
4213409 see man i dont know who are you but i think that both of us are fallen in a big trouble will you tell me the truth if i ask you a question
4213410 youre right because in the middle ages the continent of

4213412 no im not a magician ill explain everything for you im not a magician but im sure that this necklace which is around my neck is magical and in order to stop these troubles i will took off this necklace and put it in my pocket
4213413 oh my god i can not believe it i was at home and deep in painting by just then i finished that painting roy smith turned up and brought me here
4213414 mr davinci im so sorry it was my fault but i promise that everything will turn as before believe me that i didnt do it on purpose everything was happened by accident
4213415 you can not return me to my land and my house right now
4213416 i know that its difficult for you to believe but truly speaking i still dont know how i should do this i need some time please be more relax i know that accepting these circumstances is difficult for you but now you are in the 21 century and the year 2006 or simply speaking you are not living in the middle ages anymore
4213417 forgive me i didnt remember that you didnt call those years middle ages
4213418 but now what should i do if you are right and everything happened by accident what should we do right now do something mr smith
4213419 there is a solution certainly so dont worry besides its better to call me roy instead of mr smith
4213420 well leonardo we should be together for a couple of days and think well in order to find a good solution first you should change your clothes
4213421 see leonardo there is nothing wrong with your clothes but if you want to remain in this city you should wear clothes like the people of this city other wise the people will laugh at you and ridicule you
4213422 another problem is related to your name you should change your name temporarily if you tell the others that you are leonardo davinci they will certainly think that you are crazy and you may fall in trouble
4213423 okay if you dont believe me and dont want to change your name its better to try it right now and youll see that im not kidding for example tell your name to some of these people around us
4213424 hello mr im leonardo davinci can you tell me that where is here
4213425 oh my god see what did life pressures do on this man take it easy man life is not so difficult that you imagine
4213426 im leonardo davinci can you tell me where is here
4213427 im leonardo davinci what is the name of your land
4213428 i think you are afflicted with schizophrenia a serious type of it i almost know something about the symptoms of this disease you should go to a psychological hospital as soon as possible maybe there is a hope for your recovery
4213429 okay roy i will change my name too but before that can you explain a bit about the sentences that they had told me why did they treat with me like this are my words ridiculous
4213430 no not at all but now you should change your clothes ill explain everything for you later move leonardo do not stop come with me
4213431 first i should find a good name for you let me think john for your first name and walker for your last name great from now you are john walker ill call you john
4213432 hi i want to buy a set of suitable clothes for my friend next to me
4213433 its obvious from your friends appearance that you were making a tv program
4213434 dont worry john ill explain for him we were engaged in making a tv program like the hidden camera programmes but our program is so funny and is different from the other hidden cameras
4213435 on channel 8 after recording some sequences john our first player understood that his real clothes were lost and now he asked us to buy him a set of clothes like those one and if he returns home with different clothes he may have problem with his wife because they were johns wedding clothes
4213436 you are really hand some man now we should just think about your shoes
4213437 can you explain for me that what is tv program or hidden camera
4213438 well you know maybe its difficult to explain it for you but hidden camera is a kind of comic program that a person pull others leg for kidding and laughing in order to see their reflections those scenes are recorded by a camera and are shown on tv and all of the people can watch those scenes and will laugh and amuse hidden camera is in fact a kind of comic program for making people laugh that in our time it has a lot of fans and most of the people like these programmes because of this fact some people thought that we were recording hidden camera program your clothes were a little unusual and funny and all of the people thought that we were pulling their legs do you know what i mean
4213439 todays life is too different from the life of hundreds years ago anyone who wants to live in a country must have nationality and identification card since you arent american and dont have an identification card police will seize you and imprison you for illegal immigration if it reveals that you dont have an identification card
4213440 dont fear man i just told you these to be more careful if you are careful nothing bad will happen i know that its difficult for you to believe but this happened and now you are at our time we need some time to think about these problems and solve it
4213441 we will certainly find a solution dont worry imagine that you are traveling for several days
4213442 try not to ask me a lot on the train because some people may ridicule us again
4213443 when we get home ill answer all of your questions just try not to ask me a lot on the train because your answers are too simple for public that they think you are crazy
4213444 okay but before we get on the train can i ask you another question
4213445 why the wagons of here are so queer why they dont have any horses
4213446 see they arent wagons they are a little similar to wagon but they dont have any horses they are one kind of transporting vehicles but instead of horses they use motors well its a little complex and time consuming to explain it if i want to explain it for you now it will take a long time the train comes lets get on
4213447 can you tell me how did you put that man in this box
4213448 no john this is not a real man this is just his picture and this is only a music player
4213449 maybe you are really a magician dont you want to imprison me like him
4213450 oh no believe me its just a player if i had imprisoned him he would have told you he is not real this is just a film
4213451 are all of these sounds come from this small box
4213452 yeah i put all of these musics in this box and now i can choose each of them that i like and will listen to it
4213453 see john for changing the music you should just press this button this button plays the next music and this one plays the previous music
4213454 can you explain for me that how these men with different instruments are in this small box
4213455 youre making a mistake john there isnt anyone in this box you just hear their voice which is recorded before
4213456 can you tell me why you move under the ground instead of on the ground
4213457 well its too simple be cause of the heavy traffic and also crowded streets moving under the ground is the best and fastest way
4213458 we are near my house do you see that house there is a white car in front of it the one which has blue bars on its walls
4213459 that is our house when we enter the home you dont need to say anything to my parents ill explain everything for them
4213460 this is another kind of transportation vehicle which moves in the sky instead of on the ground or under the ground in fact it flies ill explain everything for you about the aero plane
4213461 you mean that there are a number of people in this vehicle
4213462 yes there are a lot of people in that aero plane there are about 400 people in each of these airplanes that two individuals of them are pilot and a number of them are flight attendant and the others are passenger
4213463 yes but not now by the way its name is aero plane not flying machine
4213464 hi mom hi dad this is john walker one of my intimate friends and of course one of the university researchers who has helped me a lot yet
4213465 mom dad you remember what i told you this behavior is natural for him
4213466 there isnt any one in that box mr walker this is just his image by the way its not a box its a television
4213467 i hope you forgive me that i call you john walker repeatedly
4213468 now we should think well to find a way to return you to your time
4213469 im totally agreed with you but can you explain how you suddenly entered my house
4213470 i had to be present in the exhibition at let me explain it for you from the beginning from yesterday an exhibition of your paintings has been held in our city i should tell you that your paintings are among the most expensive and attractive works of universe one of my friends kathy had bought a ticket for me and we made an appointment at to meet each other in the exhibition and watch the paintings but i got there 20 minutes earlier and i decided to wander around the exhibition when i gazed at one of the paintings suddenly i understood that i was at your house but an important point is that at a time i gazed at your painting i put on a necklace which is my grandpas gift around my neck i think all of these problems are due to that necklace because my grandpa told me that when he wanted to buy this necklace its owner had told him that it was a magical necklace now we should think well and understand how this necklace works but we should be too careful and we shouldnt act hurriedly otherwise we may face other problems
4213471 yes youre right we should think well to find a good solution by the way would you please give me that necklace which is your grandpas gift for a while
4213472 its better to change your clothes john you dont need to wear these clothes at home well i have a lot of clothes you can wear some of my clothes
4213473 this is telephone people communicate with each other by this instrument there is a telephone in every house and each telephone has a number and if someone dials a telephone number of someone else he can talk to that person
4213474 see john this is a television it exists in different size and form its easy to work with this you should just set the channels before then you hold this control in your hands and change the channels and choose your favorite channel by these two buttons you can change the channels and by these buttons beside them you can make the volume high and low this red button turns off the tv now hold this in your hands press the red button it turns off now press that button again it turns on again well now press one of those buttons which i told you change the channels see how easy it is you can simply work with television
4213475 yes thats right i think i learn how to work with television
4213476 oh my god what a trouble almost half of the paintings were stolen
4213477 i get it john those paintings are not stolen theyre disappeared because they belong to the time when you are not at you know what i mean
4213478 see those paintings which are now in the exhibition belong to the time before you come here and those which are disappeared belong to the time after you come to our time and now because you are at our time they are disappeared now you see what i mean
4213479 oh my god all of these disorders and problems are my fault how can i compensate for all of these losses
4213480 the only way to compensate for this loss is to return you to your time now how can i compensate for these losses while i dont know how can i return you to your time
4213481 as i understood from that report those paintings must be too expensive now are they know that you cause them to disappear
4213482 no we are luck or its better to say i am lucky that they dont have any evidences from us
4213483 is it that flying machine which we saw in the sky when we wanted to go home
4213484 this is an aero plane too but its different from the one that we saw there are millions of aero planes in all over the world that they in crease every day
4213485 well its a little difficult to explain but ill try to say it in a way that you can understand each aero plane consists of a one or more engine and a fuselage the body of an aero plane is made of light resistant and hard materials and the most important factor which causes an aero plane to fly is its aerodynamic body
4213486 being aerodynamic means that the surfaces under the body and wings of the aero plane are completely flat and smooth and on the body and wings are a little curved so the air pressure under the aero plane exceeds the air pressure above the aero plane and the aero plane can fly and remain in the sky but the factor which causes an aero plane to move is its engine the engine of an aero plane is usually jet that provides the required force of moving and in fact pushing the aero plane forward
4213487 of course i can but there are some requirements flying has various types and aero planes are also various if you want to get on an air liner it will be a little difficult because you must have an identification card that unfortunately you dont have
4213488 okay well talk about it later by the way how did you find my cell phone number
4213489 was the person whom you were talking with your wife
4213490 it was obvious from your way of speaking and your face that she is very important for you and you love her so much
4213491 my parents dont know that we are engaged dont say anything about this to them i dont want them to know this matter now
4213492 by the way i hope you didnt be offended that i called you with your unreal name because now i m completely aware and believe who you are
4213493 no i didnt kill him it was just a game they are not real john they are just like the humans
4213494 it works like the television you know it s just a game
4213495 well what is this game in which people should be killed
4213496 it is more interesting than it seems it s enjoyable
4213497 you see man its just an unreal war its like that you want to practice shooting
4213498 it was very interesting and amusing by the way you said what the name of this was
4213499 it was very attractive as if i were really in that dray and i drove it
4213500 yes automobile by the way if i ask you to do something for me right now can you do it
4213501 when we were entering your house i saw an automobile in your yard would you please get me in it i mean will you take me to the street by that automobile
4213502 no not now because its 10 o clock at night besides i dont have a driving license
4213503 its a kind of card that having it means a permit for driving if a person drives without having a driving license police will arrest him and also his car
4213504 its not my car it is my fathers automobile besides since my father knows that i dont have a driving license he wont let me drive his car
4213505 okay i dont want you speak in a way that you have to do a hard task remember
4213506 i get it john i get it i will ask my father to lend me his car but you should drive i will tell him that you have a driving license so he will surely agree
4213507 dont worry mom we just want to wander around the city and will come back soon
4213508 yes mom i just want to drive it out and then we will change our sits
4213509 i had told my parents that you lost your memory and you had a brain problem wow man we were lucky that they didnt remember you were sick otherwise dad would never land his car to us now i will take you to a big and quiet street that we can drive so fast and enjoy
4213510 no not now i should first instruct you driving you know if something happens to dad
4213511 you make me so excited boy how did you suddenly remember me
4213512 by the way dennis are you still working in that car racing club
4213513 can you take us there tonight to drive fast with my friend
4213514 yes but you should finish soon you know if my boss understands i may get into trouble
4213515 by the way dennis this is john walker one of the researchers of our university
4213516 you and your friend are very lucky since tonight no practice race will be held on the piste tonight that is wednesday nights are the only times of the week that the club or its better to say car racing piste is empty
4213517 i cant because its one part of our term dont worry nothing will happen to the car
4213518 oh my god the speed is near to 320 kilometers per hour look at the hand of the speedometer dennis drive slowly
4213519 we just drive with this speed up to the end of this street afterwards i will reduce the speed
4213520 well man its better to prepare yourself for a perfect excitement now
4213521 no but i will reduce the speed and you can control the steering wheel
4213522 be careful john as i explained for you if you turn the steering wheel to the right the car will go to the right and if you turn it to the left it will go to the left
4213523 yes but not now because it takes along time and needs so much practice now its better to come back home otherwise my parents will be worried
4213524 this is sara warner we are engaged to marry soon
4213525 not yet but we love each other by the way i forgot to say that she is david
4213526 i do not have any other classes today and sara is free too we want to go to a restaurant with each other
4213527 oh i s not important you will be acquainted with my future wife more
4213528 i forgot to call you and tell you i would come back late
4213529 did you forget can you understand that how worried i was i know that you are not a child but you should under stand your parents remember that your parents always love you and worry about you
4213530 i now and you come home two hours late i dont intend to blame you but please think about your parents a little i was so worried about you
4213531 i don t mind by the way what did you do for flying
4213532 nothing but don s go to my room to tell you
4213533 see john this afternoon we will go to a company which works in the flying by kites they rent and also sell the kites as well as instruct flying by kite
4213534 well maybe we can say that its a type of airplane but the very old one
4213535 no i want to get on an airliner from those i had seen on tv
4213536 its not possible now it needs some time you dont have any identification card and you may get into trouble but don t be upset many of the airplanes are easier to get on now i just can get you on a kite or a paraglide
4213537 by the way i learned how to work with tv but i cant work with computer i mean even i couldnt turn it on
4213538 i will turn it on to play with each other
4213539 this is a helicopter its structure is almost simple do you see that spinning blade on the surface of the
4213540 the body of the helicopter can go straight up into the air with the help of that spinning blade which spins by the power of engine of course there is a smaller spinning blade at the end of helicopters body or its tail which is used for the horizontal turning of the helicopter
4213541 do we need an identification card for getting on a helicopter
4213542 so would you get me on the helicopter its not possible today
4213543 can we get on a helicopter instead of the kite
4213544 well johan getting on a helicopter is not so easy that you think because the helicopter is an expensive vehicle and only specific people can use this vehicle i mean rich and big shot people often get on this vehicle some of the helicopters are also related to governmental or military organizations that common people can not get on them
4213545 john you are going to get on a helicopter just today
4213546 what is it they want me to have an identification card dont they
4213547 well see man if everyday i want to get you on an aircraft after the university no time will remain for me to study and do my daily tasks
4213548 oh no i didnt mean it i mean if you want me to do something for you give me a one or two day chance and dont expect me to do it for you immediately
4213549 yes i know it s again related to the identification card and these things
4213550 its better to go and change your clothes to go out
4213551 please be careful if someone asks you who are you you will say that you are john walker if they also ask you to give them your identification card say that it is at home do you get it
4213552 if i want you to do another work for me will you accept it
4213553 oh my goodness he starts his requests again this time you certainly want to get on a shuttle dont you
4213554 thats your fathers car you also know driving so why we can not go by your fathers car
4213555 the problem is not just about driving the car you know if the police become aware that we drive without having a driving license what will happen next both of us will get in to trouble man although your requests are very important for me forget about this one please
4213556 well how can they understand that you dont have a driving license
4213557 i know how you like getting in a car but please understand me
4213558 i dont want to go by your fathers car at all now do i understand you well
4213559 i find it w e will go by my fathers car
4213560 now ill call david and ask him to drive because he has a driving license
4213561 john he accepted my request now we should just ask permission from dad to drive his car
4213562 dad would you please lend us your car for several hours
4213563 you dont have a driving license we suppose that mr walker has a driving license but dont you say that he loses his memory and has a brain problem so how can he drive
4213564 no dad his amnesia is just related to his family members living place and some of the scientific materials and he doesnt forget many other things such as language social behaviors driving and so on dad he is very important in our university he is one of the most important researches of our university
4213565 so why he didnt know what television is when you took him in our house
4213566 see dad i told you that he just lost a small portion of his memory and you shouldnt doubt about his psychological health trust me dad
4213567 i hope you can understand why im strict about the car and i want you to know that this car is not worthy of you
4213568 john watch it do you remember what i told you at home
4213569 david please be careful a bout the car otherwise i dont know how can i talk to my father
4213570 by the way david please come and take us home at
4213571 john you know you should enjoy flying as much as you can since you can not fly with any kind of flying machine at least up to some weeks later
4213572 no i just pay almost all of my money for this flight and i dont have any money up to one month later
4213573 dont confuse yourself its too simple in fact nowadays people use credit cards instead of money
4213574 how do you put your money in this small and thin card
4213575 by the way why the buildings of your city are so tall and big
4213576 because the population of the cities has increased so fast that they dont have enough capacity to construct more houses so the buildings are made tall and vertical that more people can settle in them
4213577 i understand what you mean but how these tall and big buildings are constructed
4213578 by steel and concrete first a metal skeleton of the building is made by steel pillars and then the building is completed by concrete and brick
4213579 oh my goodness i can not believe that im flying
4213580 its better to believe it because we are in the sky now
4213581 i really thank you i dont know if i didnt be acquainted with you could i ever experience flying
4213582 its not necessary to thank me you came to our time just by accident and its main reason was that necklace which my grand father gave me hey man look at that buildings and cars look at the people everything seems small from here
4213583 yes from here cars people and in general everything seems small
4213584 yes its name is liberty statue but we call it big apple
4213585 this statue was made by fredric aguste bartholdi a french designer and sculptor he was a genius look at the statue see what a master piece he had created this statue is not only big but also very beautiful fredric had made this statue from 1875 to 1884 in by ship in 1885 richard dehunt started making its pedestals in 1877 and finally the statue was placed on the pedestals in 1886 this is the sign of liberty and democracy as well as its beauty i have studied a lot of books about this statue
4213586 its not important how far it is tomorrow ill buy required things of painting for you when i want to come back home
4213587 what do you want to buy that you get off the train
4213588 no but my friend whom you acquainted with yesterday i mean mr walker paints of course he paints for amusement and interest
4213589 by the way today i could turn on the computer
4213590 okay its too easy as you said i move that small sign on the monitor by this tool which you said is a mouse and then i take that sign on this picture and press my hand on the left side of the mouse now we enter the game
4213591 by the way would you please explain a little about this game which i think is football
4213592 yes this game is the most popular game or its better to say the most popular sport among the people of the world
4213593 thats right when i was watching tv a lot of news was said about this sport many of the channels showed football or said some news about it nowadays football is considered as the most important and popular sport football is a communal play in which 22 individuals play in two 45 minutes halves each team consists of eleven players that one of them plays as a goal keeper and the others as defense half back or invader in this play the players are not allowed to use their hands and should move the ball with their feet and put it in the goal of course they can use their heads too three people take charge as a referee of the match that the most important of them is the middle referee the middle referee runs together with the players in order to see all of the scenes and events of the match from near if a player makes an inadmissible foul such as hitting the rival player deliberately the referee will show him a red or yellow card that the red card means that player should leave the play ground besides if a player receives two yellow cards the referee will give him a red card and fire him from the match
4213594 there are some other rules that you will be familiar with them later
4213595 i couldnt play this game in your computer today but now by your explanations i think i can do it
4213596 john these things are a little old but still are safe and sound i bought oil color and some painting papers as well now i think you have whatever required for painting
4213597 the answer of your question or any other question like this is related to the chemistry science
4213598 chemistry is a science in which required things are made by the combination or alteration of different materials and elements these things include everything such as clothes colors washing materials papers and so on but about teaching this science i should say that this is a complex science and most often the chemists and scientists know this science but this doesnt mean that if someone doesnt know the chemistry he couldnt use it nowadays the scientists and chemists prepare the different goods and materials by cooperation of companies and factories and supply them to the market and people can buy them with an economical cost john the method by which these materials are made is more complex then i can explain it for you and even i myself do not know forget about it john i want to ask you something can you teach me drawing
4213599 yes but its not possible in one hour it requires practice and time
4213600 thats great because im not in hurry john today i want to acquaint you with a completely new thing
4213601 a thing which will revolutionize your life and will teach you so many things that you dont know
4213602 no not at all its simple you should just be careful well first hold the mouse with your hand okay now move the pointer on the monitor and place it on the green part which is the corner of the bottom bar now click one time
4213603 by click do you mean pressing the finger on the left side of the mouse
4213604 yes from now on whenever i say click i mean pressing the left side of the mouse and wherever i say right click i mean pressing the right side of the mouse
4213605 in this blue rectangle move the pointer of the mouse see when you move the pointer in different parts of this rectangle its color will change another point is that when you move the mouse on each of the writings in front of which is an arrow another rectangle will be opened in front of it which is called menu
4213606 but the new thing which i want to teach you starts from the writing in front of which is an arrow i mean the connect option
4213607 from the menu in front of the connect option select the first option that is asd this is the name of the company which offers wireless internet now in this new rectangle click on the connect option very well it just takes some seconds in order to connect to the internet now we are connected
4213608 a very important thing took place now move the pointer on the last icon which you see on the left side of the page now click of course in some computers you have to do double click to open the program but i changed my computers settings and you should just click one time on the icons each time you click on that icon this program which is called internet browser will be opened this programmed is so easy to use you can get information whatever that you want i should tell you that i choose my favorite search engine as home page of my internet browser for getting your intended information you should just type its subject in this rectangle and then click on the search option and then another page will be opened that if you click on each of the blue writings you will see your intended information
4213609 do you think that its necessary dont you say that you want to go to a coffee shop with your fianc e
4213610 yes but my parents still do not know that sara and i are engaged and for the current time i dont like to tell them any thing about this matter
4213611 for the time being i dont want them to know
4213612 see john i want to go with you that my parents can not make head of my tasks do you get it
4213613 so if my parents ask you where you are going to you should say that we are going out to continue our research project and also to meet other members of our research team
4213614 its better to go and change your clothes and prepare yourself for going out its near are we going by your fathers car
4213615 no forget about it we lent his car for two successive nights i can not even think about it at least for the time begin
4213616 its not related to his satisfaction i feel shame to lend his car every night moreover do you think about the troubles we may face if we lend dads car none of us have a driving license and you yourself even dont have an identification card so its better to forget lending dads car we will go by taxi
4213617 dont be confused man a taxi is the same as the car but its only difference is that its not a private automobile the taxi driver takes the people of the city in exchange for money
4213618 its too strange do you mean that a driver takes all of the people of the city by one car
4213619 no there are a lot of taxies and drivers in each city hurry up man dont hesitate go and change your clothes
4213620 sara will come soon john sit at one of the tables and wait until our conversation finishes and if we go out of the coffee shop you follow us too and wait until i say goodbye to sara and then we will come back home with each other by the way if the waiter asks you what do you want say coffee glass and if he wants money point to me and say that man will pay it do you get it
4213621 i m so pleased that you accept my invitation to tell you the truth from the time i have seen you my feelings toward life are changed you are the only girl who caused me to look at the life differently
4213622 well before i met you i did not feel love toward any girl but you just you could change me
4213623 i have these feeling too but when i understand that you loved me my love toward you intensified when i saw you for the first time i had good feeling toward you i felt that i love you but i doubt it but when i understood that you love me too my feeling changed to real and now i completely feel that i love you
4213624 that day when i saw you in font of your house i couldnt forget you even for a moment i saw you wherever i went and whatever i did i couldnt sleep at nights i just thought about you
4213625 very well i know that you love me but i like to be acquainted with you and your life more and you yourself know me better
4213626 if you want to know me better its better to ask your brother about me because he is one of my close and intimate friends
4213627 of course i asked david about you but i like to know you better
4213628 love is the most important factor in the marriage but there are other things which affect the stability and quality of life
4213629 if we marry in the future how important is having children for you
4213630 to tell you the truth i love having children but if it isnt possible it wont be important for me and i still make all of my efforts to improve our life
4213631 computer games are one of the most important of my hobbies but i also like listening to the music or watching concerts and video clips of my favorite singers by the way what are your hobbies
4213632 my hobbies are very different from yours the most important one is horseback riding i like horseback riding and generally the horses and most often i go to the horse riding club but i really like to have a stable at home and keep my horse there after horse riding i like tennis by the way tell me about your friends how many friends do you have
4213633 i have a lot of friends but i just have a close relationship with two or there of them generally i spend most of my time at home and i dont spend my time with my friend
4213634 what are you going to do after graduation i mean do you want to work or continue your studying
4213635 well i dont know exactly but i think after receiving my b a i will work
4213636 if you want to work in the future which of them will be more important for you your job or your family
4213637 well your answer is totally obvious my family and personal life are more important than working
4213638 i want to ask you a very important question its answer is very important for me but before asking i should tell you that i just want to know you better by this question and i dont intend to make you worried
4213639 i told you that you can ask whatever you like
4213640 if you miss me for any reason or for example i break off my relations with you will you think about any other girl
4213641 of course not because i just love you if i wanted to marry another girl i would do it before but i only love you
4213642 you seem a little worried you are not so happy to see your fianc e
4213643 im so pleased but her words are a little queer
4213644 i dont think that we have enough time to go to the cinema
4213645 you mean its not possible to go the cinema tonight
4213646 but you told your parents that you wanted to continue a research project with me while this is not true moreover what will happen if you take me to a cinema
4213647 dont say anything you dont want to go to the cinema with me
4213648 there is a cinema over there we will go there right now by the way john which kind of film do you like
4213649 i dont know exactly because its the first time that i want to go to the cinema but i think a comedy one is better when i was watching tv the most attractive programmers for me were comedy ones
4213650 i went to buy some pop corn and chips while you are watching the film eat these things
4213651 when thin and sliced potatoes are fried in the oil a delicious thing will be made which is called chips and if kernels are heated they will puff up and another delicious thing will be made which is called pop corn
4213652 another time you want to ask me something try to ask in a way that the others wont think you are foolish
4213653 so while you are watching the film eat pop corn and chips
4213654 john these two things which are in my hand are coca cola a kind of sweet drink that has bubbles in it and can help the digestion of the food
4213655 i hope you werent offended i thought with myself that its better to tell you before you ask
4213656 by the way pull the metal grip toward you to open it and then start drinking it
4213657 would you please lend me your notes i will return them tomorrow
4213658 if there is anything wrong with you you can count on me
4213659 anyhow i hope so i just asked because i am worried about you
4213660 thanks kathy i am just tired i think this is because of my cold
4213661 today i want to go to the driving office to participate in the driving license test
4213662 really how did you change your mind you said that you didnt like driving
4213663 well sometimes you say something but later you will change your mind
4213664 dont you want to get a driving license due to your new friend whose name is john
4213665 im so happy that you finally decide to get your driving license after several years
4213666 you behave in a way that i think you will never get your driving license
4213667 dont be too happy since i just register in the test and i have not got the driving license yet
4213668 by the way dad dont you remember something by getting a driving license
4213669 oh now i get it so you remember what i promised you several years ago
4213670 well i myself forget it i just remember it by accident
4213671 if you get your driving license be sure that i will do it
4213672 but i was serious whenever you get a driving license i will buy you a car
4213673 i took these clothes from the theatre group of our university i will play a role in the theatre group of the university for this reason i borrowed these clothes from them to practice me role
4213674 very good you are active in art as well as scientific and research affairs
4213675 yes one of my friends suggested me to play this role and i accepted
4213676 its very well art works make your mind be more active give these clothes youre lucky that i didnt throw them out
4213677 hi you are lucky that my mother didnt throw your real clothes out but dont worry i put them under my bed you will need them when you want to come back to your time
4213678 it was strange for me too i was working with that thing which you taught me yesterday the one by which you said we can get information
4213679 yes i was working with the internet that suddenly when i click on a small square painting like that box a colorful paper came out of that box
4213680 now i get what you mean you click on the print icon and that box is called printer give me those papers that i can see them too
4213681 this printer is a very strange machine how it can paint so rapidly
4213682 thats great john you are really talented its just a few days that you are acquainted with the computer but you can search pictures in the internet
4213683 well everything was simple as you said before but i cant still understand how those pictures come out of that box
4213684 dont confuse yourself its just a kind of machine its not important to know how it works sine its a little hard to explain its enough that you can work with it its better to turn off the computer because i want to watch tv with its monitor
4213685 you have taught me so many things about computer but you have not taught me how to turn it off
4213686 okay ill teach you right now see you should click on this corner on the left side on which start is written afterwards a menu will be opened and you should click on this square in the middle of which is a red circle then a rectangle will be opened in the middle of the page and its surrounding environment will change to white and black and now for turning the computer off you should click on the central circle which is also red and then after some seconds the computer will turn off do you get it
4213687 by the way whats wrong with the exhibition and robbed paintings by davinci do they mean me how did we appear in that exhibition on that day
4213688 for your first question i should say yes they mean you your paintings are considered as the most expensive and unique paintings all around the world and you yourself is a famous person in our time and most of the people around the world know you if you think well you see why those people laughed at you on the first day you came to our time do you remember
4213689 yes that day when i came to your time do you want to say that they thought i was crazy
4213690 yes since you belong to several centuries ago they were sure that you were crazy im sorry to say that i didnt want to ridicule you i just want you to understand though you dont live in our time most of the people know you
4213691 but about your second question i should say that wasnt my fault and one of my friends gave me the ticket of your paintings exhibition and we made an appointment to meet each other there but i arrived there a little early i was watching the paintings but when i gazed at one of them that event took place i just carried a necklace which my grandfather gifted me of course my grandfather had told me that it wasnt a usual necklace but i didnt consider them serious i think he himself thinks it is a usual necklace he told me that he had bought that necklace from an african native grandpa said that native man told him it wasnt a usual necklace and it was magical to tell you the truth it was hard for me to believe it is magical and even it was ridiculous for me but after that event i am sure that everything is related to that necklace
4213692 can you explain more precisely how far you were from the painting when you were at the exhibition can you tell me more details about that day
4213693 well i was in the half meter from the painting that is the distance between me and the painting was about one foot and the necklace was also around my neck
4213694 can you tell me how did you hang it around your neck
4213695 i put it in a way that its green side was forward and the blue side was backward davinci took the necklace from
4213696 its too strange the shape of the both side is exactly like an eye a green eye and a blue eye
4213697 yes its strange eye picture look all of them are related to each other
4213698 on that day you wore this necklace was it on your shirt or under it
4213699 can you explain one more time on that moment you entered my room what was exactly happened
4213700 i was looking at one of the paintings of the exhibition just for 2 or perhaps 3 seconds that i felt i werent at the exhibition space and i quickly understood that place wasnt the exhibition since its light was more than your room
4213701 did you gaze only at that painting or you gazed at the other paintings too
4213702 i just gazed at that painting since it was the first one at which i wanted to look
4213703 well so up to now we can conclude that because you put on that necklace and gazed at that painting you came to my time who is the painter of that painting and according to your words we should say that since its green side was forward it caused you to come to my time and its interesting that when i just finished that painting you were behind me
4213704 you mean that the necklace will bring the person who looks at the painting to the time when it was drawn well up to now we get something about the necklace but now we should think about how we came from your room to my time that is the year 2006
4213705 you were standing near me and talking to me and our distance was short at least at the last moment we were in my room our distance was too short
4213706 i exactly remember that a few seconds before we went to your time you brought out the necklace from your shirt and then we were at the exhibition
4213707 yeah now i remember at that moment i brought out the necklace from my shirt and showed you its blue side and after some seconds we werent there and were transferred to the exhibition
4213708 so we can conclude that since you held the blue side of the necklace toward me and in fact you changed the side of the necklace both of us came to your time it means that when you reversed the necklace its function was also reversed
4213709 but there is still a vague thing why did you come together with me to my time
4213710 were there any other people around you when you were at the exhibition
4213711 at that time the exhibition was not crowded and there were just five or six persons there but they were far from me
4213712 but when i came to your time i stood near you and for this reason i came together with you
4213713 so it was because of our short distance that we came with each other to this time but one thing is still strange for me
4213714 why some of the paintings have lost at the exhibition they werent stolen or lost in fact they were not existed anymore
4213715 yes but when you come back to your time they will return to their places again
4213716 if i dont come back to my time or i can not do that what will happen then
4213717 well in this case those paintings will never return and they will vanish forever
4213718 you want to say that those paintings are vanished since they belong to the time after i come to your time
4213719 now we know a lot about the necklace and its function and also the event took place and we can say that we find the solution of our problem
4213720 yes now we know how to solve this problem but first we should test our hypothesis on the necklace to see how we can return you to your time
4213721 john although i almost know how this necklace works its better to act more logically in your opinion what should we do now
4213722 dont you have a painting or picture which is suitable for testing the necklace
4213723 wait a minute to bring my photo albums in order to choose one
4213724 in my opinion its better to choose a picture in which no one exists
4213725 i think those pictures which i got from internet are better
4213726 yes i will try it up to several minutes later
4213727 i dont want you to be in trouble for the sake of me
4213728 all of these troubles are due to my mistake i disrupted your life
4213729 no roy this is not your fault dont blame yourself you didnt put on the necklace on purpose
4213730 but i should do this task even if it is dangerous i will never forgive myself if i can not return you to your own time
4213731 to tell you the truth it is good for me too but i hope you are not offended by me
4213732 so put away the necklace for now dont do it for the sake of me
4213733 john i make my decision and according to our previous experience i dont think its dangerous
4213734 remember that the green side brings you inside the picture and the blue side can return you do you get it
4213735 yes i do you go farther in order not to come with me
4213736 but i dont want to get you in trouble again
4213737 hey john we are in front of the liberty statue and that photographer is the one who took that picture
4213738 well now we should do the second part of our work that is returning to that place that we were
4213739 reverse the necklace i mean put the blue side forward
4213740 yes do your mind at ease in returning me to my time
4213741 yeah for returning you we should just go to the exhibition and stand in front of that painting which i gazed at and everything will be finished
4213742 john go and change your clothes right now we have to go
4213743 no we are unlucky all of the tickets were sold from several days ago now the only way of accessing to the painting is finding its owner
4213744 yes it is at the exhibition but just up to the end of today
4213745 what does it mean do you mean its not at the exhibition tomorrow
4213746 no its not there because today is the last day of the exhibition and this means that we lost the painting which we need for returning you to your time
4213747 its not important its enough that we learn the way of returning
4213748 thats right but our task becomes so hard because its not so easy to achieve that painting even for renting or watching this painting for some minutes we have to pay so much money provided its owner or the museum authorities accept that we even dont know whose painting it is if the painting belongs to a museum of another country or this country it will be easier but if the painting belongs to a person its unlikely that he will permit us to have the accessibility to the painting
4213749 im not worried im just afraid of this matter that we can not have accessibility to that painting anymore i even dont know the name of that painting
4213750 by the way why dont you use that thing by which you said we can get any information i mean internet
4213751 yeah youre right i forget that we can use the internet
4213752 now we have his name address telephone number and email address im just afraid he wont be satisfied that we see the painting from near even if he let us see the painting its unlikely that he will leave us alone with the painting
4213753 we should wait some more days and act more logically
4213754 im creating a three dimensional animation this is a three minute advertisement
4213755 after i make this animation and deliver it to the company with which i have made a contract they will record sound on it and then it will broadcast on television as an advertisement
4213756 if i can deliver it to them on time according to the contract they should give me 10 thousand dollars
4213757 about two weeks during this week i need the computer so much and in this case you can use laptop to play or connect to the internet
4213758 you are such a very strange person one day you seem so tired and upset that you can not do your daily tasks and the other day you are so energetic that it seems you can move a mountain
4213759 i told you that i just caught a cold and for this reason i didnt feel good
4213760 well sometimes i myself feel tired but yesterday you were so upset that i thought maybe your fianc e left you
4213761 do you mean sara my fianc e we have a very good relationship with each other
4213762 by the way you didnt say why you are so energetic today
4213763 anyhow im so happy to see you are glad and energetic
4213764 im fine well im calling you to tell you an important thing
4213765 its very difficult for me to say that but you should know the fact
4213766 how do you decide suddenly not to be engaged with me anymore
4213767 i have thought about this a lot and i dont want to have any relationship with you
4213768 she doesnt want to see me anymore and she told me that i should confront with reality
4213769 but dont you say that you love each other so how did she suddenly make such a decision
4213770 roy grieving is of no use you should behave more logically and talk to her and see why she made such a decision
4213771 but just a few days ago she said that she loved me i love her so much i feel that i can not live without her
4213772 you should see her as soon as possible its still possible to change her mind
4213773 i have a very bad feeling i feel even i can not move
4213774 its okay everything will be all right its because you are shocked you will be better up to some minutes later
4213775 see roy i know well that you love her but it seems that a factor made her leave you and do not have any relationship with you
4213776 you should find that factor that can be everything for example another man or boy saras family her future or anything else i know that its hard for you to accept it but you should find that factor before it becomes late maybe you can solve the problem but if you just love her or she just pretended to love you in the past unfortunately i should say that you have to forget her
4213777 maybe she was just pretending and another thing caused her to continue her relationship with you
4213778 i can not understand i dont know what i should do
4213779 hello sara i know you dont want to talk to me but please dont cut off the phone for some minutes why do change suddenly why dont you tell me the reason
4213780 i know that its hard for you to accept it but i dont want to have any relationship with you maybe you love me but i dont love you so dont call me
4213781 but can you just tell me its reason do you love another man
4213782 i dont want to tell you the reason of my tasks but i should say that i dont intend to marry and i also dont love another boy but this is not related to you
4213783 i dont want to talk to you anymore maybe ill tell you the reason of my decisions in the future but now i can not say anything
4213784 what do you think john if we now call mr james arthur
4213785 it sounds like a good idea but what should we say to him
4213786 dont you say that he is a very important and big shot man
4213787 communicating with such a person is very hard we should talk to him in a way that he wont think we are going to steal the painting
4213788 dont you say that now we have the telephone number email address and home address of the owner of the painting i mean this mr james arthur
4213789 yes i said but these kind people usually receive hundreds of emails and calls in a day that most of them do not reply them of course i think the best way is to send an email since these people answer the calls rarely
4213790 we should find a way to attract his attention to ourselves
4213791 he is an art works collector the first thing which can attract him is a famous or expensive painting
4213792 thats great john youre completely right when we dont have any painting the only thing which can attract him is buying that painting
4213793 yes we can tell him that we want to buy that painting and he will let us see the painting from near
4213794 but we should be very careful we should send him an email and tell him that we want to buy the painting if we are lucky and he wants to sell the painting we can be hopeful that he will let us see the painting
4213795 well we should wait until he himself or his secretary answers our email
4213796 roy i want you to do something for me that i know its very difficult for you but i beg you to help me to do it
4213797 i want to go to italy and see florence in this present century i miss my land and my city
4213798 but how its too far from here and we should go by airplane moreover dont you say that traveling by plane needs an identification card
4213799 yes i said but we dont want to go by plane
4213800 this is a web site by which you can see every part of the world the pictures which this site shows you are taken from the sky see these are the photos which were taken from florence city a few seconds ago now we can search the pictures of various parts of the city and then watch them
4213801 thanks a lot roy this is like that i really travel to italy im so happy to see these pictures
4213802 wait there is another thing now we can see the scenes of florence city by a number of online web cams
4213803 dad would you please lend me your car i want to practice driving
4213804 dont worry dad john will come with me he has a driving license
4213805 john go and change your clothes we want to go out
4213806 yes but dont you say that if we drive without a driving license the police will seize us
4213807 yes he said in the email that he sold the painting several days before the exhibition was held and it was due to submit the painting to the person who had bought it after the exhibition finished
4213808 did he write the name address or email address of the current owner of the painting in his letter
4213809 no he didnt say anything about the name of the purchaser of the painting we should send an email for mr arthur right now and tell him that we want to buy that painting and we need the name and address of the current owner of the painting
4213810 if he doesnt give us the name and address of its owner what should we do then
4213811 i dont know in this case our work has become more difficult let alone he doesnt want to tell us the name of the owner of the painting but i dont think so there is no reason that he will refuse to give us his name it makes no difference that we buy the painting from him or another person
4213812 but if the current owner of the painting had asked him not to tell the others that he sold him the painting he wont tell us his name
4213813 anyhow a few minutes ago i sent him an email to give us his name and address dont worry john
4213814 roy i know that you are upset that sara disrupted her relationship with you but you should know that this matter is just related to you and sara and i dont like it also affects our relationship
4213815 david to tell you the truth i dont like it too this morning when you came later than every day i think you are not on speaking terms with me but when you came i rest assured
4213816 i dont know why sara gave you the elbow but i trust you
4213817 truly i myself dont know why she suddenly did this the last time i saw her we were in a coffee shop and everything was all right believe me that i didnt say anything to her but she called me last night and said that she didnt want to see me anymore
4213818 its strange for me and i tried a lot to understand why she decided to disrupt her relationship with you but she didnt say anything to me and just said that she didnt love you and didnt want to see you during these days saras behavior is so strange there are three days that she didnt go to her work and when i asked her the reason she said that she handed in her resignation i dont know why she did this work she loved her job she didnt say anything about going on a trip to me but today i saw an airplane ticket on her desk the destination of the ticket was seattle she has changed a lot during the past days anyhow you should not be upset because this is her wish
4213819 im not upset and even if i were i respect others opinions and wishes everyone has a right to choose the only thing which i am eager to know is that why she suddenly give me the elbow
4213820 dont be upset i will ask her later i really didnt want sara to disrupt her relationship with you i tried a lot to change her mind but i couldnt its better to forget about it
4213821 didnt i tell you that i dont want to have any contacts with you
4213822 but how is it possible that you change so much during a few days if you really dont love me i wont say anything else and will respect your desire but i just want to know a thing
4213823 its so difficult for me to forget you but if you dont love me i have to forget you
4213824 do you want to know why i give you the elbow
4213825 truly it makes no difference but its interesting for me know how you changed a lot all of a sudden david told me that you didnt go to your work and you resigned
4213826 yes thats right if anyone else were in my shoes he or she would do this
4213827 you can not call it a happening its better to say luck it was begun when one of your classmates told me that she wanted to see me when i went to see her she told me that she was ready to give me two million dollars and instead i gave you the elbow and i accepted
4213828 did you really accept to change me with two million dollars
4213829 but she told me not to tell anyone her name
4213830 okay maybe in this case you may get off my back her name is kathy johnson she gave me two million dollars to disrupt my relationship with you
4213831 well now do you understand why i gave you the elbow i want to cut off the phone leave me alone
4213832 but i love you sara give it back to her and everything will be okay please sara
4213833 its obvious from your appearance that you are too upset and anxious
4213834 oh no mom i will come right now to eat my lunch
4213835 john the fat is in the fire he wont accept to give us the name of paintings owner
4213836 it means that we dont have any way to access the painting its impossible to have access to that painting according to mr arthurs writing but our persistence may become effective and he finally accepts to tell us his features
4213837 yes its better to send him another email and say that we want his features
4213838 what do you think that we tell him we just want to see the painting from near and dont intend to buy it
4213839 dont you think that if we tell mr arthur that we dont want to buy it he will doubt about us
4213840 no even in this case we should propose our request
4213841 so i will send him an email right now and will tell him that we dont want to buy the painting and we just want to see the panting for a short time truly speaking i myself come to this conclusion that we must access to the painting even for a few seconds
4213842 of course roy i have told you several times that i dont want to get you in trouble however you are right and we can solve our problem if we have access to the painting for just some seconds
4213843 when you come back to your time we wont need the painting

4213981 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4213982 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4213983 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4213984 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4213985 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4213986 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4213987 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4213988 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4213989 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4213990 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

4214012 t he basic policy of this state set forth by the legislature in section 1714 of the civil code is that everyone is responsible for an injury caused to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property the proper test to be applied to the liability of the possessor of land in accordance with section 1714 of the civil code is whether in the management of his property he has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others and although the plaintiffs status as a trespasser licensee or invitee may in the light of the facts giving rise to such status have some bearing on the question of liability the status is not determinative
4214013 where the occupier of land is aware of a concealed condition involving in the absence of precautions an unreasonable risk of harm to those coming in contact with it and is aware that a person on the premises is about to come in contact with it the trier of fact can reasonably conclude that a failure to warn or to repair the condition constitutes negligence whether or not a guest has a right to expect that his host will remedy dangerous conditions on his account he should reasonably be entitled to rely upon a warning of the dangerous condition so that he like the host will be in a position to take special precautions when he comes in contact with it

4214054 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4214055 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4214056 all you have to do is start it in pcc

4214067 gods kingdom is like a pine nut that a farmer plants 32 it is quite small as seeds go but in the course of years it grows into a huge pine tree and eagles build nests in it
4214068 gods kingdom is like yeast that a woman works into the dough for dozens of loaves of barley bread and waits while the dough rises
4214069 gods kingdom is like a treasure hidden in a field for years and then accidentally found by a trespasser the finder is ecstatic what a find and proceeds to sell everything he owns to raise money and buy that field
4214070 or gods kingdom is like a jewel merchant on the hunt for excellent pearls
4214071 are you starting to get a handle on all this

4214105 that was pretty much a drubbing really and thats not a true reflection of the two sides i think were a better side than that
4214106 whoever youre playing for its always disappointed to get beaten like that when you know you should have done better because you walk off the field thinking we mucked up today and it should have been a lot tighter than that

4214126 i have to agree somewhat my feeling is that in tough economic times when some papers though mercifully not so much at the post are closing down whole bureaus and covering foreign news less we should send everyone out with laptops to find actual news rather than to hang out at a canned event
4214127 a very unfortunate incident involving one of the clinton press folks told to undermine a story i had written
4214128 and the holy spirit helps us in our distress for we dont even know what we should pray for nor how we should pray but the holy spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words
4214129 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4214130 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4214131 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4214132 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4214133 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4214134 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4214135 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4214136 dit helpt beslist de computer nog meer in het centrum van de communicatie thuis te zetten
4214137 ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik het gevecht tegen dat beeld beter kan winnen als ik het kamerlidmaatschap neerleg dan wanneer ik blijf
4214138 volgens mij moet het debat over de betekenis van de jaren tachtig nog beginnen er is een groot gebrek aan verantwoording over wat er toen is gebeurd ik heb geprobeerd daar een voorzichtige bijdrage aan te leveren

4214147 whats the use of being a nigger if you cant act like one
4214148 it is scandalous that we know so little about a species we are putting under such huge pressure from illegal fishing and oversized fleets
4214149 wwfs new tagging project will shed new light on tuna migratory routes and behavior which will enable far more effective recovery and management plans both for the tuna and the fishery that depends on them
4214150 the plan behind this project is to fill the gap between the little we do know about bluefin behavior in the mediterranean and what we need to know
4214151 when we have better data we would urge fisheries decision makers to use it to make better informed choices for the management of this endangered species

4214155 is there any stomach for john mccain perhaps using taking some political advantage of this or will he simply leave this alone as a third rail
4214156 not at all theyre probably going to leave this alone john mccain had to deal with a story that their campaign was very upset about that the new york times did theyre not going to touch this you know stuff like this usually ends up getting swept under the rug pretty quickly
4214157 can the right wing withstand yet another scandal involving one of its own
4214158 nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely
4214159 well why dont you pick me up on your way down

4214161 ma chi ci crede a ste cose gli stupidi i cosi detti creduloni
4214162 it is impossible for me to continue working under the present conditions
4214163 gerakan is to be a multiracial party but the leaders have been making many racist remarks enough is enough
4214164 but i am keeping my options open to consider joining other political parties or non governmental organisations which can provide me an opportunity to serve the people
4214165 rhina bhar quits gerakan after 30 years another politic frog
4214166 this is what we will focus on and i am confident that datuk rhina bhar and datuk lee kah choons resignations will not affect the partys morale
4214167 in fact in the past two weeks alone we have recruited some 5 000 members this shows that gerakan is very much alive
4214168 koh time to rejuvenate gerakan with young blood time to change
4214169 i will write a letter to umno headquarters to inform that i have quit the party
4214170 perhaps some other members might leave too but this wont entirely affect the party it all depends on whether the rest want to stay on and continue to fight for the party too
4214171 dr mahathirs resignation will have a huge impact on the trust that this group of people including the malays have in umno and its capability to lead the country
4214172 these youngsters might not join other parties but they will stay away until umno can mend the current situation and avoid splits in the party
4214173 he is doing more damage than good whatever it is the party is still looking for a new direction and we need everyone to remain united and not split
4214174 what he is saying is that if you love umno leave umno it does not make sense
4214175 every member has the right to join or leave the party
4214176 we do not hope for any more problems and neither should we create more
4214177 our country needs stability and not uncertainty his decision would paint a bad impression for the rakyat citizenry and foreign investors
4214178 i feel very sad with tuns decision to leave the party it should not have happened in the first place
4214179 at this time when the party is under stress all parties including leaders and former leaders must work together to heal umno so it becomes firm and strong
4214180 how can it be when he mahathir says that he loves umno i met him only few days ago in johor and everything seemed okay what he is doing is not right
4214181 its shocking news to me if true then i would say that it is an interesting yet tragic development for the party
4214182 this will weaken the party at a time when it is facing its enemies
4214183 and it actually started to get interesting this movie actually made me cry and it was like a waterfall crying as well not just a simple tear
4214184 and was acting a bit upset and all i refrained from apologizing because i had told him that he had a choice to stay but he wasnt all that upset once we got home let me tell ya next time i get a bbq invitation from them im declining or seriously going to not come until the end
4214185 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money
4214186 you have to appeal to the cowboy in everyone and sell to them
4214187 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts
4214188 i never wanted to be the richest man in the cemetery
4214189 in an investigation like this you have to focus to make it manageable
4214190 i think its clear that the petition circulators were not adhering very closely to the statutes
4214191 why were the non malays angry with bn its because of the arrogance of umno the dominant party in bn many people also felt uneasy with the racist remarks made by umno leaders these had also caused all bn component parties to suffer in the polls
4214192 je sais que je vais faire un long break et penser autre chose apr s pendant combien de temps je ne sais pas ca peut tre un mois comme six mois comme un an jai vraiment envie de penser autre chose et puis de profiter un petit peu de ma famille et de mes amis
4214193 i am saying he is naive because all the questions he has been asking can be easily obtained because he has access to all the information
4214194 i do not know whether to call him chief minister or just lim guan eng
4214195 the prime minister was fully aware during the soft launch that the local authorities had yet to approve the planning permit
4214196 that was why the prime minister requested the state government to facilitate the process
4214197 instead of answering the state governments questions to him dr teng has launched a personal attack against me

4214199 we want to ensure that each and every person who wants to come and have fun at commonwealth stadium will be able to do so however at the same time we want those individuals to respect the city respect our neighbors and respect our campus because we want the story from game day to be about victories on the field players on the field music city bowl championships and hopefully others
4214200 for those who are coming early to tailgate and to enjoy the game with friends and family please pick up your trash and be respectful of the community
4214201 there was a remarkable change in the neighborhoods from the louisville game to the end of the season
4214202 game day is sort of the apex of an ongoing problem from day to day which is students being unaware of trash pick up and how to handle their trash
4214203 constant ongoing parking problems the neighborhoods are besieged with cars every day not just on game day these are issues that are ongoing and perhaps if this game day thing expresses some awareness my hope is that the awareness carries on every day

4214213 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution
4214214 that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
4214215 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
4214216 when an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution
4214217 had the offence not been admitted officers would have pursued the matter with the cps
4214218 an allegation of domestic violence was made and gmp officers always take these allegations very seriously
4214219 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing
4214220 i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
4214221 all parents can sometimes be pushed to the limit by teenagers who are looking to see how far they can go but smacking wont solve the problem
4214222 it simply tells your child that violence is acceptable and gives the message that its all right for them to hit other people

4214224 not only did the dispute resolution chamber make us a very significant monetary award it also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibility we all have in this area

4214234 we can confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4214235 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4214236 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4214241 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4214242 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4214243 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation

4214245 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4214246 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4214247 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4214248 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4214249 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4214250 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4214251 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4214252 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4214253 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4214254 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4214255 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4214265 can an airplane on a conveyor belt running in opposite motion to the airplanes tires at the same speed keep the plane from taking off
4214266 a plane is standing on runway that can move some sort of band conveyer the plane moves in one direction while the conveyer moves in the opposite direction this conveyer has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyer to be exactly the same but in opposite direction can the plane take off
4214267 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
4214268 if a plane at take off speed would take off
4214269 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
4214270 if a plane at take off speed would take off
4214271 if the mythbusters were to revisit this myth it would only be to clarify the confusion about the conditions set forth by the riddle and would not be to retest the myth
4214272 a lot of teams think they can beat us but you cant go over how fast we are until you get out there on the court with us it was a great game for us
4214273 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4214274 a lot of guys came with the same passion the same hunger from that night and we didnt forget how well they played against us
4214275 we just play basketball we dont try to send messages
4214276 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound
4214277 hes an outstanding young bloke and i sincerely hope he has the chance to coach an afl side
4214278 im sure hell do a terrific job in the next two seasons and then its up to the powers that be
4214279 the opportunity to get your foot in the door is so important now hes willing to back himself that he wont become a two ic thats going to be the biggest factor two years down the track does he become a two ic to someone who might be a better name
4214280 he understands the game and he understands people i believe some really good players struggle to impart their knowledge to people who may not be as skilled i say that because they really dont understand what natural ability is
4214281 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4214282 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4214283 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4214284 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4214285 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4214286 you did not win even in your peak form but it does not necessarily mean that you never will win it 2008 is a good opportunity for you it is a once in a lifetime opportunity and i seized the moment
4214287 i think that if we have a dream we must persist i do not feel that asians are not as good as the europeans
4214288 i think that you must dare to dream because if you dare to dream you can attain it
4214289 i had in mind the fact there was a record and i wanted to better my record but i could not and that is why a little bit i was having mixed feelings but of course the important thing is that i win and i was able to do that and i gave it my best and i felt great about it
4214290 and the way i have been playing i do not see any reason why i can not be there on the podium
4214291 this year especially given the recent flooding weve had we are trying to get the community reconnected with their river our river is our lifeblood

4214307 one of the mysteries of racing is betting with a bookmaker
4214308 with lisa coming on board we are looking forward to her helping our members to understand this aspect of racing
4214309 as a bookmaker i want to see new people get involved in racing at all levels
4214310 a lot of people of my age dont know much about racing so im keen to support anything which fosters an interest in the sport
4214311 i realized that if you compared a child being diagnosed with autism to not making the olympic team all of a sudden that olympic thing doesnt seem so bad

4214333 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country as the dissenting judge noted the majoritys opinion gave federal officials the license to violate constitutional rights with virtual impunity now the court has the opportunity to uphold the law and hold accountable the u s officials who sent maher to be tortured
4214334 i still cant believe were sixth in points right now
4214335 we know we need to be performing better but i also think its a testament to this team that we havent run well and were still in contention for a chase spot
4214336 at the end of the day results speak louder than words
4214337 we need to post good finishes in the next four races to earn a chase spot and then its a whole new game
4214338 ive always enjoyed racing here and i hope its fun again on sunday
4214339 we were decent here in june but we lost track position during one exchange of pit stops and were fighting traffic the rest of the race staying in the lead group is a good way to stay out of traffic
4214340 this dupont team is capable of winning the championship this year thanks to the chase structure
4214341 a lot can happen in 10 races and we need to make sure were running consistently up front
4214342 you should be okay but you need to build up your confidence
4214343 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
4214344 we know what messages will work and what will not
4214345 our integration teams are working hard behind the scenes to put together compelling products and services and were excited about the prospect of launching differentiated plans handsets and services over the next several quarters
4214346 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit

4214354 la cr nica cinematogr fica que se cumple por la v a de cualesquiera de las modalidades del periodismo es a fin de cuentas un resultado m s de la apreciaci n del cine pero de aquella a la que no le basta el mero disfrute sino que se ha impuesto como tarea la valoraci n explicaci n y conclusiones de la obra f lmica confrontada
4214355 sin embargo este personaje el cronista cinematogr fico no se contenta con la mera relaci n de hechos ordenados en el tiempo que perfilan a esta o aquella pel cula en su primera y m s superficial lectura
4214356 es quiz a partir de los 50s y los j venes escritores franceses de los
4214357 la cr nica de cine incluso utiliza desde hace ya a os palabras como
4214358 pero en fin es un hecho que en el presente la cr nica cr tica cinematogr fica es una especialidad del periodismo no siempre lastimosamente ejercida por especialistas lo que con demasiada frecuencia deja a miles de lectores o escuchas expuestos al azar de un
4214359 as para manejar la valoraci n f lmica es por supuesto imprescindible ser un observador cuidadoso y saber escribir pero tambi n y centralmente entender de cine de su teor a y lenguaje de sus dinamismos e historia de sus recursos y sintaxis
4214360 resulta dif cil establecer de manera absoluta cual si se tratasen de infalibles ingredientes y pasos de una receta de cocina cu les son
4214361 a n as me atrevo a algunos rasgos de la cr tica f lmica que yo entiendo
4214362 me parece que la buena y verdadera cr tica no es aquella que vuelca conceptos de bueno o malo como juez de la obra de arte que valora sino la que establece con claridad y fundamento
4214363 la cr tica cinematogr fica no ha de develar el argumento de la pel cula como recurso para resolverla porque no es as como se resuelve una obra que el p blico ya vio o est por ver
4214364 puesto que en lo general el cine carece por su car cter ampliamente popular de las pretensiones dificultosas del gran arte la cr tica cinematogr fica debe mantener un tono acorde de sencillez no culterano con muy poco o nada de r gida y almidonada intelectualidad y eso s pleno de chispa y frescura
4214365 aunque ya est claro que la cr nica cinematogr fica no debe adolecer de juicios de valor quien escribe debe asumir con buena conciencia que esos juicios por muy definitivos que le parezcan se entregan al lector o audiencia cuando mucho como sugerencias sin duda bien intencionadas para que cada cin filo construya su propia pel cula y en ese proceso ratifique o rectifique su percepci n de la misma o incluso desde su propia situaci n ratifique o rectifique por acertados que parezcan los enunciados del cronista
4214366 perm taseme ahora una idea que muchos comparten a n y cuando sea dif cil de comprobar no enfrenta igual la pel cula el cronista de cine que el cin filo com n sin tal responsabilidad
4214367 el espectador llega a la pel cula a divertirse despu s de trabajar el cr tico llega a trabajar tal vez despu s de divertirse
4214368 el cin filo privilegia en la pel cula lo que pasa el cronista privilegia adem s o debiera en teor a
4214369 el cin filo mientras ve se ocupa tan s lo de la obra que tiene enfrente el cr tico en cambio la valora tambi n en funci n de referencias te ricas gen ricas y filmogr ficas previas construy ndole as un marco de juicio mucho m s amplio
4214370 finalmente un poco en broma y un poco en serio tampoco puede objetarse esta otra diferencia entre el cin filo com n y el cronista uno paga por ver el otro cobra por ver no mucho por cierto sin que siquiera sea condici n que quienes le leen o escuchan concuerden con sus opiniones

4214400 scott would do an excellent job with the color piece
4214401 you know id really like to find some chaw chewing old timer whod die rather than miss the os opener
4214402 i got a kid outside the stadium wanting to go the the game but unable because he doesnt have the money for a scalped ticket
4214403 tried but photo said they were too booked with the game
4214404 youve got to have a picture of the kid if hes going to be your lead can we send them out now
4214405 na hes was a little hinky with telling me much the fact is he would only let me go with his nickname
4214406 hes the lead of our opening day piece if we find him id love to get art on the kid
4214407 were going to give good play to a 13 year old known only as e j who declines to give his name cause he skipped school hes got no parents and lives with an aunt im not saying this kid isnt everything you say he is but scott god damn as an editor i need a little more to go on if im going to fly this thing
4214408 scott just finished your story good read im putting it out front i think you really captured the despair of the two worlds in the city in a highly readable narrative i wouldnt change a word

4214413 poor families are trapped forced to send their children to a public school system that fails to educate
4214414 if theres anything polemical about this second season its an argument about what happened in this country when we stopped making shit and building shit what happened to all the people who were doing that
4214415 that exploitation and oppression are products of the capitalist system a system in which a minority ruling class profits from the labor of the majority
4214416 our research efforts have uncovered a number of endocrine effects mediated by bile acids acting on receptors such as fxr and tgr5 this review is one of the first to provide a comprehensive summary of what is now known about bile acid signaling and its relevance for metabolic function from this broad viewpoint we can see the potential for identifying important new therapeutics that can address a number of important disorders
4214417 at intercept we have proprietary insight into the rational design of potent fxr and tgr5 agonists derived from bile acid scaffolds to date we have advanced our lead compound int 747 a first in class fxr agonist into three ongoing phase ii trials the innovative research being reported in the current issue of nature reviews provides additional support for our programs and we look forward to reporting the progress of our discovery and development efforts in the appropriate forums
4214418 une vie ne vaut rien mais rien ne vaut une vie
4214419 there are millions of individuals living in the u s with diabetes that take injections
4214420 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections it is our hope that the results from this survey accomplish both these goals and that patients and providers will begin talking regularly about these important issues if we can improve the quality of life for 33 percent of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
4214421 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
4214422 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
4214423 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
4214424 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something
4214425 we are very pleased with the final results of the double blind clinical trial and are excited to have our first revenue producing molecular diagnostic test ready for commercialization
4214426 the successful development validation and commercialization of this new molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer proves that hdc by combining our patented svm and svm rfe technology and our expert scientific team has the ability to produce new molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests which are the future of personalized medicine our patent protected discovery method allows us to develop molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests that are free of outside intellectual property rights and thereby allows hdc to fully patent protect our molecular diagnostic gene signatures using the same expertise of our scientific team and the hdc patented technology we are currently developing additional new molecular diagnostic tests in a variety of other cancers some of which we hope will be commercially available in q4 of 2008
4214427 we are pleased to have hdcs new gene based prostate cancer test enter the market like similar molecular diagnostic tests based on unique gene expression profiles such as oncotypedx from genomic health inc nasdaqgm ghdx and mammaprint from agendia
4214428 the excellent results seen in phase i phase ii and phase iii double blinded clinical trials validate the scientific accuracy and robustness of the hdc gene based molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer
4214429 physicians that are diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients will be greatly assisted by the additional information that this new prostate cancer test will add to their decision making process
4214430 we are very impressed with the results from these validation studies and i applaud the development teams from both clarient and hdc for their diligent efforts in bringing this new test through the validation phase significantly ahead of schedule the early results from these studies confirm our belief that this powerful genomics based test may provide physicians with useful information to ensure that men with prostate cancer get a more accurate diagnosis sooner and minimize the need for unnecessary biopsies

4214439 amin boleh tak sebatang lidi menyapu habuk di atas permaidani
4214440 ahaa tepat sekali bagaimana jika beberapa batang lidi diikat bersama menjadi sebatang penyapu lidi
4214441 ya kali ini boleh ehh engkau nak buka perniagaan sambilan menjual penyapu ke syukri
4214442 subjek ekonomi yang engkau pelajari sekarang ini pun macam nyawa nyawa ikan takkan nak buat bisnes pulak
4214443 kita umat islam dituntut berusaha untuk agama dan umat akan tetapi jika kita berusaha secara berseorangan hasilnya amat minimum macam sebatang lidi yang digunakan untuk menyapu habuk di atas permaidani entah entah takde hasil langsung
4214444 akan tetapi kalau kita berusaha dalam dalam satu jamaah hasilnya jauh lebih baik satu jamaah umpama beberapa batang lidi yang diikat menjadi sebatang penyapu lidi ia lebih berhasil untuk menyapu habuk di atas permaidani
4214445 di antara sebatang lidi dan sebatang penyapu lidi yang mana satu mudah dipatahkan
4214446 sudah tentu sebatang lidi ahaa engkau nak cuba buat perumpamaan yang kalau kita berseorang kita mudah gagal berbanding kalau kita berjamaah kita sukar gagal atau patah semangat
4214447 bijak sungguh engkau ni min aku belum cakap engkau dah tangkap
4214448 owh jadi engkau dah tahulah tentang jamaah yang aku nak jemput engkau ni kalau gitu tunggu apa lagi
4214449 hmm adalah susah sikit aku nak cakap bukan semua orang boleh terima
4214450 belum cuba belum tahu try me im open im cool man
4214451 bukan apa perumpamaan penyapu lidi itu memang baik tetapi tetapi setakat yang aku amati habuk di atas permaidani tak disapu masing masing jamaah hanya sibuk untuk mengetatkan ikatan penyapu lidi masing masing
4214452 masing masing jamaah banyak memberi tumpuan kepada mengkader ahli yang baru dan memagar ahli yang sedia ada aktiviti demi agama dan umat amat minimum mungkin ada tetapi aku tak nampak pun
4214453 kalau pun penyapu lidi dah berjaya diikat ketat aktiviti seterusnya ialah berlawan pedang antara sesama jamaah penyapu lidi umpama pedang
4214454 ada itu hanya kiasan perhatikan antara berbilang jamaah berlaku fenomena saling mendengki saling memfitnah dan saling bersaing secara negatif aktiviti ini lebih diberi tumpuan berbanding menyapu habuk di atas permaidani
4214455 ahaa itu aku tak setuju jamaah yang aku join semuanya ok semuanya baik semuanya teratur lagi kemas yang engkau cakap itu mesti jamaah jamaah yang lain mereka itu memang berterabur samseng pun ada

4214459 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4214460 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4214461 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4214462 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4214463 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4214464 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4214465 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4214466 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4214467 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4214468 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4214469 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

4214482 i am confident that the concept of india that is functioning in unison in a milieu of a vast diversity will continue to define our identity
4214483 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to the strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4214484 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades
4214485 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4214486 often we are vocal about our rights but we tend to focus less on our numerous duties we have duties towards the country society and family of which we can ignore none we must remember that while discharging our duties we have an obligation to act responsibly

4214529 non ci siamo mai sognati di rappresentare ufficialmente la santa sede che ha un suo organo di stampa che l osservatore romano n la cei che ha l avvenire detto questo non leggo la dichiarazione di padre lombardi come una sconfessione n come una presa di distanza
4214530 le parole di padre federico lombardi sono talmente chiare che non pi necessario aggiungere nulla dice maurizio gasparri capogruppo del pdl al senato continueremo serenamente e con umilt a difendere in politica i valori cattolici che sono alla base della identit della nostra nazione e anche del programma politico del centrodestra una sconfessione di questa portata vale mille volte di pi di una vittoria processuale degli insulti subiti
4214531 gli attacchi del pdl a famiglia cristiana sono uno schiaffo alla libert di stampa allautonomia dellinformazione sottolinea da parte sua il capogruppo dellitalia dei valori alla camera massimo donadi e sono lennesimo tentativo di mettere un bavaglio alle voci di dissenso quel che successo peggio delle epurazioni in rai e delleditto bulgaro

4214535 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
4214536 generally the russian forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border
4214537 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4214538 over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
4214539 so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4214540 what we dont want to do is build some sort of mountain of supplies there with no distribution system
4214541 docs prescence in the community is beneficial to both the military and the local populace
4214542 his cooperation helps us maintain a strong prescence in the area and his ability to reach people in the community allows them opportunities to get jobs working for us
4214543 we will be offering training in fields like carpentry construction plumbing
4214544 this training will give these guys the chance to enhance their skills along with the opportunity to build up their local economy
4214545 when the coalition forces came here iraqis were afraid to meet them and force members seemed cautious about approaching us
4214546 but it made a lot of the locals very comfortable with the military prescence
4214547 ive tried to help all understand the good influence the coalition has brought
4214548 and how their prescence ultimately allows for good business to flow among iraqis
4214549 doc has gained what they call in iraq wastta like a godfather status that he has influence with powerful forces
4214550 when the locals saw how the military came to rescue doc and how he was taken care of that was huge to the community
4214551 we are excited change things up this time and work with josh
4214552 weve never stayed in one place too long and the evolution continues there is an aggressive shift in the material and our approach the bar has been raised
4214553 the level of football that was carried out by all the teams was very honest and fair making the games very evenly matched
4214554 iran openly explicitly and publicly threatens to wipe israel off the map can you say that this is the same level of threat when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons as america france israel russia
4214555 israel wont be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the middle east
4214556 taken out of context there is no change in the israeli policy with regard to nuclear and any other interpretation of the prime ministers words is incorrect
4214557 talk to syria and like many israelis are saying even if you think its a bluff you have nothing to lose
4214558 the question is not what we will give syria after all ehud barak and netanyahu offered him the entire golan heights but what will israel receive from syria will todays circumstances enable us to cut syria off from iran will we be able to end syrian support of hamas we must consider these things with reservations and carefully
4214559 when syria stops supporting terrorism when it stops giving missiles to terror organizations then we will be happy to negotiate with them
4214560 these guys were in the field and were critical to what was going on as the paramilitaries became the only anti guerrilla strategy that was working
4214561 a big question we should be asking now is where were the current heads of the colombian armed forces working in the second half of the 90s when the paramilitaries were rapidly taking over new territories with the help of drug traffickers
4214562 this is probably the most serious crisis that president uribe has faced
4214563 it is crucial to take control take the initiative and clean out the political system
4214564 so far hes been reactive and defensive and ultimately if it continues this way it will undermine his authority which has been his greatest strength
4214565 if you are doing things that are illegal incorrect morally or even inconvenient politically you have to deny all that
4214566 what were seeing now is the extent of the participation of society in a conflict we didnt want to label as a civil war
4214567 it is opening up in front of our eyes from 1997 until 2002 it was truly a situation of serious war it was not a low intensity conflict and we colombians were the first ones trying to deny that it existed
4214568 with that money i am quite sure that hamas is strengthening its own institutes most of the money hamas has already used to buy weapons from egypt
4214569 if the representative of the security forces in egypt does not succeed in gaza egyptian intelligence chief omar suleiman will invite the palestinian parties to cairo again for talks in which there will easily be more pressure on them to solve their problems
4214570 only fatah and hamas were part of the dialogue and the differences were on the seats and who is taking this ministry or that ministry
4214571 yes it wasnt according to the basics of the prisoners document which we all agreed on when they started proportional bilateral talks it failed
4214572 in the past year no reforms have been achieved but a lot of changes for the worse have been happening
4214573 i think that hamas has no problem if early elections take place he said
4214574 hamas already has huge support among the palestinians and has strengthened itself in the past year
4214575 i want to clarify that we consider the issue of the early elections for the presidency and parliament unconstitutional
4214576 not the majority because according to our constitution there is no such thing in the palestinian basic law stating that the president can call parliamentary elections and we believe that this is to pressure the hamas government to accept his conditions
4214577 no not at all because they need two thirds of plc members to vote for his abbas resignation as well as for the resignation of the whole plc so constitutionally it is not possible
4214578 to put more pressure on hamas to accelerate and agree to a program on a national unity government as he did on the issue of the referendum
4214579 i am not quite sure that the time is good for new elections i think abbas should wait for at least another six months
4214580 and i think that abbas should start rehabilitating the fatah movement much better than he has in the past two years
4214581 abu mazen abbas said that if we will go to a new election we will have to go on a full proportional system
4214582 hamas looks to the palestinian authority as an arm that they will use to go to the main palestinian leadership circle which is in these days the plo palestinian liberation organization
4214583 they at least want acceptance of their presence in the leadership with the same percentage as in the palestinian authority plc
4214584 they also want their share of positions in other institutions of the palestinian authority for example in embassies
4214585 they want to have a full agreement with fatah on all the areas of the palestinian authority and the plo and all the offices
4214586 hamas was surrounded and boycotted by the arab regimes and they want also to use their presence on the palestinian authority as a door to open relations with the arab countries they want legitimacy with the arab regimes if not from the europeans
4214587 if they leave the palestinian authority how can they negotiate with the arab regimes representing the palestinian people so they want abu mazen to facilitate this by joining them or accompanying their figures in his visits to the arab countries
4214588 first the expansion of the eu and the closely related need for fundamental institutional reforms as well as the european neighbourhood policy enp instrument second negotiations on the status of kosovo third the political changes of leadership in britain and france and finally the role of europe in global affairs
4214589 already in the late 1990s and increasingly after 9 11 the member states had been over generous in their interpretation of these criteria in favor of political strategic considerations while pragmatism is a necessary virtue the long term consequences of this approach for the continent have yet to be seen
4214590 british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac have been regarded as lame ducks for months and this circumstance will hamstring the entire german presidency no matter who moves into 10 downing street british foreign policy will have to return to blairs first term in office and undertake a rebalancing of the uks foreign policy between the us and europe
4214591 chiracs successor will require months of learning therefore eu foreign policy in most of 2007 will be more concerned with administration than with bold new ideas until a new integrative balance has been established within the eu of 27
4214592 if the eu can extricate itself in the coming year from its puzzling stance between transition and confusion coupled with navel gazing and focus on the implementation of these agreed guidelines then it can live up to its own declared expectations of shaping policy for a better world but the world is not waiting for europe it is up to europe to understand the signs of the times
4214593 on the one hand they and their supporters are determined to expose and put an end to what many see as a culture of corruption that has flourished between government and its contractors especially in the national security field
4214594 but on the other hand gotcha politics may prove unpopular
4214595 especially if it is seen as an effort to re litigate old battles say over pre war iraqi intelligence
4214596 such as warrantless wiretapping and interrogation of so called high value detainees
4214597 republicans believe that a vigorous oversight campaign is inevitable they say it will provide political cover for democrats who cannot agree on a common policy on iraq
4214598 they hope it will backfire and be seen by voters as an effort to hamstring the presidents prosecution of the war
4214599 with president bush obviously weakened by the iraq crisis and cracks appearing in the proliferation regime north korean leader kim jong il may decide to wait for a better deal under the next us administration
4214600 tensions in us china relations are likely to rise as us policymakers take a more assertive stand on the us trade deficit with china the value of the chinese currency and human rights issues
4214601 the chinese leadership is unlikely to be amenable to us pressure as it gears up for the 17th party congress in the fall of 2007 and president and chinese communist party leader hu jintao seeks to consolidate his control
4214602 the countrys economic progress is set to remain largely driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions notably high global commodity prices however the slower pace of economic reforms and appreciating national currency are expected to entail marginal economic slowdown next year
4214603 a un report released last month described how eritrea iran saudi arabia and others are funding and arming the islamic courts eritrea and ethiopia remain in a virtual cold war state following the disputed deal signed in 2000 that ended their 1998 2000 border war and the secular eritrean regimes involvement is an opportunistic venture designed to cause trouble for ethiopia
4214604 the international drive needed to force such an outcome upon an inscrutable and willful regime is not there
4214605 china is proving a reliable ally at the un security council while it buys most of the countrys oil which will offset any punitive sanctions imposed to force khartoum to let un troops into darfur
4214606 the mainly muslim north feels it is its turn to produce the president after obasanjo a christian from the southwest yoruba ethnic group
4214607 the competition for power is desperate in nigeria because of the access it gives to oil wealth
4214608 i see this relationship deepening with chavez announcing more development programs business arrangements and possibly military agreements with iran
4214609 of course what he makes public is a small fraction of this relationship
4214610 i dont see much of a shift no chavez must focus on governing inside venezuela but he will spend considerable time and money bringing bolivia ecuador nicaragua and argentina much closer ecuadors president elect rafael correa has not yet been inaugurated and chavez is already offering refining assistance for example
4214611 obrador will continue with his so called shadow government but over time it will lose traction and not have a serious effect on calderons first term
4214612 in 2007 calderon will work to consolidate his mandate in the eyes of those mexicans who voted for obrador he will also bring new vigor to combating mexican organized crime and corruption within the political system
4214613 b ut the vote was for him not his party logan says
4214614 lula will distance himself from past corruption scandals re organize his party and while maintaining the status quo on the domestic front work towards making brazil the regional leader
4214615 reforms will have to be postponed for some time because of november 2006 general elections it is likely to take at least four months to form coalitions and ruling majorities at all levels of power
4214616 the idea of responsibility for ones actions is often unusual to bosnian politicians and whenever someone tries to hold them accountable many seem to wish to avoid answering
4214617 being a politician in bosnia and herzegovina has proven to be the best business people in politics deliberately seek high ranking positions with the goal of pursuing their own material interests political parties control all the money in the country companies privatization process
4214618 in many cases those who fled justice were even the creators of the judicial system and now when they are being investigated and tried for the crimes they committed they are trying to blame the system for their political exile and attacking their national rights
4214619 the only positive thing in all this is that they did not commit the crimes while serving in the presidency maybe because that position does not carry that much influence but while serving in some lower ranking positions often the ones where money is circulating
4214620 what makes this unique is not that bosnian politicians are suspected of wrongdoing rather what is unique in the balkans is that someone is attempting to hold them accountable in much of the former sfry socialist federal republic of yugoslavia politicians are able to avoid responsibility for criminal deeds and remain in power it is refreshing to see that in this regard bosnia has been different
4214621 market fundamentals clearly indicate that there is more than ample crude supply high stock levels and increasing spare capacity
4214622 as is now common knowledge among industry players gas is gaining significant shares in the global energy mix
4214623 luckily some 50 percent of world gas reserves are also domiciled in opec countries with opec countries controlling nearly 20 percent of traded gas
4214624 this tremendous opportunity presented by gas to establish a leading market position just as it did with oil in the 1960s
4214625 it will be interesting to see how opec goes about exerting influence on the gas market because it will definitely put it on a collision course with russia

4214653 we have been negotiating with surf australia to have these two week long events in the one spot
4214654 we will continue to work with surf australia and surf nsw to secure the event for the long term in this region
4214655 we are hosting a few surf artists and photographers this year but hope to grow that element of the festival significantly in the future
4214656 we have estimated the local economic impact of the country energy australian surf festival to be quite substantial with approximately 2 million to be invested through the local economy during this time
4214657 we are looking at forging a successful relationship with this prestigious event and excited about the long term prospects for the port macquarie region
4214658 country energy aims to add value to the communities in which we live through our support of local events and regional development opportunities
4214659 the refuge works with people who have been sexually assaulted on a daily basis
4214660 we support lots of women who are suffering as a result of being sexually assaulted
4214661 the rate of prosecution is so low that women who are brave enough to report sexual assault are often let down by the judicial system
4214662 the government is working on ways to rectify that but it is long overdue
4214663 myths like a rapist is easy to spot in a crowd and rape is a primarily sexual crime are among the many we want to break
4214664 the port macquarie sexual assault clinic does do a great job
4214665 the counsellors have supported a lot of women and young people through the service

4214667 that means i will have to give a lot of the volunteer work away
4214668 it is very very difficult to live on the pension without additional income and even then for those with a little bit of additional income its simply not enough
4214669 although you hear people say they see pensioners at the clubs playing the poker machines they are a minority many do not smoke drink or gamble and still cannot manage to pay their bills or go away for a holiday
4214670 many do several hours of voluntary work a week where the price of petrol bites hard
4214671 thanks to the amazing support of the local tourism industry and our partners who provided free accommodation tours meals and flights we have been able to secure some high calibre and influential media to the region
4214672 six individual media groups have toured the region since june from state and national outlets all are tailored and themed itineraries lasting three days on average
4214673 we have successfully educated the media that port is all grown up with a range of new and unique stories to tell and they are coming to see for themselves
4214674 media visits are an essential part of our public relations program they are providing a great return on investment because the resulting features save us tens of thousands of dollars in equivalent advertising dollars
4214675 pr is an essential part of the marketing mix for the destination and provides small businesses with promotional opportunities they could never afford on their own
4214676 grabbed the woman and tore at her trousers its claws cut into the back of her legs
4214677 she was eating an apple and she suddenly realised the kangaroo was aggressive
4214678 it made some grunting noises and then it came for her
4214679 the kangaroo grabbed her tore the back of her strides and scratched her skin rather badly as well
4214680 the important thing is not to go too close to them
4214681 but kangaroos are wild animals and they can be very dangerous
4214682 they think everyone else is a kangaroo and if you dont behave with proper kangaroo etiquette you risk being attacked if you act in a way they perceive as being aggressive in particular
4214683 a lot of teams think they can beat us but you cant go over how fast we are until you get out there on the court with us it was a great game for us
4214684 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4214685 a lot of guys came with the same passion the same hunger from that night and we didnt forget how well they played against us
4214686 we just play basketball we dont try to send messages
4214687 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound
4214688 i want to ensure we get the funding for a new fourth wing at port macquarie base hospital the oxley hwy deviation actually gets built at least 20 extra police are allocated to the local area command and i want to ensure our schools are given more resources to provide the best learning environment for our kids
4214689 the greatest demand has come from older people and children
4214690 the nature of injuries and illnesses has also varied widely from fractures and sprains through to pneumonia and chest pains and ailments consistent with the colder weather
4214691 the hospital aims at having ambulance patients off stretcher and into the emergency department for assessment and treatment within the benchmark time of 30 minutes
4214692 although this is not always possible ambulance patients are in a clinically managed environment that ensures their safety priority access to the emergency department is provided for the most critically ill patients
4214693 some 20 per cent of all emergency department patients are managed by this unit
4214694 patients in the medical assessment unit receive more intense treatment allowing earlier recovery and discharge sometimes into the hospital in the home program
4214695 but i think that having nancy pelosi speak is a mistake she is the symbol of the ineffective democrat led congress she is a reminder that democrats would prefer to allow millions of americans to have to choose between food and or work or paying their energy bills she is the voice of the democratic party that refused to even consider having a vote on domestic drilling effectively saying that democrats have no intention of being bi partisan if senator obama is elected
4214696 speaker pelosi has walled off any discussion of domestic drilling for oil she has refused to allow any votes on the subject and according to her most recent comments on larry king she will only consider possibly allowing a vote on domestic drilling if it also includes alternative energy incentives effectively that means that speaker pelosi wants alternative energy to get more money to earn more money for herself the higher the cost for oil the better her alternative energy stocks will do and the american public be damned
4214697 and the only real outcome of these actions by the clintons is weakening of senator obama possibly splitting the democratic party and causing obama to lose that would open the door to senator clinton claiming she could have won and paving the way for her run in 2012 that is unless she cant get the nomination at the dnc its so deceptive it can only be a clinton plan
4214698 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4214699 its only taken her a day to realize that 2143 is over 2118 and that she has lost only a day to recognize that using race and religion as negative attacks has not helped her that every woman in america will not flock to her just because of her gender that taking every position possible on issues like illegal immigrants getting drivers liscences or lying to the public with ireland and bosnia to name a few is not a means to gain votes
4214700 obama will make it a top priority of his administration to protect social security benefits for current and future beneficiaries alike
4214701 and he does not believe it is necessary or fair to hard working seniors to raise the retirement age
4214702 the first place to look for ways to strengthen social security is the payroll tax system
4214703 is i have said that the sanction regime is like swiss cheese that meant that they werent very effective

4214709 the world bank has formed a group that is working to reduce natural gas venting or flaring based in part on its recent report estimating global vented or flared natural gas reaches about 14 billion cubic feet per day bcf d the burning of the natural gas reportedly produces 400 million tons a year of carbon dioxide which ghg greenhouse gases scientists blame for contributing to climate change
4214710 one of the means by which natural gas is captured and moved to markets such as the
4214711 often there is no perceived market for this gas and no known way of financing the transport of it to market if identified
4214712 emission markets encourage capital to reduce ghgs and provide economic benefit to developing countries to be invested in these projects as they find substantial return on their investments

4214755 die kommenden tage und monate entscheiden ber die zukunft der us russischen beziehungen meine pers nliche meinung ist dass russlands vorgehen gegen einen souver nen staat folgen haben muss

4214775 for all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law 13 for it is not the hearers of the law who are just before god but the doers of the law will be justified 14 for when gentiles who do not have the law do instinctively the things of the law these not having the law are a law to themselves 15 in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them

4214789 in general the company releases a new service or version once every several months
4214790 this is when we can do a marketing and pr push between those releases the blog is an effective tool to keep in touch with the market for instance during the first week of august three articles from the quintura blog were featured on the techmeme homepage as a result weve welcomed new blog readers as well as new web publishers who were interested in our product the quintura site search
4214791 select a segment and make sure it could be of interest for the industry and not only for company observers the stories must be relevant for a wide business audience

4214800 if immodesty is the incarnation of a pagan worldview then why are we seeing so much immodesty among christians the answer is that we are experiencing the cultural captivity of the church
4214801 what we are witnessing is a sweeping secularization of the church in her very mind and morals
4214802 modesty matters because it is an expression of our worldview and a measure of our sanctification
4214803 in light of the value god places on marriage and fidelity immodesty is no small sin it is not simply a silly and vain form of self display it is a snare to serious sin
4214804 when it comes to finding a man no attention is better than the wrong attention a modest woman on the other hand is not only communicating her respect for the institution of marriage she is also telling all would be suitors that she is not cheap
4214805 in teaching holiness we will be restoring modesty for holiness is its soil
4214806 an immodest worshiper is an oxymoron a contradiction in terms it is a frightening thought but if a woman comes to church dressed to get attention then she is competing with christ
4214807 over the river and through the woods to grandmothers house
4214808 hilary duff was spotted in beverly hills california involved with two well dressed gentlemen in a business conversation

4214810 colin is charming and wonderful i had the best time with him and i would love to work with him again hes completely smooth and he has a dry humor which is fabulous
4214811 i cant discuss my personal life too much or it would become rather impersonal
4214812 no i really love what she became in high school musical 2
4214813 in the second movie you see her making hard decisions and becoming a strong woman thats one thing im very proud of you really see her grow as a person
4214814 for weeks now people have been asking me where are the pasties
4214815 the average fan appears to be willing to pay 10 for a digital copy now that may not sound like a blow out its the going price for most records on apples itunes and that price in turn looks to be about right for a digitally downloaded album
4214816 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4214817 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

4214819 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine
4214820 in key battleground states the retiree vote is going to be crucial in the presidential race
4214821 our research polling focus groups indicates that many seniors still are unaware of john mccains record in support of privatization and plans to drastically reduce benefits
4214822 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4214823 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4214824 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4214825 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4214826 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4214827 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4214828 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4214829 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4214830 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
4214831 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
4214832 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4214833 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
4214834 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
4214835 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
4214836 there is a perception out there that we are old media that we are stuck in the old days but since we formed the digital media division in jan 3 we have probably done over 20 new media deals we did a comcast deal weve done a google deal weve done numerous deals with verizon were doing video on demand on our own website we did the ncaa basketball tournament
4214837 so far we have several teams moving across the entire country verifying the possibility of other assets and if so well request a a warrant from a judge next week for future confiscations

4214839 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
4214840 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
4214841 sean lane bought a 14k white gold 1 5 ct diamond eternity flower ring from overstock com
4214842 the heart of the conduct complained of involved the communication transmission and interception of personally identifying information and personal private data of the class members

4214854 das zusammenleben der menschen aus unterschiedlichen kulturen ist mit konflikten verbunden
4214855 i know it is good to honor my emotions and release them without holding them in however i also know the value of being in positive emotion so we can attract positive experience when i feel sad or angry or any number of negative emotions and i am tempted to try to change the thought in order to stay in the positive doesnt always work i was just wondering what your thoughts are on this
4214856 simply notice the natural order of things work with it rather than against it for to try to change what is only sets up resistance

4214916 demon3 the argument being that you need one to protect yourself but the reality being that free availability of guns is what makes the usa a dangerous place to be in the first place
4214917 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government

4214927 offensive lineman andrew miller has been playing really well the younger guys are learning and well see how well they do in the scrimmage saturday a lot is thrown at us on saturday and its interesting to see how guys deal with it

4214940 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4214941 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4214942 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4214943 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4214944 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4214945 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4214946 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4214947 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4214948 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4214949 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4214981 lets just put the program on the ground and see if it works
4214982 why did intelligence civil affairs psyop and special forces allow their turf to be trampled on by tradoc dcsint why allow so much money to be wasted when those elements could have used it better
4214983 since shes been with the hts program she has been a dedicated and committed professional
4214984 as pointed out from the start the weak points were and remain training and recruitment for anthropologists and military team members there is a heavy price tag of 110 000 and upwards of 200 000 for htt leaders per deployment but lots of academias best will not be swayed by dollars where are the assets for recruitment
4214985 as usual the fobbits forward operating base personnel who never leave the base and remfs rear echelon mother f are in charge and the guys on the line are ignored who needs a combat veteran when youve got google looks like we got out at the right time
4214986 i think we do need an hts program albeit better managed
4214987 all in all it was quite enjoyable for me to observe iraqis and soldiers enjoying each others company unfortunately the hts program managers never asked me to brief them on any successes i had while deployed it may not have been on the grand scale of building a soccer field in a remote village but it was an important step to building trusting relationships
4214988 are studying politics which has some cultural elements but not culture in the restricted sense most of the htt reports are boilerplate personnel recruiting vetting etc
4214989 there is something wrong here this was a super concept but the hts program management did not have the people to execute or support the hts concept no one is in charge at the higher levels and there is no way to get rid of anyone they were told early on that someone would die because they anthropologists social scientists are not qualified for military operations and do not understand where they fit in with the military or recognize just how dangerous the environment they are in is they are allowed to go their own way
4214990 why wasnt she calling the lead anthropologist dr mcfate or a field advisor who is managing or advising the htts once they are deployed into combat
4214991 they htts become the responsibility of the military unit to which they are assigned
4214992 you cant attack all the people in the program some making a living some trying hard but to say that attacking the armys tradoc hts program is un american is wrong its leadership that has caused all these problems if anything questioning a program gone wrong is pro american and pro army many want to see things done right its a leadership problem much attention has been paid in the media to questioning team members qualifications yet no one has questioned the qualifications of the program leaders

4215002 wal mart may be the worlds largest retailer and americas number one private employer but it is not above the law
4215003 wal mart has intimidated its workers and attempted to scare them into voting against a particular party and candidate and from what workers tell us these meetings havent stopped this behavior proves that wal mart is willing to go to any lengths to put profits ahead of its workers
4215004 these are serious actions taken by wal mart which are in violation of federal election law and we request that you investigate them to the fullest extent possible wrote david nassar executive director of wal mart watch in the letter

4215035 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against sen barack obamas election to employees who were not in its restricted class we request that the commission immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and if so to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal law
4215036 wal mart has bullied its workers and managers for years

4215052 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4215053 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4215054 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4215055 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4215056 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4215057 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market

4215077 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4215078 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4215079 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4215080 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4215081 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4215082 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4215083 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4215084 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4215085 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4215086 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4215087 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day

4215105 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4215106 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4215107 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4215108 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4215109 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4215110 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4215111 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4215112 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4215113 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4215114 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4215124 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4215125 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4215126 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4215159 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4215160 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4215161 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4215162 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4215163 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4215164 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4215165 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4215166 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4215167 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4215168 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4215169 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4215170 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4215171 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new

4215192 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly

4215195 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4215196 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4215197 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4215198 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases

4215205 ainda que a densidade de celulares no brasil j se mostre bastante relevante o cen rio para este mercado nos pr ximos anos dever seguir favor vel
4215206 devido aos fortes resultados apresentados pelas novas habilita es no primeiro semestre
4215207 ainda que a atual densidade j possa ser considerada alta n o consideramos estas estimativas t o agressivas uma vez que a densidade esperada para o pr ximo ano n o apenas seria menor que a apresentada por muitas na es que possuem hoje um pib produto interno bruto per capita semelhante ao projetado para a economia dom stica em 2009 mas tamb m porque a densidade do servi o n o d mostras de satura o mesmo nos pa ses mais ricos
4215208 foi poss vel constatar desta maneira que o servi o m vel j se encontra bastante difundido na maioria das na es do globo sendo que em v rias delas por volta de 30 as densidades foram at mesmo superiores a cem terminais por cem habitantes
4215209 as informa es da itu mostram que a penetra o da telefonia m vel est fortemente correlacionada com o pib per capita de cada na o o que bastante intuitivo em outras palavras quanto maior o pib per capita maior a densidade do servi o

4215215 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4215216 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4215217 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4215218 neither a flight risk nor a danger to any person or the community
4215219 we have some radio and tv ads that have just come up
4215220 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4215221 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4215222 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4215223 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4215224 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4215225 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4215226 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4215227 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4215228 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4215229 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4215230 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4215231 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4215232 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4215233 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4215234 to honor this commitment and take immediate measures to allow and facilitate the work of humanitarian actors
4215235 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4215236 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4215237 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4215238 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4215248 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4215250 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4215251 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4215252 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4215253 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4215254 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4215262 this agreement allows us to reach many more big ten fans with our programming because of the high concentration of comcast subscribers in big ten states
4215263 with the comcast deal now in place the big ten network will be available to more than two thirds of all homes in the big ten country
4215264 this is an amazing opportunity for our students not only to gain real life engineering experience but to do so while visiting and experiencing a completely different culture and way of life
4215265 so not only will they have this tremendous real world experience but they will have to take what they have learned about civil engineering and apply it to an environment where all the state of the art tools and technology are not available for the project
4215266 so a big part of this project will be taking what they know and adapting it to help people who truly are in need of this kind of aid

4215295 el t rmino cirrosis procede del griego y significa duro la aplicaci n de dicho nombre a esta enfermedad se debe a que los m dicos antiguos se percataron del aumento de la consistencia del h gado posteriormente se fue conociendo que la dureza del rgano se produce debido a una alteraci n que es fundamental para que se desarrolle la cirrosis la fibrosis hep tica responsable de todas las alteraciones ligadas a esta enfermedad

4215322 ahora hay que trabajar de verdad porque una buena pretemporada no te marca un buen a o
4215323 siempre es mejor comenzar con ilusi n ver que los resultados te acompa an y crecer en autoconfianza que el equipo sea consciente de sus virtudes adquiera su propia personalidad y la aplique
4215324 con una gran proyecci n que han llegado con una gran ilusi n
4215325 es diferente iniciar el trabajo desde el mes de julio que llegar al equipo en octubre pero nuestra ilusi n es todav a m s grande y estamos encantados de c mo afronta la plantilla la temporada
4215326 siempre te gusta comenzar en casa y agradar a los aficionados desde el principio pero la liga es larga y hay que jugar contra todos por eso no me gusta lamentarme por c mo va el calendario
4215327 cios should present utility costs as if they were an outsourcer on a per department basis whether its for email usage help desk calls or the network

4215329 fundamentally if you dont define what it is that you are supposed to be doing its very difficult to have a view of how it is improving
4215330 which is why we encourage it service catalog definition as the very first step of any itil implementation its an absolutely critical first step and its fundamental to any it performance improvement initiative

4215345 is focused on the realization that it management is accountable for knowing how any given component or device supports a service which impacts or enables a business process and outcome
4215346 one of the gaps that evolved was that the focus on service management became very operationally based
4215347 the big change that were introducing is to take a broader viewpoint of what service management encompasses including strategic considerations the design implications the cultural and organizational change implications so the major shift is to introduce service management from a life cycle perspective as opposed to just a process based view
4215348 if you could spray pixie dust and make your business it alignment challenges go away would you do it

4215353 how many layers should a hierarchical service catalog have who owns each layer what is the relationship between the service catalog and the cmdb
4215354 here is a general hierarchical service model like the one below here are some examples for how we have applied this model to help it shops like yours to put together their service catalogs lets spend some time together and figure out which one fits you best and use it as a starting point
4215355 ive cut as much as i can cut and now i am asked to cut some more now what
4215356 service catalogs thats noting new weve had a service catalog for the last ten years
4215357 the vendors and it operations alike have recognized that continual state of change and agility are a way of life in todays it world and that the service catalog provides the basis from which these changes can be managed
4215358 the is organization could achieve as much as 48 reduction in its annual total cost of ownership by adopting it service management principles
4215359 it service management is a foundation capability for climbing the is credibility curve and is therefore critical to long term survival
4215360 companies that have implemented service delivery management tools have saved 30 to 40 of the cost of these services reduced the time to deliver services by 50 and improved quality between 25 and 40
4215361 service catalogs are the heart of it service delivery in fact they are or should be the heart of any service delivery organization within the enterprise

4215365 80 of what a typical it operations shop does is managing changes to running services rather than implementing new ones

4215386 when i was 16 i decided i wanted to live in the 19th century
4215387 for 10 years i was looking over my shoulder fearing the worst vengeance and that daily concern became emotionally draining for me
4215388 i lived in fear that the next round in my case would force the closure of my stores and the sudden loss of income
4215389 for the same reason i was compelled to fight a bad law i am now compelled to focus on sharing the knowledge gained from that battle with my associates and new born entrepreneurs
4215390 buckle of the bible belt and those that tried to define describe dictate formulate censor and legislate the things they think are obscene
4215391 these projects consume a lot of my time and income so the decision to sell the stores would allow focus on the projects and the capital needed to launch a new product line and self publish a book

4215393 i have to tell you in the ten years ive been doing antiques roadshow these are the finest things ive ever seen
4215394 im just im just blown away i really am well theyre real treasures and im so pleased that we have retained them and they can be passed down through the generations
4215395 you couldnt ask for anything better i waited for this piece and i knew it was going to go higher than the estimate the size is so overpowering theyre usually three or four inches shorter and hardly ever decorated its just absolutely gorgeous
4215396 i think its fabulous i know its top of the line
4215397 paul started collecting in 1945 and had the best of everything
4215398 he was an artist and illustrator who did covers for mens magazines like true and argosy he was sent on assignment to places where he collected he also collected in new york city where he had a studio when warren robbins wrote his book african art in american collections 1966 there were more objects in it from pauls collection than from anybody elses
4215399 like a magician paul orchestrated our encounters i never knew what fabulous objects i might see or which ones hed make available he seldom showed me everything he had instead he presented a few choice artifacts while he kept others hidden away to dazzle me at a later time
4215400 collectors are clamoring for the best of the northwest coast
4215401 the whole phone bank was closed off on the leggings
4215402 i had a lot of interest from overseas buyers in paris and belgium one reason being the value of the euro over the dollar its a global market to be sure and perhaps always has been for tribal arts but the competition for the best objects seems to be getting fiercer
4215403 there are just not a lot of options for pre columbian anymore
4215404 there are other venues but they tend to reserve things high
4215405 and while i did very well with this group im going to be getting fussier in accepting pre columbian consignments in the future
4215406 nobody had ever polished it it was all original the buckle the leather they just dont show up like that anymore
4215407 i saw it on line last night and rushed over this morning to have a look it is a gem
4215408 we find this works well because many collectors dont care where or when the picture was painted they are just collecting art from all periods and places
4215409 historical works portraits nineteenth century still lifes and some landscapes pictures that show off well with american furniture go in our americana sales the next americana sale is in late november the next doyle auction of contemporary european and american art is in early november
4215410 there seems to be more money than ever chasing art
4215411 what youre seeing in the art market is symptomatic of the unprecedented wealth in the hands of the new billionaires for the first time ever the number of billionaires identified by forbes has reached four figures one thousand one hundred twelve in 2008 and forty two percent are americans it is no wonder that the skys the limit when it comes to setting record prices for the best art the time may come when some of them may lose their money in a volatile market but now they are riding high
4215412 i think we have to look to the economy on that the world moves so fast i dont see it as part of a trend i do see it as the art market at that level reacting to the financial news
4215413 one of the first things that new buyers buy is the artwork of their country and heritage
4215414 thats the first phase of a new market buying style once that has been sated then that money will go into buying artworks from other realms including european and american i think in time the market will reinvent itself as it always does

4215434 well see what happens right now everybodys kind of right where we thought they would be
4215435 that would be our hope with all those guys that they got some work in in the preseason

4215437 thats what the hope is for all of those guys
4215438 tom santi is about ready to come back to practice and i imagine peyton would be a couple of weeks behind him
4215439 as far as being on target and having no real setbacks hes doing fine hes staying active and at some point hell get the ok

4215514 i grew up on the he man cartoon and watched he man six days a week the notion that i think we most took from the cartoon are the characters and trying to find a way that is true to them
4215515 now at the same time we had to come up with why that is the way it is i mean youre talking about sword and sandal meets science fiction meets fantasy meets everything and how does that all kind of blend into the same world and so we had to come up with very specific rules that explained why trapjaw looks the way he looks and why cyclops who is awesome looks the way he looks
4215516 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him

4215574 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4215575 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
4215576 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4215577 i can understand why people are very upset and why theyre very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices
4215578 it does bother me that much of that is directed at us our job is to provide energy to provide it in a means that is reliable and we hope we can provide it in a means thats convenient as well to the consumer
4215579 i dont think theres any question that if these prices 3 50 4 a gallon for gasoline and the follow through effects on the cost of electricity are causing a lot of problems for a lot of americans their budgets just are very difficult for them to accommodate this
4215580 what we can do is add new supply and to provide means for people to use the energy more efficiently which will help reduce demand
4215581 and thats what were spending a lot of our effort doing is working on both sides of the demand equation and the supply equation
4215582 things like providing lighter weight tires tires that retain their pressure more efficiently lighter weight plastics to go into vehicles to reduce vehicle weight
4215583 not realistic for the united states or almost any other country
4215584 im not sure that its even desirable for the united states to pursue that as a goal

4215586 people see the 5 homes i have the 17 hummers and all my gold chains and just assume i have a lot of money that just isnt the case im broke too
4215587 sir is it true that your company is making 4 000 in profit a second
4215588 hell no in fact we actually lose 5 000 a second yeah so take that
4215589 but if youre losing all this money than how do you explain the fact that you have indisputibly made a record profit
4215590 that might be the easiest way to answer the question
4215591 the idea is that were a new product and trying to reach out to the community and look at the conventions weve come to expect between dance and performing arts audiences can expect a new look and a call to other artists to not worry so much about defining what they do but to just do it
4215592 i first fell in love with buddy layman in high school when my director at lakota west introduced me to the show
4215593 i discovered what a beautifully tragic and touching story it truly is

4215597 the quality of the work was tremendous with strong submissions in every category which we believe is a testament to the strength of the macs programming and classes because all the entries were so good our decisions were very difficult
4215598 so many people have been cooking at home and eating in
4215599 restaurant week gave them a reason to go out and celebrate
4215600 my husband and i visited savona for the first time during restaurant week it will definitely not be our last visit my husband had the chicken alfredo and i had the grouper with the pesto aioli yum the berry tiramisus were a lovely finish to a delicious and well paced dinner on a busy night
4215601 we ate at rudys in germantown and it was great good service wonderful food atmosphere was great the sampler platter dinner with seven different meats was great
4215602 a group of wine loving friends dined in the lauberge main dining room for their 34 restaurant week special it was fantastic first we were served a demitasse of perfectly flavorful and refreshing cold green pea soup then a delectable lobster ravioli this was followed by a fabulous and beautiful yellow beet and cucumber salad the main course was amazing a choice of tournedos of beef tenderloin or mediterranean sea bass filleted tableside then a choice of desserts either creme brulee or chocolate lava cake it was a most fabulous evening
4215603 a group went to jays late friday night despite the late hour and despite the fact that the kitchen and staff had been frantically busy all week i have to say everything was impeccable the service the quality of the food the attention to detail the wine service it was all perfect chef justin whites gazpacho was unparalleled
4215604 one of our favorite weeks of the year is sadly behind us but the memory of good food and attentive service lingers on we dined at carvers cena savona rue dumaine cafe boulevard and flemings it was great to see some new and highly rated participants this year and we do hope they will continue in the future considering the caliber of the restaurants and the excellent value with a donation to charity thrown in we are offering only thanks and not criticism
4215605 we tried benhams which i had previously thought was just a catering service the orzo salad was excellent and my husband described the watermelon gazpacho as interesting in a good way we both had the tenderloin mashed potatoes and green beans we also had our 6 month old son along and the staff was accommodating and gracious i suspect that wouldnt have been the case everywhere
4215606 wiley and crew at meadowlark always do a neat job with interesting ingredients
4215607 we chose flemings prime steakhouse and had a wonderful dining experience the wedge salad was crisp and the blue cheese dressing was a good choice three of us ordered the filet oscar and i opted for the chicken saltimbocca the four of us were very pleased with our entree for dessert we wanted the creme brulee but they had run out of the individual size so our waitress came back with two of the normal sizes and we split them what a great way to please the customer crunchy top and all this was a first time visit for two of us and we loved it
4215608 i dined at chins ginger grill in tipp city my salad consisted of fresh salmon eggs romaine lettuce and blue cheese for the main course i had the flank steak with the rice and chinese vegetables for dessert i had the ginger ice cream the meal and the service were both very good
4215609 visited figlios on monday they have a single choice menu but they made great choices in particular the chicken picatta is excellent creme brulee seems to be the dessert of choice for the week this one was very good tuesday night we visited caffe anticoli we both tried the crabcake and both were happy with our choices we selected the delmonico steak marsala and icelandic codfish for the main course the codfish was the better choice
4215610 three of us ate at cocos last night we tried all three entrees the pork tenderloin the chicken breast and the shrimp linguine all came with salads and all were very good but the star of the show was the fried spinach which accompanied the chicken breast the mac and cheese with the pork was also very good all in all it was one of the best meals weve had recently
4215611 six members of my family went to caf boulevard on an evening nice enough to sit in their lovely courtyard service was absolutely impeccable despite the widely divergent palates at the table the varied restaurant week menu pleased everyone caf boulevard did a great job and we all left perfectly happy
4215612 i returned to cena out at the dayton malls attempted greene area

4215618 weve reevaluated our convention hall space and come up with some solutions that will allow us to offer 3 000 more tickets for sale we know this will not be enough to satisfy the very high level of demand for tickets this year but we want to ensure that blizzcon remains a great experience for those of you who are able to attend
4215619 they are steeped in vintage music from evocative krautrock to deep soul with wafts of early human league synth floydian englishness and the throbbing groove of tom tom club all filtered for modern times
4215620 most vulnerable low income children are covered first without moving them from private to public coverage
4215621 there is no assimilation of immigrants into the franchise and at least since the1950s the melting pot analogy does not apply to american democracy
4215622 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly today s players love it
4215623 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
4215624 this is a bold decision and i think it s a great one
4215625 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
4215626 as administrators it isn t our place to change things without adequate input for the past two years we ve received feedback from all constituencies we ve also been given a direction to make decisions that reward speed creativity and skill while maintaining the games safety and integrity by allowing shootouts the rules committee gave conferences a means to enhance game excitement we are always careful when making changes as there can be unintended consequences in this case the ccha council was comfortable that shootouts will have no direct impact on the rpi and also felt that shootouts are in the best interest of the game at this time
4215627 i m excited about our league adopting it and it s going to add a tremendous amount of excitement to the game
4215628 fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so they re going to love doing it in a game so it s a win win situation when you look at it from that perspective
4215629 shootouts are going to be great for our fans they will keep people excited and in their seats right up until the last goal or save it s going to be something that they will keep talking and raving about
4215630 a shootout may be conducted at the end of the five minute overtime period for advancement purposes in conference games or by mutual consent of both teams
4215631 we urge the government to restore the original cabinet order rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4215632 the court orders need to be complied with the mandate of the legislation has to be obeyed
4215633 democratic forces in pakistan have come together to defeat dictatorship
4215634 violation of the constitution and gross misconduct is almost complete and we just have to give the finishing touches to it
4215635 should a person who has reduced pakistan to this condition be given safe passage they ask for safe passage after breaking the law and violating the constitution selling out the countrys sovereignty ruining the country and making the people poor

4215639 security in the city has been increased after the recent bomb blasts in ahmedabad and bangalore all police officials have been directed to be on high alert

4215641 there were lots of people who walked on and then there was a long fight and after that we got independence
4215642 it was a sort of emptiness you climb the mountain and there is nothing at the top
4215643 when you work so hard to achieve something and you get it at the end there is a feeling of emptiness but then life goes on
4215644 the entire range of colour dreamz products have been priced 10 12 per cent cheaper than the leading brands which would help the company acquire a sizeable share of the rs 20 000 crore domestic paint market agarwal added

4215653 this is information about a ballistic missile attack this area is being targeted for attack
4215654 we are targeting a turnover of rs 1 000 crore by 2010 11 and then would take it further to rs 2 500 crore by 2013 14 the increase would come on the basis of our expanding business in both our glass and ceramic businesses
4215655 this would take our total glass production to 18 lakh tonnes our existing glass facility also in andhra pradesh has an annual capacity of 10 lakh tonnes
4215656 we always have a back up for supply from other warehouses in case there is some problem in any particular warehouse
4215657 we dont think that the need will arise since we are appealing to the bombay high court at the earliest and are confident that the matter will be resolved soon
4215658 we have a total of three warehouses in maharashtra pune nagpur and mumbai comprising around three lakh square feet
4215659 the pttc will strengthen transgenic research for crop improvement by providing a platform building synergies among institutions icrisat director general william dar said
4215660 icrisat will continue to harness transgenic research to solve problems that cannot be solved through conventional breeding
4215661 translate transgenic technology and harness its products to meet the needs of agriculture growth
4215662 the attack would not hinder the positive steps that have been taken to return the country to normalcy

4215664 there is an understanding between the pakistan peoples party led coalition and musharraf on the president resigning before impeachment proceedings begin in earnest against him
4215665 we are being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4215666 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
4215667 we have tied up with 15 20 people dealing in scraps in each of the cities that we are present
4215668 ever since we have started accepting 15 20 year old cars exchange has gone up from 12 per cent to 20 per cent and it has helped an entry level product like alto to become a replacement model
4215669 avneet needs experience and think she was not prepared enough of course none expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4215670 i expected her to shoot 580 plus she was under pressure and this is surely disappointing when you see her score against her ability

4215672 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill

4215674 there are untested forces like the dmdk of film actor vijayakanth the party has taken note of the aiadmk leaders readiness for an alliance with the left and the dmk leaders call that secular forces should come together is also in mind
4215675 we are observing tamil nadu politics closely we have to study and analyse before making a decision about an alliance in the state
4215676 we recommended to the government of india that kashmiri pandits should be treated as minorities and extended all facilities applicable to such groups
4215677 indian team is on an upswing they played football reminiscent of what india used to play two decades ago from sunil chhetri to gouramangi everybody played well
4215678 i have not seen india beating a strong team by that margin in any final it seemed the players have shed the fear factor of playing in big tournaments full credit to the players and the coach
4215679 we are going to play the likes of south korea japan and saudi arabia so we need preparations houghton is doing a great job now and he should be given another term or extend his current contract till 2011

4215685 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4215686 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4215687 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4215688 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4215689 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4215698 the ivy league game of the week presented by tiaa cref
4215699 the entire ivy league community is thrilled to have the heart of our football season broadcast nationally this year by versus and we appreciate strong support to make it possible our students and home communities and our alumni around the country as well as college football fans everywhere will be able to watch top notch football and celebrate great rivalries
4215700 ivy league football has an incredible legacy supported by a passionate fan base and we are thrilled to now have the opportunity to present these historic rivalries to a national audience
4215701 the addition of five ivy league games to the networks 2008 schedule will undoubtedly help solidify versus position as a top television destination for college football
4215702 the key thing is that the process will be fully automated so there is no requirement for a skilled person
4215703 bumblebees are a critical pollinator of a lot of the fruits and vegetables we eat every day
4215704 they are linked to a lot of crops we depend on without the bees we would require manual pollination but it wouldnt take long before wed have to completely take some of the crops out of our diet
4215705 the disease spillover from domesticated bumblebees contributes to the decline of the wild bumblebee population but we are not suggesting it is the only factor at play
4215706 whether one is a predominant factor is too early to say
4215707 coming off a much improved season i think that in everything we do were thinking about a mac championship
4215708 its not a sprint its a marathon its 20 games and every game counts
4215709 the winning environment we have established will continue to carry us forward
4215710 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4215711 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4215712 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4215713 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4215714 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible

4215721 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4215722 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4215723 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4215724 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4215725 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4215726 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4215727 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4215728 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4215729 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4215730 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4215731 this rally will be part of a massive outpouring of protest in denver and minneapolis against the two corporate controlled parties and their policies of perpetual militarism and war
4215732 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4215733 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4215734 senator i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine youre no jack kennedy
4215735 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4215736 what next how do i live fully and restore the planet in the process
4215737 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4215738 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4215739 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4215740 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4215741 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4215742 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4215743 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4215744 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4215745 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4215746 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4215747 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4215748 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4215749 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4215750 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4215751 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4215752 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4215753 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4215754 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4215755 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4215756 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4215757 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4215758 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4215759 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4215760 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4215761 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4215762 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4215763 who are open to doing something on the production side
4215764 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4215765 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4215766 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4215767 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4215768 were just trying to see the situation on the ground
4215769 we need to take some bold transformative steps we need to find some potential areas to invest and see some long term dividends
4215770 we need almost a new deal type investment in alternative resources
4215771 honey ive been here for 85 years i would never leave
4215772 i see where the hope and potential is you have a system in place here
4215773 the problems that used to be associated with places like detroit or toledo are now felt across the board
4215774 pledged to bring a colorful call to end the wars in iraq and afghanistan while drawing the connection to the global climate crisis
4215775 resist a two party system that allows imperialism and racism to continue unrestrained
4215776 organize militant direct action that manifests opposition to both the democratic and republican parties
4215777 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4215778 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4215779 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4215780 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4215781 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4215782 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4215783 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4215784 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4215785 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4215786 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4215787 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4215788 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4215789 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4215790 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4215791 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4215792 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4215793 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4215794 proponents ot prop 8 genuinely endorse the existing civil unions
4215795 removing the right of children to be raised by both of their natural parents
4215796 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4215797 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4215798 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4215799 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4215800 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4215801 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4215802 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4215803 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4215804 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4215805 its going to be a whos who of the convention
4215806 the denver school of the arts in colorado pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
4215807 you have to declare a party affiliation to vote in the primaries and that concerns me
4215808 are you afraid im going to register as a communist
4215809 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4215810 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4215811 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4215812 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4215813 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4215814 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4215815 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4215816 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4215817 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4215818 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4215819 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4215820 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4215821 we feel at the moment a greater concern for our safety
4215822 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west
4215823 it seems that the americans have changed their view due to the situation in the caucasus
4215824 in the eyes of washington this conflict has proved that russia isnt a stable partner and continues to consider its international surroundings as its exclusive sphere of influence
4215825 with russian tanks rolling into georgia theres a feeling among former eastern bloc states that the tanks could roll over their borders too theres a certain urgency now
4215826 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4215827 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4215828 bob was given notice of the marriage and there is no issue peaches is not flying out there for a showdown but to join the rest of her family on holiday
4215829 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4215830 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4215831 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4215832 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4215833 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4215834 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4215835 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4215836 barack obama said today he wouldn t raise taxes on anyone over 70 and mccain said obama was just pandering to the youth vote
4215837 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4215838 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4215839 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4215840 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4215841 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4215842 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4215843 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4215844 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4215845 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4215846 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4215847 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4215848 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4215849 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4215850 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4215851 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4215852 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4215853 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4215854 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4215855 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4215856 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4215857 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4215858 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4215859 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4215860 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4215861 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4215862 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4215863 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4215864 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4215865 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4215866 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4215867 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4215868 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4215869 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4215870 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4215871 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4215872 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4215873 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4215874 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4215875 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4215876 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4215877 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4215878 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4215879 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4215880 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4215881 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4215882 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4215883 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4215884 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4215885 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4215886 we all have a right to our own opinion including todd
4215887 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4215888 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4215889 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4215890 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4215891 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4215892 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4215893 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4215894 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4215895 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4215896 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4215897 who will be the next president of the united states
4215898 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4215899 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4215900 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4215901 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4215902 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4215903 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4215904 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4215905 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4215906 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4215907 just so you all know we did set a record
4215908 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4215909 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4215910 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4215911 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
4215912 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4215913 yes i am saying and it is true that georgia had the legal and morally justifiable right to use force and launch attacks to preserve their union
4215914 seems like president bush has more on the ball environmentally speaking than al gore does
4215915 and that is why democrats cannot seem to connect with joe q public
4215916 in the here and now in the eyes of joe q public the gop is better suited to lead
4215917 the fear mongering human caused global warming hysterics would have everyone believe that any global warming is bad they conveniently ignore all the actual benefits that a little warming would bring
4215918 and yet if edwards was a republican the left blogosphere would be all over it like white on rice
4215919 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4215920 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4215921 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4215922 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4215923 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4215924 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4215925 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4215926 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4215927 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4215928 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4215929 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4215930 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4215931 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4215932 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4215933 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4215934 at each gannett property based on financial targets and performances
4215935 the mclean va based company publishes more than 80 dailies including usa today and 900 non dailies
4215936 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
4215937 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4215938 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4215939 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4215940 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4215941 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4215942 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4215943 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4215944 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4215945 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4215946 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4215947 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4215948 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4215949 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4215950 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4215951 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4215952 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4215953 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4215954 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4215955 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4215956 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4215957 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4215958 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4215959 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4215960 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4215961 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4215962 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4215963 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4215964 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4215965 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4215966 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4215967 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4215968 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4215969 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4215970 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4215971 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4215972 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4215973 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4215974 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4215975 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4215976 i didnt see it and i dont care to see it if john wayne were alive hed be rolling over in his grave
4215977 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4215978 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4215979 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4215980 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4215981 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4215982 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4215983 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4215984 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4215985 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4215986 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4215987 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4215988 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4215989 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4215990 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4215991 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4215992 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4215993 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4215994 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4215995 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4215996 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4215997 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4215998 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4215999 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4216000 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4216001 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4216002 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4216003 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4216004 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4216005 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4216006 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4216007 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4216008 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4216009 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4216010 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4216011 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4216012 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4216013 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4216014 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4216015 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4216016 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4216018 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4216019 in america every citizens vote should count the court has tossed aside one of the most important rights we have as americans
4216020 oregon voters deserve to be heard on this referendum more than enough oregonians signed the petitions for it the people didnt thwart this effort government bureaucracy did that is a dangerous precedent for the future of the democratic process in america
4216021 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4216022 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4216023 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4216024 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4216025 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4216026 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4216027 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4216028 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4216029 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4216030 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4216031 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4216032 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4216033 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
4216034 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself

4216036 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
4216037 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4216038 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4216039 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4216040 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4216041 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4216042 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4216043 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4216044 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4216045 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4216046 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4216047 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4216048 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4216049 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4216050 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4216051 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4216052 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4216053 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4216054 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4216055 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4216056 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4216057 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4216058 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4216059 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4216060 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4216061 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4216062 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4216063 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4216064 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4216065 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4216066 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4216067 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4216068 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4216069 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4216070 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4216071 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4216072 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4216073 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4216074 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4216075 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4216076 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4216077 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4216078 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4216079 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4216080 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4216081 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4216082 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4216083 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4216084 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4216085 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4216086 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4216087 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4216088 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4216089 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4216090 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4216091 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4216092 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

4216096 wow longer than i expected yay i wonder whats on tv
4216097 i believe that america did the right thing by not joining the kyoto treaty
4216098 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4216099 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4216100 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4216101 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4216102 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4216103 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4216104 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4216105 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4216106 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4216107 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4216108 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4216109 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4216110 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4216111 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4216112 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4216113 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4216114 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4216115 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4216116 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4216117 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4216118 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4216119 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4216120 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4216121 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4216122 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4216123 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4216124 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

4216136 this looks like a great smart adventurous show that i definitely want to go for
4216137 hey this is my favorite show i think you should try out for it youd be awesome
4216138 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4216139 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4216140 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4216141 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4216142 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4216143 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

4216222 the posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate so that extending or replacing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born
4216223 if human essence is freedom form the wills of others the posthuman is post not because it is necessarily unfree by because there is no a priori way to identify a self will that can be clearly distinguished from an other will

4216226 it is not coincidental that the panopticon abstracts power out of the bodies of disciplinarians into a universal disembodied gaze on the contrary it is precisely this move that gives the panopticon its force for when the bodies of the disciplinarians seem to disappear into the technology the limitations of corporeality are hidden
4216227 embodiment cannot exist without a material structure that always deviates in some measure form its abstract representations an incorporating practice cannot exist without an embodied creature to enact it a creature who always deviates in some measure from the norms
4216228 habit is a knowledge and a remembering in the hands and in the body and in the cultivation of habit it is our body which understands
4216229 incorporating practices perform the bodily content inscribing practices correct and modulate the performance
4216230 every group will entrust to bodily automatisms the values and categories which they are most anxious to conserve they will know how well the past can be kept in mind by a habitual memory sedimented in the body
4216231 conventionally artificial life is divided into three research fronts wetware is the attempt to create artificial biological life through such techniques as building components of unicellular organisms in test tubes hardware is the construction of robots and other embodied life forms software is the creation of computer programs instantiating emergent or evolutionary processes
4216232 artificial life is the study of man made systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems it complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life like behaviors within computers and other artificial media by extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbon chain life that has evolved on earth artificial life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating life as we know it with in the larger picture of life as it could be
4216233 by positioning al as a second instance of life researchers affect the definition of biological life as well for now it is the juxtaposition that determines what counts as fundamental not carbon based forms by themselves
4216234 when the self is envisioned as grounded in presence identified with originary guarantees and teleological trajectories associated with solid foundations and logical coherence the posthuman is likely to be seen as antihuman because it envisions the conscious mind as a small subsystem running its program of self construction and self assurance while remaining ignorant of the actual dynamics of complex systems
4216235 we welcome the official closure of the bottling plant which we had demanded we will now hold coca cola accountable for the damages they have caused in the area because of their negligence
4216236 community campaigns in india have shut down coca cola bottling plants in plachimada and in balia and now we will ensure that coca cola bottling plants in mehdiganj and kala dera also meet the same fate
4216237 the coca cola company has chosen to embark on an ambitious public relations drive to paint a green image of itself globally but track record on the ground in india is one of dismal environmental and human rights problems and no amount of public relations can solve the problems it continues to create in india

4216246 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
4216247 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
4216248 the ce industry is a backbone of economic activity in this country
4216249 in a tough economy consumers turn to ce products for many reasons from entertaining in the home to telecommuting to save gas such factors and access to global consumers through free trade help the ce industry to flourish while growth rates of other industries have either stalled or declined consumers dont want to live without ce products and continue to crave the latest gadgets and innovations our industry has to offer

4216259 despite having recent seizures more than one out of three adults reported not seeing a neurologist or epilepsy specialist in the past year these findings suggest that adults with uncontrolled seizures may not be receiving the optimal medical treatment they need and may face substantial impairments in their daily activities
4216260 while epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions most people know very little about this disorder or how to support those with epilepsy
4216261 we hope this report which provides the largest and most comprehensive data on epilepsy in the united states can help states and public health agencies better understand the prevalence of epilepsy as well as epilepsy associated conditions and limitations
4216262 we wouldve been already thrown out of the olympics at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions they wont do anything to them its a double standard

4216265 apple which has refused to acknowledge there is a problem with the iphones performance declined to comment for this story
4216266 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4216267 whatever the cause connection problems are a big disappointment for customers who bought the iphone 3g precisely because of its promise of more reliable net access
4216268 im so sick of hearing people say turn off 3g
4216269 uh why pay an extra 10 for at amp ts iphone plan and get a new phone that is advertised to just work then i returned my iphone 3g because the iphone 3g stinks in my opinion i went back to my original iphone

4216272 there are challenges that arise but its not aging per se thats the issue a decline in sexuality may be the canary in the mineshaft sexual problems may manifest before high blood pressure
4216273 sexual health is a harbinger of physical and mental health and it plays an important role in the quality of life
4216274 older people dont just drop out of the picture in general if youre healthy you can be sexually active
4216275 dont assume that because youre older your sex life has to be gone if youre healthy and connected to someone and youve had a pretty good sex life when youre younger then you can have a pretty good sex life in old age
4216276 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4216277 air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
4216278 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4216279 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
4216280 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
4216281 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
4216282 so now we put all this together and it raises the possibility that alzheimers is much more of a public health issue than previously thought if it turns out that being weak is a sign of its onset
4216283 but if so we also now have a clue as to how we can possibly intervene perhaps by treating motor dysfunction years before people develop dementia so that they wont develop dementia as early
4216284 this study really ties together two very common syndromes in aging cognitive processes and motor skills in ways i have not seen them connected before
4216285 so i think this is very important and relevant because it raises the question of whether frailty could be an early manifestation of alzheimers disease the study doesnt necessarily answer the question and this is something they now have to go about proving but already for me that idea is a whole new thought that will push me to look at my patients with new eyes
4216286 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
4216287 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
4216288 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
4216289 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support
4216290 these factors do not come into play for men who overall are 7 percent more likely to cheat than women
4216291 the likelihood of a man having had an affair increases with age and reaches a peak when a man is about 55 years old it then decreases with age for women the peak is 45 years old
4216292 the benefits of female infidelity reduce after the age of 40 because a woman would no longer benefit in terms of improved gene quality from the affair
4216293 men also experience a reduction of sperm quality around the age of 45 but the reproductive benefits of an affair extend further into a mans lifetime than a womans
4216294 the gradient of time in the country and being born in the country or outside the country has a lot to do with how people perceive and experience the health care system and especially the deficits of that system
4216295 if you compare these numbers to those from the u s centers for disease control and prevention latinos are more than twice as likely to lack a usual health care provider
4216296 we found a number of characteristics of health care access that are particular to latinos
4216297 among people who have health insurance 19 percent lacked a usual health care provider compared to 42 percent of people who lack health insurance
4216298 this suggests that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from doctors
4216299 among those people who reported they were not satisfied with their health care the most common reason why they received poor health care was financial
4216300 they felt that their health care professional did not provide good care because they did not have the means to pay for the health care
4216301 about a third of hispanics get their medical information from doctors
4216302 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
4216303 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
4216304 women who are having menopausal symptoms in their 50s can continue to take tibolone because it is relatively safe and also does have other benefits such as a reduction in the risk of
4216305 it will not be available in the united states because the company is not asking the u s food and drug administration to approve it
4216306 all drugs that are being used for menopausal symptoms all have positives and negatives the task is to find drugs that dont have problems
4216307 for the u s consumer its sort of a moot point
4216308 it tibolone is not the magic bullet but i think its another drug that could potentially be used if it ever does get fda approval my caution would be that its potentially helpful but its not a slam dunk that its better than what we have been using
4216309 after extensive monitoring estimated exposures to golfers following full applications of two turfgrass insecticides that are used throughout the northeastern united states were 19 to 68 times lower than levels set by the u s environmental protection agency designed to protect human health
4216310 because of the large amount of time people spend in turf environments exposure to pesticides from treated turf is a potentially significant exposure pathway
4216311 to consume 10 000 calories a day he would need to be eating all day long
4216312 athletes need fat but they need to be selective about the type of fat and whenever possible choose unsaturated fats such as olive or canola oil avocados nuts and seeds
4216313 we encourage athletes to eat foods that are high in calories and small in volume so granola with fruit and yogurt would be a better choice than flake cereal with milk
4216314 within 15 minutes of finishing a race phelps should eat a small meal of two thirds carbs and one third protein with a little healthy fat to start and optimize the recovery process
4216315 the findings of this study confirm the importance of a diet rich in dairy and other protein sources on adolescent bone mass
4216316 having had an std roughly quadruples a womans odds of reporting sexual pain and triples her lubrication problems
4216317 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment

4216938 the central issue that the gma does not expect or require a county to revise every aspect of its comprehensive plan when it does its seven year update was the key issue we were asking the court to examine
4216939 we think the decision was well thought out and respectful of the goals that the state gma intended to achieve
4216940 we believe it assures cities and property owners that certainty and predictability are essential values of the gma

4216953 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4216954 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4216955 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4216956 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line

4216981 1 dont bet on georgia showing up for the national title game the bulldogs are a great team i love their roster top to bottom what i dont like at all is their schedule road games at south carolina arizona state lsu kentucky and auburn in addition to home bouts against florida and tennessee will do the bulldogs in great team terrible schedule
4216982 2 dont bet on virginia tech running the table despite their cake schedule this one is going to get me killed by fellow friends and alumni the hokies have a ridiculously easy schedule this season their toughest game is a tossup between at nebraska or at florida state other than that they play the likes of furman western kentucky maryland and duke so why will they not go 12 0 they return only 10 starters have completely new receivers a brewing controversy at quarterback and a mediocre at best offense plus they like to choke in november so dont get too excited if they start off 8 0 ive seen that script before and it doesnt end well trust me
4216983 3 dont bet on usc beating ohio state despite playing at home usc quarterback mark sanchez will be coming back from the knee injury and will be facing one of the toughest defenses in the country ohio state is returning 20 starters from last season and is primed to show up again in the bcs title game i just gagged a little thinking about that
4216984 4 dont bet on the sec being represented in the title game without a doubt the best conference in the country anyone who argues that is just kidding themselves however being the best could end up hurting them as teams will eliminate themselves from national title contention courtesy of their brutal head to head matchups i like seeing sec teams in title games personally but dont foresee that happening this year
4216985 5 dont bet on missouri being left out of the title game i didnt know how to word that one obviously what im saying is i think missouri is going to be playing for the title when its all said and done chase daniels is a solid leader and the tigers schedule isnt as brutal as sec teams a road matchup with texas on october 18th could determine how likely this bet is to come true if the tigers can pull that one out i dont see them losing the rest of the way and have them on a head on collision with ohio state
4216986 6 dont bet on penn state losing more than two games the nittany lions return 20 starters just like ohio state ironically enough one of the teams i have them losing to is ohio state played in columbus on october 25th the other is at wisconsin vegas has the over under win total set to 8 5 for penn state take the over
4216987 7 dont bet on notre dame missing a bowl game the irish return 18 starters this year and have a favorable schedule with their two toughest games being at michigan state and at usc though they will drop both of those i see the irish winning 9 out of their 12 games including drumroll a week two win against michigan call me crazy i probably am

4216992 die angreifer waren nicht uniformiert und haben uns in eine falle gelockt
4216993 die kommenden tage und monate entscheiden ber die zukunft der us russischen beziehungen meine pers nliche meinung ist dass russlands vorgehen gegen einen souver nen staat folgen haben muss
4216994 weit reichende folgen f r den weiteren verlauf unserer sicherheitspolitischen beziehungen
4216995 die unterst tzung f r die demokratisch gew hlte regierung
4216996 ich gehe davon aus dass die russen verstanden haben dass den bogen zu berspannen tief greifende folgen f r ihre stellung im internationalen staatensystem haben wird
4216997 ich sehe keinerlei perspektiven f r die anwendung milit rischer gewalt durch die usa ist das klar genug

4217000 although we have not yet seen the text of the joint business agreement today s announcement is problematic on several fronts
4217001 for example the scope clause in our current collective bargaining agreement does not include an exception for a joint business agreement between american airlines and another airline management therefore needs apa s consent before this joint business agreement can go forward
4217002 today s announcement illustrates that american airlines management can negotiate complex agreements on a timely basis when they want to do so
4217003 it s indicative of management s misplaced priorities that they aren t willing to apply the same sense of urgency toward negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with their employees
4217004 moreover it seems to us that management should focus first on running a more reliable operation before embarking on a new venture of this magnitude and complexity
4217005 our airline unfortunately continues to lag the industry to an embarrassing degree in key customer service metrics such as on time performance
4217006 that said we understand clearly why the other carriers would want to link up with american airlines the u s aviation market is the world s largest and most lucrative
4217007 and that s precisely why we have such serious concerns apa agrees with both john mccain and barack obama we oppose any scheme that jeopardizes american jobs
4217008 make no mistake we want american airlines to succeed but that success cannot come at the expense of the employees
4217009 we have serious job security concerns that must be addressed as part of any revenue producing agreement with another airline
4217010 all these workers are asking for is family health care coverage and a wage that will make it a bit easier for them to provide for their families
4217011 the aerospace industry is making billions of dollars but those of us who clean their buildings are barely surviving
4217012 we don t have enough for housing food and gas we don t have basic health care for our families
4217013 we are pleased to report continued improvement in our core earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior year and the second quarter of fiscal 2008 in this challenging liquidity and credit environment we continue to closely monitor asset quality which continues to remain strong with non performing assets at 0 4 of total assets
4217014 we have previously announced that revenue in our core business would remain steady in a range of 4 0 million to 4 5 million per quarter for the first three quarters of this year we are pleased to report that revenue for the quarter ended june 30 2008 was within this range and that revenue for the first six months of this year was also within this range in addition as we announced earlier this year we are in the process of introducing new products that we believe will help us increase our revenues by the fourth quarter of this year i am pleased to announce that we have added several significant products already this year
4217015 while we are always pleased to have large sales such as the sale to the u s army which occurred in 2007 we believe that our core business will continue to grow particularly as our new products gain market acceptance
4217016 hydrogen engine center continues to move toward its goal of leading the way toward a carbon free economy our product line is gaining traction and our sales team is building a successful track record
4217017 we believe that our third quarter results will improve on those of the comparable periods last year and that 2008 will be our strongest performance since inception we plan to be more involved in the distributed generation market as governmentally imposed emission standards tighten and the clean energy solutions offered by our intellectual property develop and become accepted in the market place we also plan to aggressively market our carbon reduced and carbon free products during the remainder of 2008

4217021 the national forests of southern california support a globally significant concentration of wildlife and plants and are a popular destination for millions of people seeking relief from the concrete jungle
4217022 yet the forest service ignores these values and treats most of this land as if it were worthy only of development for urban infrastructure or other exploitation
4217023 instead of managing these forests for the public who actually own and use this land the bush administration plans to axe protections for pristine and scenic landscapes sacrificing important wildlife habitat for the benefit of a few corporations
4217024 its sad that this administration continues to think that making big corporations rich is its first responsibility
4217025 the forest service missed an important opportunity to improve the ecological health of southern californias forest ecosystems
4217026 opening up the most pristine areas to off road vehicles and resource exploitation without considering essential habitats and the species that depend on them is a clear violation of federal environmental law
4217027 we like to test their courage every once in a while they did a nice job they passed

4217054 it was mostly playing when we were younger that was before when there werent as many wharfs there

4217077 in light of the tools available to allow viewers to choose what cable speech to hear and not here the government cannot possibly establish that content based restrictions on such speech pass first amendment muster
4217078 this was clearly a very ugly incident and is completely in contradiction to the assurances that the chinese made about media freedom during the olympics
4217079 facebook is a tremendous organization and i would not leave it if it were not for a great opportunity
4217080 our concern was that it creates tremendous confusion for people to get one notice and then another
4217081 im sure they are doing this because the courts dont currently have jurisdiction over the dmhc
4217082 what we have tried to do is to offer enrollees options
4217083 they are not heeding the sentiments for change that people expressed in the vote
4217084 of course theyre not going to admit our lawsuit played a role but of course it motivated the change

4217394 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4217395 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4217404 they let you sling these old police cars around a track and show you things you didnt know you could do with a car
4217405 i learned a lot in hollywood the j turns bootleg turns flipping the car off the highway from behind
4217406 it is a phenomenal automobile its one of the best cars ever made
4217407 i dont even put petrol in our ford anglia car which is 43 years old because i think that is so unladylike
4217408 i do all the cleaning ironing washing and cooking and martin puts up shelves and looks after the car hes the breadwinner and i create a lovely and loving environment for him
4217409 i do work part time but only because we need the money however we still have clearly defined roles in the home and i am the one who does most of the cooking and cleaning
4217410 it may sound silly but living like this really does make me happier as though im existing in one of those old fashioned tv shows where everything is always wonderful my despair at the modern world is one of the reasons why we havent had children i would be terrified they would be offered drugs or become the victims of violence
4217411 sorry mijn vriendin zit thuis met een kopje thee te wachten
4217412 i dont think there is any way to calculate a number percentage of similarity in the end its a political and social and cultural thing about how we see our differences
4217413 she wrote that her life became an ordeal after her family members grew suspicious about her after a religious discussion with them she said that her brother found some christian articles written by her as well as a cross sign on her computer screen since then he started to insult her and blamed the internet for pushing her to change her religion

4217417 what is striking about these images is how lightly muscled the athletes bodies appear how fine in proportion and aesthetically balanced and how unlike so many of those on view in these games bodies that even in real time seem digitally enhanced
4217418 its one chance every four years to get out an image of a healthy athletic woman instead of an underweight underage model athletes bodies are much healthier and theyre functional

4217423 if abc and disney refuse to repudiate the contents of the davine memo then producers in both the u
4217424 producers might even be persuaded by mr davines memo to be inspired by the general underlying premise of a well known disney cartoon character
4217425 in the spirit of the memo the rip off rodent might be called tricky mouse
4217426 often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
4217427 let me assure you that we continue to be actively competitively and aggressively engaged in developing product based on foreign formats and our decision whether or not to get into negotiations will be premised purely on creative need and our legal analysis as to whether underlying rights are required
4217428 frapa and the international tv production industry have waited in vain for abc and or disney to respond to howard davines memo
4217429 in frapas view the davine memo can be seen to be encouraging abc producers and show runners not to license formats honestly if this is found to be the case frapa will do everything in its power to help protect the property of its members in the international creative community
4217430 i dont think it does abc any good in the marketplace
4217431 they might not get first look at the best product

4217478 theres been an outpouring of resoundingly positive feedback tied to the campaign as people relate to the profiles featured in our ads
4217479 the goal shared by pemcos marketing partners was to produce a campaign that northwest residents could identify with the awards are truly an honor that we share with the great people who call this region home
4217480 its certainly rewarding to receive local recognition for our commercials and winning these awards for creative distinction from industry peers across the globe is a welcome addition to the encouragement weve received thus far
4217481 im not ready just yet not financially and not personally
4217482 we are elated by the achievements of our manufacturing and regulatory teams in obtaining these key certifications enabling us to supply both u s and european markets with devices manufactured by ats medical
4217483 we are extremely pleased with the markets acceptance of our ats cryomaze products and believe this business will be a primary contributor to the acceleration of revenue growth over the next several years with the integration process behind us we are now able to focus our efforts on manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions and have the flexibility to develop new products on a reduced timeline
4217484 we are grateful that at amp t has again stepped up to the plate and provided this special opportunity to so many area children
4217485 many of these kids are passionate about baseball but have never had an opportunity to go to a game for many this opportunity has been a dream come true
4217486 we are delighted to host todays event which is all about young deserving people enjoying a great day out at the game
4217487 investing in the local community is a key focus for at amp t and todays initiative is another example of our commitment to organizations that serve our regions youth
4217488 this exciting expansion is dedicated to providing our existing customers with the transit service they expect and deserve service that is more convenient and designed to accommodate their needs
4217489 no doubt these new services will attract new customers to our already growing ridership but our prime purpose is to better serve our core customers
4217490 this wonderful expansion of septa service is a direct result of last years passage by the pennsylvania legislature of act 44 which provides long term predictable funding for state wide public transportation
4217491 we again express our appreciation to the many citizens and legislators who championed this historic legislation and especially governor rendell who made it a top priority and fought hard to assure its enactment

4217493 illinois has been a bright spot in the midwest with the strong pace of job growth over the past four to five years but unemployment and the instability of the national job situation has taken a toll on the mindset of workers across the state
4217494 with the fluctuations of the economy its not surprising that more workers are concerned about their personal job situation the good news is that we are still seeing growth in distribution non clinical health care and professional services but its understandable that more workers are cautious about making any moves at this time
4217495 most universities spend a tremendous amount of money to recruit students many spend as much as thirty five percent of their revenue on marketing and advertising they have to keep their tuition high to recover these costs we eliminated these costs by structuring relationships with strategic partners that refer potential students to us therefore we can operate a quality degree granting institution without the escalating tuition and excessive fees deemed necessary by many schools
4217496 do you realize that the cost of higher education has risen as fast as the cost of health care such totally uncontrollable expenditures without any visible improvement in either the content or the quality of education means that the system is rapidly becoming untenable
4217497 we are pleased to provide this cash dividend to reward our loyal shareholders
4217498 this is truly an exciting time for us here at septa

4217522 the space elevator was first proposed in the 1960s as a method of getting into space the initial studies of a space elevator outlined the basic concept of a cable strung between earth and space but concluded that no material available at the time had the required properties to feasibly construct such a cable with the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 it is now possible to realistically discuss the construction of a space elevator although currently produced only in small quantities carbon nanotubes appear to have the strength to mass ratio required for this endeavor however fabrication of the cable required is only one of the challenges in construction of a space elevator powering the climbers surviving micrometeor impacts lightning strikes and low earth orbit debris collisions are some of the problems that are now as important to consider as the production of the carbon nanotube cable we consider various aspects of a space elevator and find each of the problems that this endeavor will encounter can be solved with current or near future technology

4217529 your collar is turned up my dear friend which leads me to believe that you dressed in a hurry
4217530 i was born in 49 a cold war kid in mccarthy times
4217531 theyve begun using specially trained chimps to fight the war in southeast asia the action follows a timid new recruit who accidentally falls in with the experimental apes but as they hump through the damp jungles of vietnam it becomes unclear if these chimps are a stable fighting unit or an erratic and volatile pack of animals the chimps have gone through the u s military machine and are trying to reconcile the ideas and orders that theyve been taught with their innate instinctual drives
4217532 guerillas looks at the nature of war the nature of man and all the grey areas in between its also an action packed thrill ride full of jungle warfare and simian acrobatics
4217533 he is an aimless suburban kid who has gone to war to find himself
4217534 but he soon learns that vietnam is not his fathers war also following the chimps through the jungle is a small unit of u s soldiers they act as a kind of greek chorus who can comment on the controversial situations that unfold
4217535 im trying to allow extra space for more visual storytelling and bigger and more elaborate action sequences
4217536 at the same time im also trying to establish three dimensional characters that act in realistic ways and have complex relationships
4217537 it was a good old fashion war movie that was less about politics and more about cool tank battles
4217538 my mind just visually connected the way the soldiers marched through the bombed out landscape with the way chimps walk single file through the jungle that was it monkeys plus war equals cool the initial idea was for the chimps to fight the nazis during wwii but the more i thought about the story the more it made sense to have it take place in vietnam its a lot easier to explain the use of trained chimps in a war that takes place in the jungle
4217539 a lot of people assume that the play on words was the initial inspiration but i didnt think of the name until the whole thing was plotted
4217540 i was deathly afraid that someone else was going to come up with the same idea before i had a chance to make it myself luckily that hasnt happened that i know of
4217541 and for years id thought about taking advantage of the opportunity
4217542 at the top of my list was image mainly because i knew that they only print creator owned material but i had also noticed that in the past few years theyd begun to print a much wider variety of genres and styles so i checked out the submission guidelines on their website and i sent them a copy of the first issue about a month later they e mailed me and they said they were in
4217543 i went to an arts high school in san francisco
4217544 and then i attended the cooper union in new york after college i randomly came in contact with larry fessenden a new york based director he was looking for someone to draw a comic based on his upcoming movie wendigo over the next eight years i worked at his production company glass eye pix as a freelance illustrator i did everything from animatics and storyboards to pre production design
4217545 whenever i could i urged him to make more comics and over the years we produced a wendigo comic an anti bush comic named what are you voting for and most recently an adaptation of his newest movie the last winter which was printed by image comics
4217546 in terms of comics creators i love the mood and design of mike mignola i love the action and clarity of katsuhiro otomo and i love the characterization and simplicity of jaime hernandez
4217547 recently ive become much more attracted to the simplicity of black and white art i think you can learn more from black and white art because you get a much better feel for what the originals look like theres no flashy color to hide behind what you see is what you get i really think that getting an image to read in just black and white is no easy task and i love to look at artists who really know how to do it
4217548 the guys who gave the world the teenage mutant ninja turtles so i think its somewhat fitting that the first book i put out into the comic book universe is also a story about ass kicking anthropomorphic animals
4217549 i guess im just making a comic that i would like to read
4217550 i grew up reading mostly superhero books but in high school and college i moved into the more independent stuff and as more foreign comics have been made available ive gotten into the wider world of sequential art
4217551 i guess what im saying is that i take comics seriously as a medium and id like to think that people who feel the same way will like what im doing its definitely a war comic there are lots of guns and lots of cursing but its also a very fun and adventurous genre piece ill tell you what i told image when i pitched it to them people love to see monkeys dressed up like humans especially when theyre smoking cigarettes and guerillas has that in spades
4217552 i have come up with ideas for two sequels to guerillas but they were conceived more as jokes than anything else
4217553 the truth is ive got plenty of other ideas that i want to do so as long as people will keep reading my stuff id like to keep trying new and original ideas
4217554 the pentagon emphasized that its initial concern would be providing relief supplies but announced wednesday that it would also begin efforts to rebuild the georgian military
4217555 our focus right now is on delivering humanitarian aid and taking care of the immediate needs of those who are caught in this conflict said pentagon spokesman geoff morrell when the dust settles i am sure that we will help this sovereign nation and ally rebuild its military
4217556 since 1997 the u s military has spent approximately 277 million in military aid to georgia on uniforms ammunition communications equipment and vehicles
4217557 a senior military officer involved in planning the mission said the new military assistance under consideration for georgia could include more joint exercises stepped up military training closer ties to the georgian military command and sales of equipment to replace vehicles and weapons destroyed in the five days of fighting before the cease fire agreement
4217558 the official acknowledged that there were risks to sending additional u
4217559 its never zero risk but i think it will be ok said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the mission
4217560 the mission the president has given us at this point is humanitarian
4217561 i dont see any prospect of the use of military force by the united states on this mission
4217562 sending us forces into georgia albeit to deliver humanitarian supplies represents the most serious military escalation between washington and moscow since the end of the cold war
4217563 so what prompted mr bush to come out with such a tough response against his erstwhile ally after six days of dithering one clue could be the sabre rattling by dick cheney the vice president who said at the weekend that the kremlins move would not go unanswered mr cheney may have persuaded mr bush that a more robust response was needed the white house may have felt the need to reimpose its authority after the tough stand taken by john mccain the republican nominee for the presidency who has used the crisis to demonstrate his leadership on national security matters
4217564 i hope that this match will be for us very important
4217565 i hope from baku they will travel directly to wales and everything will be ok
4217566 most of the georgian players are playing in europe so they will arrive from their clubs
4217567 we have no immediate plans other than to continue to upgrade our football situation
4217568 i think there are a lot of different scenarios and division i a would be one of them
4217569 there are a lot of things that go into those kinds of decisions
4217570 we would certainly need the support of the fan base and the boosters people have to think its a great idea
4217571 we have no immediate plans other than to continue to upgrade our football situation
4217572 i think there are a lot of different scenarios and division i a would be one of them
4217573 there are a lot of things that go into those kinds of decisions
4217574 we would certainly need the support of the fan base and the boosters people have to think its a great idea
4217575 there are only three other fcs teams in california uc davis sacramento state and san diego and one of them wont play us
4217576 were in a very good conference in the big west in all of our sports
4217577 the conference is great for us it services everybody but it leaves football hanging out there our football program has been extremely strong and we have such a rich history wed like to have a more stable situation for our football program
4217578 a guy in his stature what hes done in this league to be on a new team now it is going to be a media circus for that game
4217579 i dont know how im going to react when i see brett favre in a jets uniform
4217580 i fully expect our sideline to all be standing up
4217581 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4217582 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun will be over very quickly the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4217583 we know who he is and his credibility in the league but its preseason and its not like we game plan
4217584 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4217585 it was an emotional game and a great opportunity for a lot of our players to go up there
4217586 last year there was a little bit of an unknown feeling but this year our players are really excited and understand that virginia tech has a great football team and a great football program but they stood toe to toe with them last year and competed with them i think that gives them an tremendous amount of confidence going into this years game
4217587 i know last year some people thought we didnt have a chance at all and we played them close so this year we should have some confidence when we play them
4217588 last year they were returning eight starters on each side of the ball and they had a great nucleus of players who had experience and had been battle tested
4217589 this year i know theyre going to have talent and still have some great returning players theyre going to throw talent out there on the field they probably just dont have as much experience this time
4217590 last year virginia tech was my first game playing at the d 1 level and it was a great experience
4217591 this year there will be a ton of people there again and it should be an exciting atmosphere playing at the panthers stadium
4217592 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone
4217593 i did learn a lot as a true freshman but we have a totally new offense
4217594 i feel fortunate and i think the marshall football program is fortunate to have that many guys who can play running back
4217595 it doesnt mean anything if i dont live up to it
4217596 with guys like chubb small terrell edwards jo jo cox and the rest of the young guys to push me everyday i think i can be a great attribute to the team
4217597 the running backs understand that every time you touch the ball you have to put your best foot forward
4217598 thats what we expect here at marshall when you touch the ball i should be edging forward in my seat and wanting to stand up and start thunder clapping if you are not going to do that for me i dont want you in the game
4217599 its hard to replace guys like former herd quarterback bernie morris and former herd offensive lineman doug legursky
4217600 but we look forward to getting better so we can win more games
4217601 reach new heights is kind of our slogan this year we have nine new faces in this years program so its a completely different team
4217602 this has been the first real summer weve had a chance to have all of our players here
4217603 last year we got here right at the beginning of the summer and we had just a few guys the summer is a time they have to volunteer on their own we cant coach them its the summer that they can all be together and have a chance to get ready for the fall
4217604 our veteran players have done a very good job in bringing the young guys in
4217605 theyve done a great job making them feel a part and helping them along in the weight room and the court and helping them off the court to their classes thats when you start building great chemistry and togetherness as a team
4217606 he had some bone spurs on his foot but is doing much better now
4217607 chris lutz has been banged up with a back issue and were hoping to get him back hes been out six weeks terrell baines popped a tendon in his left hand which put him out 10 weeks weve just had a couple of guys dealing with some bumps and bruises other than that but when the guys are playing every day and theyre competing at a high level injuries are going to come unfortunately
4217608 hes worked hard and hes led our guys this summer i know hes real excited about trying to put in postseason play at least one year while hes here and hes got a great opportunity to do that to reach the 1 000 point mark is a great honor but i think he would give all his points up for a chance to play in the ncaa tournament
4217609 always your goal is to win and have a chance for postseason play
4217610 if that be the ncaa or the nit we need some tournament experience and its going to be our goal going into the season as the season progresses it will be depending on how the new guys along with the older guys come together our league is very competitive
4217611 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of energy and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4217612 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew it was just a matter of time before we got it done i love being part of this organization and the direction of the team
4217613 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
4217614 fg to gain 2 seats mckenna gain in d central apr 07

4217617 6 7 seats for the pds with cog getting in for 8 on a good day
4217618 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
4217619 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
4217620 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
4217621 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
4217622 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4217623 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
4217624 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
4217625 hopefully they can do that against another team when the season starts
4217626 they get to go a lot of different periods against each other and theres good competition there
4217627 i just try to run at them full speed at all times and give them different looks
4217628 we try to show them different types of looks so theyll be ready on saturdays
4217629 they make you think so much about them running by you but they can run other routes
4217630 by the time you realize it theyre running a slant or a comeback
4217631 1are we beginning to commend ourselves again or do we need like some people letters of recommendation to you or from you 2 you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts known and read by everybody 3 you show that you are a letter from christ the result of our ministry written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts
4217632 and do not go up to my altar on steps lest your nakedness be exposed on it
4217633 but when we see a quarterback we cant do anything about it
4217634 as long as everybodys playing fast were going to do good and thats what we were doing today
4217635 the young guys are really stepping up it was good to see how they would react in certain situations
4217636 i thought malcom williams played well today and overall i was pleased with the receivers
4217637 this is what scrimmages are for to see which players step up and have a good time
4217638 its going to be real efficient and i think its going to be good for us
4217639 you get a little tired but you can really catch defenses off guard
4217640 its good to see how the young guys would react in the stadium to certain situations
4217641 obviously playing the bubble and out on the practice fields is good but theres something about coming into the stadium you can tell who wants it and who doesnt
4217642 it was depressing but everything happens for a reason i just tried to get back on the field as soon as i could
4217643 im trying to get as good as i possibly can
4217644 with practicing watching film everything physically getting better i want to be in the best shape ever
4217645 ross is doing a great job filling in that position
4217646 hes very instinctive and has a knack for making big plays hes going to be a great player
4217647 i cant take that for granted because we have a great linebacking corps
4217648 the competition is always great so ill have to go out there everyday and just compete
4217649 they can propose the rules on controlling the general public but when it comes to the native hawaiians native hawaiians rights are separate and independent
4217650 i have never seen any hawaiians disrespect the palace it is a place of great respect and reverence to me
4217651 but if you look very closely these are to protect the entity it is not against a people or a person its simply to protect the properly liability
4217652 hes very nice and i hope people leave him alone hes a very nice man
4217653 a hot dog one of our famous hot dogs an energy bar and aloha tea a green apple
4217654 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
4217655 where exactly the same genes can produce different heritability depending on the environment
4217656 environment was widely different for everyone much more of the difference would come from experience
4217657 we are not pleased and concerned with the direction fantasy sports have taken
4217658 shes our asian player shes got a fine personality and is truly gorgeous
4217659 she can make a contribution to our countries friendship and by supporting her we can do a little too at the very least if we dont cheer for her that would hurt our friendship
4217660 id feel quite honoured if im able to do that
4217661 lots of chinese friends cheered for me it made me very happy to hear their voices
4217662 how could you use the ebook to cross promote your products or services but yet by giving away to your competitors or businesses that market themselves to the same particular target market so that they could add value to their customers yet you still get a kickback by providing people information about what you do therefore generating leads
4217663 president pervez musharraf is expected to leave office in the next few days before pakistans parliament takes up impeachment proceedings against him following a breakthrough in secret talks designed to ease his departure from office
4217664 now ive put a little chip on my shoulder and ive just got to move on take my situation and turn it into a positive and use it as motivation
4217665 i cant play the first two games thats the reality of it those are facts
4217666 donald is a great kid and i have the utmost confidence he is going to be a great player for us this year
4217667 now all of us need to go day by day but i have a lot of confidence hell be ready to roll
4217668 a lot of schools i dont know how many have done the same thing since we did
4217669 i have great respect for other ways of doing things and people understand we do certain things our way
4217670 but every situation is different you try to make sure you have all the facts and make sure you made the best decision you possibly can
4217671 when they presented it to me the more i thought about it the more i thought it was a good idea to name a successor
4217672 you boys were trying to recruit i probably wont be here the whole five years or four years youre here but heres the guy thats taking my place and its worked good its worked real good in recruiting
4217673 i obviously get tired of answering the same question when are you going to retire when i dont know and i dont know what to say so many times
4217674 id like to retire when i feel as if i cannot make a contribution to penn state
4217675 i think im under the gun weve got to stay on top of things
4217676 the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4217677 this has required surgery and it has been done with success
4217678 the shadow is a very intuitive device one that is expressive and that has a vast vocabulary of interaction thanks to both the personal experience that everyone has with their shadow and the sophisticated shadow puppet traditions that are found in most cultures in our age of surveillance globalisation and urban homogenisation i believe there is the need to re link people to their surroundings
4217679 if this photograph now appears lifelike to you perhaps you should reconsider what it means to be alive here and now

4217682 cutting these programs means yet another hurdle for our artists
4217683 culture is central to our social and economic lives funding cutbacks such as these not only hurt our artists directly but also hurt efforts being made to bring our cultural product to the international marketplace
4217684 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders

4217695 california voters will consider the most comprehensive farm animal rights law in the country a measure that would ban cramped metal cages for egg laying hens metal gestation crates for pregnant sows and veal crates for calves standard industry practices in which the animals are kept so confined that they can barely move

4217699 i call for the territorial integrity in georgia to be respected and for the cease fire to be honored

4217715 we had the knowledge base from the ev1 we knew how to do electrically propelled vehicles
4217716 the ability to put this engine which is an off the shelf unit for all intents and purposes into the car to extend its range two three 400 miles its important
4217717 its probably the easiest way to integrate electric propulsion into peoples daily lives
4217718 were pretty confident with which chemistries work and which dont work

4217721 asr is best known for action sports products but its show floor is representative of the entire industry and apparel and swim lines are increasingly driven by fashion elements
4217722 this september our runway show and the incredibly strong list of swim brands will reinforce fashions growing influence at asr

4217726 asr allows us to connect with a good mix of the retail buyers and fashion editors we look to do business with
4217727 oh pilgrims oh people of makkah from those who are present and those far off i have lost a pouch that contains a thousand dinars so whoever returns the pouch allah will reward them with good save them from the hell fire and his bounty and favors will be acquired on the day of accounting day of judgment
4217728 oh khurasaani our city is in a very tough condition and the days of hajj are few and its season is appointed and the doors of profit making are closed this money might fall in the hands of a believer who is poor and old in age maybe he plans to give it if you make a promise that you will give him a little bit of money that is halal permissible for him to use
4217729 he wants one tenth of the money a hundred dinars
4217730 no i will not grant him the money and instead i will take my case to allah and complain to him on the day we meet him and allah is sufficient for us and the best one to trust in
4217731 i realized that it was the old man is poor and he was the one who took the pouch of dinars and wishes to have a little portion of it
4217732 give us a hundred dinars and he refused and said he would take his case to allah what should i do o lubabah i must return it for i fear my lord and i fear that my sin is multiplied
4217733 o people of makkah o pilgrims who ever of you find a pouch containing a thousand dinars let him return it and they shall surely find great reward with allah
4217734 if you are gifted from the provision of allah without begging or asking then accept it and do not reject it
4217735 this chest expander is perfect for quick at home or office workouts
4217736 you have nothing to be concerned with this tree you better mind your worship and do not give it up for the sake of something that does not concern you
4217737 allah has not made the cutting of this tree obligatory on you you do not lose anything if you do not cut it if its cutting were necessary allah could have got it done through one of his many prophets
4217738 i propose a settlement that will be to your advantage
4217739 you are a poor man a mere burden on this earth if you stay away from this act i will pay you three gold coins everyday you will daily find them lying under your pillow by this money you can fulfil your own needs can oblige your relative help the needy and do so many other virtuous things cutting the tree will be only one virtue which will ultimately be of no use because the people will grow another tree
4217740 at first your anger was purely for earning the pleasure of allah and therefore almighty allah helped you to overpower me but now it has been partly for the sake of the gold coins and therefore you lost

4217778 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
4217779 taj approached the group of teenagers around 10 45 pm and asked whos jewish
4217780 he then slapped her in the face and pullled her hair before her friends jessica motta kayla hungle and daniel ball attempted to intervene
4217781 the canadian arab federation has not only not uttered one word of condemnation for this horrific attack but they have remained silent in the face of arson attacks in canada directed against shuls and jewish community centers and violent attacks on jewish students on local university campuses
4217782 a jewish camp in northern ontario was attacked no one was hurt but property was smashed and tires slashed sending a clear message the camp staff was told by the town that jews were no longer welcome in their stores
4217783 jewish businesses in canada are picketed by groups supported by the caf claiming these businesses support israeli apartheid

4217785 recent sponsorship of an essay contest on the ethnic cleansing of palestine in which it urged high school students to channel the groups own fervid hatred of israel for prizes
4217786 under the guise of islamophobia the caf is promulgating hatred for jews in a fashion similar to that of the nazis during world war ii just as the nazis accused worldwide jewry of maintaining a secret cabal with the intent of dominating and oppressing the poor and downtrodden germans so too is the caf actively working to promote the fallacious and patently ridiculous claim that the jews run the world while muslims represent a powerless minority even though there are 1 4 billion muslims in the world and only 13 5 million jews

4217788 muhammed is the messenger of allah and those who are with him are harsh towards the kuffar and compassionate towards each other
4217789 it is the ideology of the muslim brotherhood that justifies and promotes attacks on jews in canada

4217791 our major concern is the safety of jews in our community and to that end we the jdl are offering security training to the community we will not just train anyone the jdl is not seeking a confrontation with adversarial forces but because of the level of violence and intimidation against the jewish community it is important to teach jews how to defend themselves should a situation arise

4217802 i had a dream that my father killed our family and that gave me the idea of killing him
4217803 it was a hassle being told to study the subjects i liked were ok but i hated the teachers of the subjects i disliked
4217804 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4217805 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4217806 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4217807 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4217808 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4217809 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4217810 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4217811 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4217812 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4217813 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4217814 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4217815 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4217816 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4217817 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4217818 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4217819 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4217820 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4217821 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4217822 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4217823 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4217824 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4217825 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4217826 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4217827 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4217828 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4217829 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4217830 the right information has to be given to the people
4217831 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4217832 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4217833 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4217834 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4217835 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4217836 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4217837 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4217838 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers lin declined to answer when asked if peiyi should be included in the closing ceremony except to say that he was not the director he said his daughter was not doing any rehearsals and that he presumed she would not be involved in the closing ceremony

4217998 madness this is ancient greece but i get the feeling that the ccc is not really repeating the hackneyed hand waving of those who feel that the growing pressure on digital liberty is nothing to worry about you could say that they are being ironic even but theres more to it after all it has been a successful year for us the digital natives and infonauts the german constitutional court not only die datenschleuder the ccc is visible in all the debates clearly this is nothing to be shy about with all these successful campaigns the ccc has the right to show off their success is nothing to hide but this goes beyond political activism other members of our merry band of deviants have nothing to hide too after all nerdy pastimes like obsessive coding or tinkering with microcontrollers are cool now its time to get out of our closets and show our soldering scars with pride

4218206 d r finns en praxis som vi drev f r n gra r sedan namnet ska inte vara vilseledande
4218207 esto no es un tema de inseguridad no se trat ni de un robo ni de un secuestro com n sino de un ajuste de cuentas estamos ante un crimen mafioso muy preocupante donde se vio mucha maldad y sa a en los asesinos
4218208 y si fueramos prisioneros cautivos inconscientes de nuestra condici n de presos
4218209 los mercados han comenzado a preguntarse si el pa s podr a estar al borde de otro default pocos participantes del mercado si es que alguno han olvidado los costos y el drama asociados al default anterior como resultado los mercados est n altamente sensibilizados
4218210 la argentina parece deslizarse r pidamente hacia una posici n desfavorable con costos prohibitivos de financiamiento en momentos en que el fondeo es cada vez m s escaso sin embargo estimamos toda reestructuraci n potencial de la deuda improbable hasta 2010
4218211 las preocupaciones sobre una reestructuraci n de la deuda en el corto plazo parecen exageradas
4218212 mirando hacia adelante la pregunta es ser capaz el gobierno de continuar explotando sus ahorros en 2010 los mercados parecen ser cada vez m s de la opini n de que no
4218213 no vemos la recompra de bonos como un indicio de un cambio fundamental en la pol tica econ mica
4218214 la inflaci n el robusto crecimiento y los altos precios de las commodities
4218215 impacto negativo del retroceso reciente en los precios de las commodities agr colas en las cuentas fiscales y en el desempe o de la econom a real
4218216 es bastante parad jico que un pa s con super vits fiscales gemelos que a n crece a tasas s lidas y cuyas principales exportaciones han tenido un aumento significativo de los precios desde 2003 a n carece de un acceso directo a los mercados y tiene que pagar un 15 para colocar deuda
4218217 ya no es una cuesti n de si los kirchner ser n derrocados sino de cu ndo lo ser n
4218218 dada la intransigencia de los kirchner s lo es una cuesti n de tiempo para que sean echados
4218219 desafortunadamente los cambios abruptos de poder en la argentina tienden a ser ca ticos esa es la raz n por la cual los mercados anticipan un default aun cuando los indicadores macroecon micos del pa s son consistentes
4218220 esta es una pel cula que ya conocimos bien es muy dif cil que un gobierno que pierde la confianza de la sociedad pueda recuperarla
4218221 la situaci n es bastante mala y dado el camino que transitan los kirchner esto terminar mal ya que desde sus tiempos en santa cruz ellos no cambian de rumbo cuando eso puede ser visto como una se al de debilidad
4218222 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
4218223 mediante carta dirigida al coordinador residente del sistema de naciones unidas enrique ganuza y acompa ada con copia a diversas autoridades el observatorio ciudadano manifest su extra eza ante un acuerdo celebrado sin la debida consulta a los pueblos ind genas as como su preocupaci n por las implicancias que ste pueda tener en los derechos de estos pueblos en chile
4218224 a ser consultados mediante procedimientos apropiados y en particular a trav s de sus instituciones representativas cada vez que se prevean medidas legislativas o administrativas susceptibles de afectarles directamente
4218225 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4218226 emplazamos p blicamente a ambos consejeros a que si tienen algo que decir comentar o discutir las puertas de la comunidad siempre han estado abiertas al di logo y por lo tanto les invitamos p blicamente a visitarnos adem s necesitamos que cambien su actitud servil a los intereses del estado chileno y que le hacen un flaco favor a la lucha de nuestro pueblo mapuche
4218227 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4218228 el objetivo de la cumbre de mujeres es encontrarnos para intercambiar los an lisis de las realidades de nuestros pa ses y a partir de ah hacer incidencia en todos los espacios y tambi n trabajar para que las mujeres ejerzan sus derechos con la m s amplia participaci n

4218232 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
4218233 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
4218234 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4218235 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4218236 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4218237 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4218238 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4218239 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
4218240 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4218241 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4218242 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4218243 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4218246 todav a no se ha hecho la devoluci n pedida de las cintas y del respeto al derecho del secreto de las fuentes eso independiente que la ley no lo consigne porque esto no significa que no sea leg timo se ha pedido al ministerio de interior por medio de su subsecretario felipe harboe y a trav s de la ministra de cultura paulina urrutia pero la verdad estamos a la espera de una conferencia de prensa del ministerio de cultura la que todav a no se da
4218247 ha sido la mayor preocupaci n de elena varela y de los organismos de derechos humanos en la medida que da cuenta de la situaci n y violaci n de derechos del pueblo mapuche ella ha filmado a alguno de esos pueblos incluso nosotros la hemos acompa ado
4218248 es imprescindible un pronunciamiento formal y p blico de parte del gobierno de chile que incluya la defensa integral del trabajo period stico y documental
4218249 the funding choices made were inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases or the money was going to fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
4218250 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
4218251 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
4218252 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding
4218253 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4218254 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4218255 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
4218256 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4218257 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4218258 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo

4218263 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4218264 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4218265 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4218266 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4218267 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4218268 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4218269 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4218270 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4218271 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4218272 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4218273 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4218274 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
4218275 listen i was an ordinary fella you know but in those days you only paid two dollars for the whorehouses but first of all wed go get a bowl of chinese you know shrimp shrimp and fried rice that was my favorite

4218278 im amazed at how much we achieved many feminist ideas such as the right to maternity leave have become mainstream but im also horrified by the casual misogyny of 21st century life
4218279 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
4218280 where is the buddhist rielle she was a very grounded spiritual beautiful person
4218281 it was a different generation than my own today it would come under the rubric of valley girl talk the use of like instead of to say they were open speaking about sex
4218282 rielle is the black sheep of the family we were all raised the same way she chose a different path
4218283 to clear the space of bad spirits and bring in the good ones but it was meaningful and earnest
4218284 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4218295 my officers wont even use the restroom they prefer to go home instead of use the facilities here
4218296 we dont need to maintain this large facility to operate the business of the city
4218297 this is like stepping into the unknown when we start to repair it we have no idea what well discover and what that cost will be
4218298 ive got two officers that the mold does bother they come in get their assignment and they wont come back in the building ever hardly unless they have to
4218299 because the epulse is lightweight and does not have a chest strap it is an ideal choice for men and women wanting to comfortably and conveniently monitor their heart rate or calories burned

4218345 right now were in discussions with the potential for lottery tickets for the state lottery maybe being sold at the airport which is done in a number of states
4218346 that extra revenue could go to hire a few more city employees and benefit the state and all the beneficiaries of the lottery system that will receive more revenue as a result of more ticket sales
4218347 we are moving forward with the capital projects that dont require additional hiring such as roads or expansion of a police station if the officers are already there
4218348 but we are looking carefully to make sure that any new facilities we build will have the revenue to staff them
4218349 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4218350 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4218351 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4218352 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4218353 the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4218354 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4218355 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4218356 the air activities in and around that region have slowed dramatically over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
4218357 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4218358 our early comments were make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us so thats the assessment thats going on during this 48 hours
4218359 were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively that went far beyond just re asserting the autonomy of abkhazia and or their view of the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia but to punish georgia
4218360 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4218361 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4218362 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4218363 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4218364 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4218365 the provisional cease fire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4218366 kids are getting these drugs from their homes or from their friends homes but there is a tremendous disconnect or denial among parents about this
4218367 democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul
4218368 members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel have gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4218369 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4218370 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4218371 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation

4218379 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4218380 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4218381 the secretary general is extremely concerned by the impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to civilian property and infrastructure as well as sizeable displacement
4218382 the critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4218383 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4218384 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4218385 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4218392 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4218393 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4218394 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4218395 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4218396 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4218397 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4218426 investors in wind power have plenty of reasons to be upbeat
4218427 to gain exposure to the strong fundamentals of the wind industry

4218436 vermont energy partnership is a questionable organization with facts that dont check out all this is a lightly veiled attempt to downplay renewable energy solutions and support vermont yankee
4218437 while wind power is a popular and growing source of electricity generation in the united states it continues to face regulatory obstacles and local opposition and while there is clear potential for an expansion of wind in the state of vermont even fully developed wind can only meet a fraction of the states electricity needs

4218452 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4218453 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4218454 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4218455 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent
4218456 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation as weekly earnings adjusted for inflation lies below the level they reached in august 1998

4218464 it was a long negotiation and a great deal for both will and the saints
4218465 they tell me the surgery went well but thats all i know right now
4218466 hes a great guy to take the time to help a younger guy but im going to have to pick it up on my own now
4218467 we wish him a great recovery and weve got to move on its the whole defensive lines responsibility to help in those situations that hollis has left open from his injury but i dont feel any pressure personally
4218468 that is a big void to full hollis is one of those guys who really prides himself on protecting the linebackers and keeping the double teams off the linebackers so thats the kind of guy you love to have in front of you
4218469 with the new guy obviously hes got a whole different level of athleticism thats going to help him get a lot more involved in rushing the passer and making plays on the ball
4218470 we have high expectations for him but once you get into games and see how he performs the jurys still out

4218480 no doubt this is going to delay things we have tounderstand where the inflow is coming from and then once weunderstand that were going to have to develop a plan to dealwith it
4218481 look what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know its as old as you know as greek drama you know there is a catharsis
4218482 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
4218483 obamas roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4218484 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4218485 he will continue as our full partner in control of ua he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment

4218489 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4218490 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4218491 we did not have abou diaby cesc fabregas tomas rosicky samir nasri kolo toure eduardo da silva and philippe senderos while alex song is at the olympics
4218492 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4218493 it isnt that type of occasion i keep saying that i want us to be recognized for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4218494 im not into the theory of us just going an enjoying the day
4218495 the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4218496 the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4218497 we believe the disappointment in the quarter centers onthe expectation of significant earnings accretion from theholsum and butterkrust bakery acquisitions
4218498 i do not love nuclear or any other source of energy butfor me it is important that emissions are as low as possible

4218509 we are very excited about the results of the first quarter which are consistent with our plans we started shipping our new videoscopes during the last month of q1 09 these sales had a limited contribution to the overall revenues of the quarter
4218510 why should it you cant change something in a matter of a few weeks
4218511 were importing way too much oil whether its 120 or 150 a barrel it doesnt make any difference
4218512 all of those things help and its good for the country for them to happen but you still have to do something about your oil imports which are still almost 70 percent
4218513 in the past thats what happened when the price went down all the plans stopped
4218514 barack obama doesnt have any plan yet that would reduce the imports

4218522 one of the most popular movies right now is sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 which is being marketed directly to teenage girls its been out about a week and has already grossed almost 25 million dollars whats it about white girls having sex with non whites which is white genocide
4218523 if youre anywhere near alabama and you want the chance to meet a real hero mark august 26th on your calendar thats the day david irving a survivor of the jewish holocaust against free speech will be speaking at the prattville holiday inn
4218524 jailed by an austrian court after pleading guilty to denying that the holocaust took place
4218525 for blacks in the americas slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to them unfortunately its the worst thing that ever happened to white americans
4218526 make sense once you understand that jews are the ones who are always speaking in code when they use words like racists bigots anti semites they simply mean white people
4218527 if the wnba womens national basketball association is so hell bent on diversity why dont they hire a couple of heterosexual players or coaches

4218536 and they all think im stupid i can see it in their eyes but i know whats inside their hearts i penetrate their lies sometimes it gets me crazy but i keep my feelings hid cuz i know deep inside theyre only frightened little kids
4218537 its becoming almost like an arms race as to who can ban more things
4218538 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4218539 i dont think any team in any sport is unbeatable
4218540 we felt that the greek team can beat us and thats the way we approach every game
4218541 dont confuse this game as being not a tight game
4218542 today was difficult i think the next game we play will be different maybe after five six nights you can see something different
4218543 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together
4218544 the web site will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies
4218545 more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children
4218546 we were extremely pleased with the bidder turn out as well as the prices realized for this years auction which exceeded expectations to be up 20 from last years sale and set world records for major sporting artists in this economic climate is a testament to our firms position in the market place we had solid participation from private collectors dealers museums and international clients as well
4218547 the more you talk about it the more you hype yourself the more you forget that you have to prove it on the field people in the media tag us as the it team and people start reading into that once they read into it they forget about going out and actually playing the game
4218548 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4218549 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4218550 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4218551 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4218552 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4218553 we have a lot of work to do he said
4218554 we had a really staggered preparation after the european championship
4218555 there is little coordination between different sections of the team klinsmann said
4218556 he has to get the team to play successful good football as we are used to bayern chairman franz beckenbauer said
4218557 the club has done everything to make his job comfortable juergen has turned many things upside down now we need the results otherwise the changes and the investment are useless
4218558 theres no doubt about it it takes a lot of green to be green
4218559 the more renewable energy that were using the better off were all going to be
4218560 i know that the incentives are whats going to make it possible
4218561 throwing more subsidies at solar power will mainly serve to increase revenues for producers because they can charge a higher price
4218562 christian bale attended a london police station today july 23 on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that had been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4218563 mr bale who denies the allegation cooperated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police at this time there will be no further comment by mr bale
4218564 the issue is on gunns side as well as the governments side it is a mammoth task to get the thing completed
4218565 i believe we underestimated the time it would take and what we had to do to satisfy the departments on the process
4218566 gunns pulp mill and climate change tasmanian issues global responsibilities
4218567 in terms of air quality particularly in a place like sydney with the harbour right in the middle of the city youd find a significant enhancement
4218568 i hate to be fair to the obama campaign but it is remarkable that we have two presidential candidates who are proposing mandatory plans to reduce americas carbon emissions
4218569 the lesson from the european experience is that you dont want to give away permits you should move immediately to a marketdetermined price for carbon
4218570 you should aim for as much predictability and reliability as possible in terms of the number of permits and you should ensure the carbon caps are as comprehensive as possible mccain meets none of these criteria
4218571 setting up a cap and trade system is a strong priority for senator mccain that he is committed to pursuing early into his first term
4218572 he has been committed for many years to achieving this goal
4218573 we are completely opposed to setting up a us system of cap and trade until you have a treaty that includes china and india
4218574 banks repossessed almost three times as many u s homes in july as a year earlier and the number of properties at risk of foreclosure jumped 55 percent as falling prices made it harder to sell or refinance
4218575 nationwide the median existing single family home price plunged 7 6 to 206 500 in the second quarter down from 223 500 in the same period of 2007 the median price represents the point at which half of all homes sold for more and half sold for less
4218576 we can confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4218577 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4218578 he will continue as our full partner in control of ua he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
4218579 i was told by my adoptive parents i joined them as a family member as an infant and my biological dad was different and not like the rest of us
4218580 those remarks often caused me to fantasize and wonder about just me who my birth dad really was a monster a member of the traveling circus
4218581 hes got a different talent but same drive and passion and certainly the same sense of humor
4218582 obviously if i knew he was going to be this successful i would have kept him
4218583 ive got two families to cheer me on to help me achieve my musical dream
4218584 should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4218585 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such case
4218586 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4218587 minority americans have been flocking to the nations swing counties hotly contested areas that could play a crucial role in this years election thats got to be good news for barack obama bidding to become the first black president blacks and hispanics are moving to counties that already were racially diverse such as osceola in central florida and mecklenberg in north carolina home to charlotte they also are moving to key counties that remain predominantly white such as lake in northeast ohio lehigh in eastern pennsylvania and oakland outside detroit
4218588 the opportunity to work together with a world class widely known consumer goods organization like the hershey company is a tremendous honor the fact that our solution skyway builder and our team of solution architects helps them maximize productivity is very exciting to us
4218589 under our constitution anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious fraudulent practice but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority
4218590 i cant comment on any investigation and whether ones going on or not
4218591 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4218592 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4218593 i said to four men who came into my house take what you want and they said we dont have to ask you it is ours
4218594 when the russian army goes the ossetians come and take everything
4218595 we are poor now nobody thinks about us they play big politics but nobody cares about ordinary people
4218596 se or ayudame mi mama esta recien operada y yo no se que mas hacer
4218597 i have always considered it an honor for my family to live in what is essentially a museum
4218598 the house is full of history and memories and it is a maine treasure people should take the time to see the blaine house in person if they can particularly during this landmark celebration
4218599 creo que lo mejor entonces es que no los compres vamos a otra tienda a buscar zapatos del mismo estilo
4218600 deja aquello que te gusta pero que te lastima a cambio de darte algo que traer vida plena en todo momento
4218601 i dont know what youre attempting to do with this i dont know why you are doing this this is ill advised and i regret i am sitting here watching you do this ms president
4218602 you and commissioner humphryes have done such a masterful job convincing people that bankruptcy is the way to go i believe bankruptcy will win overwhelming
4218603 it lets the commissioners know exactly how the public feels on the ballot it makes it official so its not just conjecture not just barbershop talk or talk around the street
4218604 i am going to be heavily influenced by the will of the majority of the people of the county i am very sincere about putting this out there for them so it will certainly weight any decisions i have to make if i am asking for it then i should be prepared to receive it and make it a part of my final decision
4218605 if we were going to do this we should have done this two months ago we cant just sit back and wait until november to get a vote and then decide what we are going to do
4218606 we are elected to make decisions we are elected to do the business of the county and its not right to pass the buck when you dont want to make a hard decision to put it up for a vote and say the people have spoken
4218607 has turned fort worth into a boom town like silver city nev in its heyday
4218608 those plants cant handle a multi million gallon slug of salty water
4218609 the state maintains its on top of the natural gas rush and holds up the recent citations as proof but to us this looks like a slap on the wrist
4218610 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
4218611 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4218612 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
4218613 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
4218614 this will help ensure that our children are safe from dangerous chemicals

4218678 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
4218679 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region

4218838 com o aparecimento dos partidos populistas o sufr gio transformou se numa ferramenta para adormecer e escravizar o povo venezuelano em nome da democracia durante d cadas os partidos populistas basearam o seu discurso em in meras promessas paternalistas com a inten o de amolecer a consci ncia popular as mentiras pol ticas alienadoras descreviam a chegada terra prometida atrav s dum mar de rosas a nica coisa que os venezuelanos tinham que fazer era irem s urnas eleitorais e aguardar que tudo fosse resolvido sem o m nimo esfor o popular assim o acto do voto foi transformado no come o e no fim da democracia

4218864 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group
4218865 however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
4218866 this barmy window weve got forces you to either put the club at risk financially or put it at risk football wise if youre not one of the big four clubs
4218867 we try to do our best in every aspect without putting the club at risk we havent got the resources of some of the huge premier league clubs
4218868 this window is crazy the sooner they get rid of it the better
4218869 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4218870 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4218871 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4218872 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4218873 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4218874 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4218875 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4218876 the very type of abuses that created the mortgage lending crisis
4218877 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
4218878 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
4218879 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition
4218880 the gaea universe offers a realism and depth beyond the usual gaming conventions
4218881 gaea explores harsh consequences in our future from dwindling natural resources to the all too human talent for war and how those aggressive instincts can impact our first forays in space colonization
4218882 the vivid writing and compelling characters help us set this game in a believable universe and provides a strong sci fi plot for the players immersion
4218883 el problema es que los prefectos opositores de los departamentos no quieren un pacto fiscal y no quiere que los alcaldes participen
4218884 siento que s lo quieren plata los prefectos opositores y no tocar otros asuntos sin interpretar lo que piensa el pueblo boliviano
4218885 entonces cu l es la raz n por la que el gobierno no acepte restituir el idh el ejecutivo est recortado en exceso a los departamento los recursos del idh con esa acci n entendemos que el gobierno quiere ahogar a las prefecturas en la ejecuci n de sus proyectos
4218886 las cifras que maneja el prefecto coss o son absolutamente falsas y carecen de cualquier fundamento t cnico econ mico y financiero
4218887 el saldo que tenemos hasta este momento de las cuentas de las dos afp que administran los fondos de la renta dignidad es de 126 7 millones de bolivianos es decir algo menos de 17 18 millones de d lares que quiere decir que no tenemos todav a en lo que va de este mes ni siquiera los 21 millones de d lares que se requieren para pagar el siguiente mes

4218903 weve done raids on his house where people were calling in and saying he was staying but weve been unable to find him
4218904 after months of hard work in the studio we finally have the master version of our new album entitled dystopia
4218905 we are all very stoked by the new album as we feel that this is the best release weve ever done and were impatient to share our songs with our fans you can now pre order dystopia from prosthetic records
4218906 were now ready to hit back the road starting with canadian summer slaughter

4218911 to me boxing is like a ballet except theres no music no choreography and the dancers hit each other
4218912 ill never forget when they read the scores and i was announced as the new world champion
4218913 now its time to make my first title defense where the big boys fight on showtime championship boxing
4218914 im here to prove that my fight against witter was just the beginning i have plenty of exciting fights left and i intend to successfully defend my title against cherry ive worked extremely hard to become a world champion and i have to admit i enjoy the view from up here
4218915 i relish challenges and will never back down from a championship fight
4218916 i was considered a big lightweight so moving up five pounds wont be as a big a deal for me as it would be for others
4218917 i think im in the same position as bradley was when he fought witter in may bradley had nothing to lose and was hungry for a win since it was his first world title fight now its me who has the appetite for a world title the challenger as bradley proved is extremely dangerous in these types of situations
4218918 we are interested in reaching an agreement to calm the nation

4218922 we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justices judgment by handing the bakassi peninsula to cameroon
4218923 i dont think cameroon will be in a hurry to exploit bakassis since the security situation remains a great concern
4218924 our struggle will continue until our demands are met whether it be from the nigerian government or cameroon
4218925 was it really worth all that fuss for some chick nobody has ever heard of maybe he got 10 for the shots if he was lucky
4218926 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4218927 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4218928 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4218929 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4218930 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4218931 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4218932 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4218933 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4218934 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4218935 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4218936 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4218937 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4218938 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4218939 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4218940 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4218941 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4218942 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4218943 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4218945 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4218946 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4218947 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4218948 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4218949 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4218950 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4218951 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4218952 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4218953 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4218954 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4218955 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4218956 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4218957 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4218958 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4218959 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4218960 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4218961 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4218962 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4218963 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4218964 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4218965 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4218966 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4218967 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4218968 the success of u s womens gymnastics can in part be traced back to the 1992 olympics in barcelona thats when the american women coached by bela karolyi won their first gymnastics team medal in a non boycotted olympics the team members were wendy bruce dominque dawes shannon miller kerri strug kim zmeskal and betty okino this great video documents the breakthrough through some never before seen home video check it out i think youll like it the growing bolder media group
4218969 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4218970 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4218971 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4218972 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4218973 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4218974 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4218975 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4218976 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4218977 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4218978 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4218979 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4218980 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4218981 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4218982 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4218983 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4218984 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4218985 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4218986 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4218987 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4218988 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4218998 weve built on those strengths to deliver an even sportier coupe version for 2009
4218999 weve spent a lot of time talking with small car customers and focus enthusiasts
4219000 their overwhelming feedback was that a sportier exterior design could attract even more millennials

4219040 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4219044 after 60 hours of labor im taking it one day at a time
4219045 ive been wearing one of the bags for more than a year
4219046 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4219047 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4219048 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4219049 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4219050 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4219051 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4219052 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4219053 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4219054 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4219055 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this
4219056 just because you can doesnt mean you should and sometimes some things have to go wrong in order to go right
4219057 like the gtx 280 which has dropped in price over the last few weeks the gtx 260 has followed suit whether youre a fan of ati or not the release of the hd 4800 series and their performance to price ratio has forced nvidia to cut margins on the new gtx line up of cards and give us an extremely powerful card for what now resembles a fair price

4219270 we worked on head mounted displays improved tiled displays rendering and streaming software colour calibration techniques collaboration and networking and novel interaction systems
4219271 it was quite a broad research agenda for a strep project
4219272 the architects wanted to be able to review a virtual rendition of a proposed building collaboratively and to test the impact of shadows while the automakers wanted very high quality imaging for surface inspection
4219273 most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available
4219274 i know from past experience that the guys really enjoy it here
4219275 i know having played here for a few years what the city of halifax is all about and it is a great opportunity
4219276 we spend most of the year in boston so being able to get out of the city and spend some time in a training camp with 40 or 50 players is a good thing for a hockey club
4219277 it will certainly keep the focus on what we need to do to prepare for a good start
4219278 we have some pretty good teams that will be playing here like montreal
4219279 that will be our next game so we can qualify that as game 8 of the series
4219280 and then obviously who could ask for a better team to face than the stanley cup champion detroit red wings sept 25
4219281 we will be spending a few days in boston to start our training camp and then we will be heading here with 40 to 50 players
4219282 halifax will not only have the chance to see our main team but also the depth in our organization
4219283 i am sure it will be a success not only for our organization but for the city of halifax and all our fans here in the maritimes
4219284 we have some players such as andrew bodnarchuk and brad marchand who are locals adam mcquaid who is from prince edward island and obviously michael ryder that we just acquired as a free agent
4219285 i am sure that the people here will get an opportunity to see these young athletes in action
4219286 and we plan on having our practices open for the public we want to make sure that we give everyone the opportunity to get a good look at a professional hockey team how things are being done how training camp is basically run
4219287 we really want to make this a good experience not just for our team but for halifax and its fans
4219288 the bruins are a class organization and a great bunch of people and there is no exception with claude julien who is in his second year as head coach of the boston bruins
4219289 they are going to hold a good part of their training camp in halifax including the metro centre and cole harbour place
4219290 it is exciting news for the city of halifax and to our organization here and to all hockey fans
4219291 we are happy that boston has picked halifax to do their training camp
4219292 we have had close ties to boston for a long time especially in sports in hockey and in baseball
4219293 you can remember last fall that we brought the red sox world series trophy to halifax for the first time so we have very close ties
4219294 pienso que ahora debo jugar al hockey y despu s hablar de este tipo de cosas fue una buena oportunidad pero por ahora no es importante para m

4219301 but it does not resolve the dispute indeed we would hope everyone acknowledges that it is impermissible under the constitution for a court to order someone not to repeat publicly available truthful information
4219302 the restraining order even if modified remains an improper prior restraint restricting speech
4219303 the first amendment does not allow people to be silenced because their speech exposes flaws even if those flaws might someday be illegally misused by others to protect our clients rights we had no choice but to ask the court to reconsider the gag order
4219304 the students ultimate goal in the security research was to help the mbta improve its security
4219305 despite colorful marketing rhetoric advertising a presentation of the students work at a security conference the students never intended to provide sufficient information to the public to replicate the attack

4219316 ok boys you know what to do smash the head before they have a chance to crawl away if one gets loose in here its gonna be a nightmare
4219317 you want to make sure that you are following the best practices and while it doesnt necessarily mean there will be a hazard its certainly not a practice that we want to see followed
4219318 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with a disaster to deal with it so shut up
4219319 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money

4219324 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4219325 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4219326 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4219327 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4219328 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4219340 attorney general mukasey has abdicated his responsibility to ensure that the department of justice is dedicated to the impartial administration of justice
4219341 rather than addressing the corruption of the hiring process and the harm that has been done to the department the attorney general offers no substantive response
4219342 it may be as attorney general mukasey says that not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4219343 but it does not follow that every violation of the law is to be met with blank indifference
4219344 the u s department of justice has been seriously undermined by improper partisan activities and policies over the past eight years
4219345 unfortunately attorney general mukaseys disheartening remarks yesterday offer nothing to a nation looking for a return to leadership on principles of justice and fair and equal treatment for all
4219346 when the attorney general was chosen to be the nations top law enforcement officer he pledged to restore integrity to the department of justice
4219347 his comments yesterday reveal through both his tone and the lack of understanding of the need for a serious response that his promise was an empty one
4219348 modern examinations of the properties of bezoars by gustaf arrhenius and andrew a benson of the scripps institution of oceanography have shown that they could when immersed in an arsenic laced solution remove the poison the toxic compounds in arsenic are arsenate and arsenite each is acted upon differently but effectively by bezoar stones arsenate is removed by being exchanged for phosphate in the mineral brushite a crystalline structure found in the stones arsenite is found to bond to sulfur compounds in the protein of degraded hair which is a key component in bezoars

4219351 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
4219352 the idea of providing 8 billion for state of the art healthcare for murderers like charles ng richard allen davis and scott peterson is sheer lunacy
4219353 i think he has to be a part of the team and he cant be floating out there by himself because otherwise everyone would be out there trying to derail him
4219354 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
4219355 the federal courts have clearly indicated for 30 40 years that inmates have not lost the right to receive basic medical care
4219356 so there is a constitutional obligation here this is not something the state has a choice about
4219357 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4219358 we have important legislation that is stalled in the senate by the liberal party we have other legislation that is obstructed in the hosue of commons principally by liberal leader stephane dion we have a committee system that is increasingly in chaos and we have mr dion regularly threatening to force an election so i think you have to make up your mind pretty soon
4219359 what we are saying to stephane dion is make up your mind for once and stick to it either force that election or co operate and allow us to govern stop the delaying and obstruction tactics
4219360 either let the current parliament work and let us get on with our mandate or the voters themselves will decide
4219361 bumblebees are a critical pollinator of a lot of the fruits and vegetables we eat every day
4219362 they are linked to a lot of crops we depend on without the bees we would require manual pollination but it wouldnt take long before wed have to completely take some of the crops out of our diet
4219363 the disease spillover from domesticated bumblebees contributes to the decline of the wild bumblebee population but we are not suggesting it is the only factor at play
4219364 whether one is a predominant factor is too early to say
4219365 you want to make sure that you are following the best practices and while it doesnt necessarily mean there will be a hazard its certainly not a practice that we want to see followed
4219366 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with a disaster to deal with it so shut up

4219369 to hold for the plaintiff on either basis would require pure speculation and conjecture
4219370 the fact that there were employees in the area of the dangerous substance cannot impute knowledge of the substance to the defendant
4219371 because prindes is unable to produce any evidence that would imply the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous substance that caused her fall
4219372 if an ordinarily prudent person given the facts and circumstances memco knew or should have known could have foreseen the risk of danger resulting from such circumstances memco had a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid the genesis of the danger
4219373 winn dixie and its employees should have foreseen the risks of restocking 15 the canned fruit section and undertaken to police the area to ensure that the premises remained in reasonably safe condition either by posting warning signs or policing the restocking process more vigorously
4219374 i thought my dad was dead but turns out hes not
4219375 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4219376 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4219377 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4219378 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4219379 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4219380 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4219381 these initial test results from popa 2 are exciting confirming a new exploration play initially identified on our lands in 2006
4219382 the rio magdalena block is a large block near existing infrastructure with numerous leads and prospects for further testing as our confidence in this new exploration play continues to mature
4219383 no doubt this is going to delay things we have to understand where the inflow is coming from and then once we understand that were going to have to develop a plan to deal with it
4219384 theres not a lot of foreseeable catalysts coming in the short term here

4219398 she rice will be taking a certain number of documents that will make it possible to consolidate the ceasefire
4219399 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr dmitry medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4219400 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this
4219401 the head of state and mrs rice both believed that the six point draft agreement approved by medvedev and saakashvili on august 12 should be signed by the parties without delay in order to consolidate the cessation of hostilities and accelerate the russian forces withdrawal
4219402 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4219403 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4219404 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney

4219408 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4219409 its so clear to me its a diplomatic blackmail and military blackmail
4219410 dit onderzoek een grap zal hoogstwaarschijnlijk het werk van journalisten op het terrein nog gevaarlijker maken

4219412 chelsea kan bevestigen dat het kennis heeft genomen van de beslissing van de klachtenkamer over zijn klacht tegen adrian mutu chelsea is erg gelukkig met deze schadevergoeding van 17 2 miljoen euro het is een belangrijke beslissing voor het voetbal want zo erkent ze de gevolgen die drugs kunnen hebben voor het voetbal en de verantwoordelijkheden die wij hebben op dat vlak
4219413 we verzamelen bewijzen tegen het georgische leger dat burgers heeft aangevallen

4219419 the outstanding sales result for august once again demonstrates the economic value the oil and gas industry has for our province
4219420 these sales are a positive indication that b c s leading environmental policies which include legislation for a cap and trade system and the elimination of routine flaring at oil and gas producing wells has provided a level playing field and certainty to industry
4219421 although we had a slow start to the year we foresee substantially better results over the remainder of the fiscal year
4219422 during the second quarter we commenced depillaring activities in the underground mine which has increased raw coal production we are also seeing better availability of surface mine equipment allowing us to move more material there has certainly been a high demand for our product so we are doing everything we can to increase production

4219441 the issue is on gunns side as well as the governments side it is a mammoth task to get the thing completed
4219442 i believe we underestimated the time it would take and what we had to do to satisfy the departments on the process
4219443 gunns pulp mill and climate change tasmanian issues global responsibilities
4219444 i fear it is a case ofmisuse mishandling by the person concerned we prefer an appeal against the existing order i wont comment any further because the matter issubjudice

4219448 i wanted a gold card because it suits my requirements and offered discounts on groceries etcetera but a few days ago i received a vague mail saying my application had been rejected it looked like a computer generated response

4219450 but if a customer is on the cibil negative credit repayment history list we will clearly communicate
4219451 it exercises due diligence as a credit card is much more riskier it is a free loan for 50 52 days
4219452 we have tied up with 15 20 people dealing in scraps in each of the cities that we are present in
4219453 ever since we have started accepting 15 20 year old cars exchange has gone up from 12 to 20 and it has helped an entry level product like alto to become a replacement model
4219454 when we did a market study we saw a latent potential where people wanted to exchange their old cars but did not know where to go and was not getting good value from scrap dealers as well
4219455 our mou with gmr will enable us to establish modern cargo hubs in hyderabad and delhi which together with our central hub at nagpur will function as distribution model for highly effective consolidation and dispatch to destination in the metros and the interiors
4219456 we will be investing rs 5 000 crore in the first phase till december 2009 to reach 15 000mw capacity besides the board has also approved an investment of similar amount to take the capacity to 20 000mw by 2012
4219457 any change in the parameters requires a complete redesigning of the project and that causes delay sometimes

4219485 its always a challenge to come up with something original and i always want tera to be proud of my work so when prepping a new teravision project i usually look at her for inspiration
4219486 there are so many reasons why tera is such a sexual icon and her amazing breasts are certainly one of them

4219498 this wasnt four guys sitting in a room scratching their heads trying to create songs
4219499 these songs were written and then the whole band turned them into motley crue songs thats what albums like shout at the devil too fast for love and dr feelgood were on later albums we got into jam mode and it was hard to focus it wasnt songs first
4219500 so lets put em all together and put it out in front of tens of thousands of people around the country thats something to be proud of its important for us that rock continues

4219533 we did three to four radio or newspaper or magazine interviews a day five days a week for a whole year

4219553 we didnt expect this result i guess we were wrong

4219558 el retiro de los contenedores diferenciados y el nuevo criterio de facturaci n por tonelada en la recolecci n de basura van de la mano el negocio de las empresas ser que haya m s basura ambas medidas tratan de perpetuar un sistema de enterramiento masivo al atentar contra el sistema de reciclado
4219559 el problema de la basura de la ciudad de buenos aires debe ser encarado acorde a su magnitud el sistema de gesti n global de los residuos debe dise arse bajo las pautas de la ley vigente
4219560 la separaci n del sistema de gesti n integral lleva al fracaso de basura cero ya que establece la prestaci n de un servicio formal el de las empresas que recolectan la basura y cobran por eso y otro a menor escala que a n no est definido de esta forma retiran los contenedores sin establecer un m todo superador para la disposici n inicial ni la recolecci n diferenciada intentando desarticular cualquier intento de gesti n integral de residuos
4219561 el objetivo de basura cero es reducir la cantidad de residuos que se env a a la provincia lo cierto es que hoy lo nico que tenemos es un acuerdo entre la ciudad y la provincia de buenos aires para abrir dos nuevos rellenos sanitarios sin ning n compromiso por parte del gobierno de la ciudad de reducir la basura que env a diariamente
4219562 a cobran a de taxa de matr cula nas universidades p blicas viola o disposto no artigo 206 inciso iv da constitui o federal

4219567 to set the record straight im not upset for me but for all of the girls out there that are struggling with their body image a size 2 is not fat nor will it ever be and being a size 0 doesnt make you beautiful
4219568 the towns it girl journalist sara is the tara palmer thompkinson of harrisburg
4219569 if sara ever runs for political office shell have my vote
4219570 when the harrisburg young professionals were founded it was with people like sara in mind
4219571 kudos to sara bozich of the patriot for providing a bit of buzz about the local posters
4219572 this blog is a well tended garden fed by a clear passion for our city
4219573 youre the voice and embodiment of downtown and harrisburg is lucky to be chronicled by someone with wit and style
4219574 well written and clever something in short supply in this town
4219575 i just want to make plays thats what i went out there to do
4219576 thats what ive been used to doing all my life
4219577 i just want to go out there contribute make plays and have fun
4219578 i have experience doing it playing a couple of years playing receiver in cincinnati so it wasnt a big transition for me
4219579 i was kind of expecting something like this to happen eventually
4219580 i just wanted to get on the field and thats what i did and was blessed to make plays out there
4219581 you cant be selfish in here everyone has to play for the same goal if they need me to help out and go play receiver i will do it
4219582 i want to go out and be one of the leaders on the team and make plays and make things happen
4219583 we were shocked and flattered by it and we thank them for it
4219584 the doctors were looking at me as if i was a dead man
4219585 are not necessarily thinking along the lines of a traditional talk show
4219586 bayangkan probabilitas siswa asal malaysia yang masuk fakultas kedokteran di indonesia mencapai 30 persen waktu di rumah sakit sanglah bali saya kaget kok banyak mahasiswa berwajah india ternyata mereka berasal dari malaysia
4219587 alasan perguruan tinggi negeri menerima mahasiswa asing hanya karena ingin dibilang world class yang saya sedihkan mahasiswa asing ini praktik di rumah sakit pendidikan yang dananya dibiayai oleh pemerintah
4219588 jika mahasiswa asing itu nantinya lulus mereka bisa langsung menjadi dokter di indonesia tanpa adaptasi sedangkan dokter dokter kita bisa jadi kuli ini sangat ironis
4219589 saya dulu kaget saat semua rumah sakit akan dijadikan perseroan terbatas ini berarti nantinya rumah sakit akan komersial dan rakyat tidak dapat berobat murah makanya saya berjuang dan rumah sakit kini berstatus badan layanan umum atau blu yang disubsidi oleh pemerintah
4219590 sekolah klasik selalu mengajarkan bahwa yunani kuno khususnya hippocrates sebagai bapak pengobatan tapi temuan kami menjelaskan bahwa mesir kuno telah mempraktekkan kegiatan farmasi dan kedokteran lebih dahulu ketika kami membandingkan pengobatan kuno dengan protokol dan standar farmasi modern kami menemukan resep resep dalam dokumen kuno tidak hanya sebanding dengan sediaan sediaan farmasi sekarang tapi sejumlah pengobatan yang bermanfaat
4219591 sejumlah bahan bahan kuno ditemukan masih bertahan sampai abad ke 20 dan masih digunakan sampai hari ini bahkan komponen aktif diproduksi secara sintetik sekarang bahan lain seperti akasia masih digunakan sebagai obat batuk sedangkan lidah buaya digunakan untuk menenangkan dan menyembuhkan gangguan kulit
4219592 hal ini membuat kami dapat menentukan asal usul tanaman sehingga menghasilkan tambahan bukti bagi jalur perdagangan pembudidayaan pusat perdagangan atau tempat tempat terapi kerja ini tak memungkinkan untuk keluar dari hubungan dengan analisis kimia yang digunakan oleh kolega saya judith seath seorang spesialis minyak minyak esensial dan resin yang digunakan oleh bangsa mesir kuno
4219593 let a hundred flowers bloom let a hundred schools of thought contend
4219594 the course will take students on a tour of how the industry has progressed over time
4219595 pioneers milestones technology and pop culture moments are all highlighted as you get your feet wet in the adult industry by learning the history of porn
4219596 hey theres a message from you did you say anything important
4219597 saya ingin tinggal di sampdoria seumur hidup saya saya ingin berada di sini hingga umur 34 tahun dan bersama rekan rekan saya akan membawa klub ini ke liga champions dalam waktu dua tahun
4219598 klub ini telah memberikan saya kebahagiaan dan apa yang saya dapat di sini tak dapat saya temukan di belahan dunia lainnya
4219599 goal the coalition is working to support proposals by rep john sarbanes of maryland and sen jack reed of rhode island to include environmental education in the reauthorizations of the no child left behind act the proposals would provide new funding for environmental education particularly to develop rigorous standards train teachers and to develop statewide environmental literacy plans they also propose giving states that develop such environmental literacy plans access to additional funds see executive summary for more details on the legislation key points 1 environmental education is critical now because of the complex environmental challenges confronting the nation and world including human induced climate change air and water pollution and the loss of sensitive habitats 2 we will be passing these complicated problems on to future generations we must give them a solid understanding of these problems and the basic tools to overcome them and make informed choices in their own lives our public schools should be doing a better job of providing this environmental education 3 no child left behind has added new accountability to our schools but its strong focus on high stakes tests has crowded out other subjects beyond math and reading 4 across the country teachers have been forced to cut back on the time they can devote to environmental education in large part because the subjects covered in such instruction are typically not tested 5 teachers have had to give up on field trips and other environmental explorations as schools devote more and more time to subjects that will be tested 6 environmental education must not be considered merely an optional topic understanding the environment is a critical need for our young people 7 the legislators proposals would provide new resources and incentives to states to enhance environmental education they would not add any new tests or requirements on school systems 8 the new funding and incentives to expand environmental education will give states and school systems new tools to improve such offerings 9 the proposals are not an either or proposition environmental education can generally be incorporated into courses already being taught including science or social studies classes 10 the proposals will help establish relevant rigorous standards for environmental related instruction and will help train teachers to use the best methods to teach these topics 11 beyond the critical importance of teaching young people about the planet and its challenges research has shown that environmental education leads to improved student performance students enjoy learning about the environment and become more engaged with their schoolwork

4219602 weve fallen in love with arizona wines and want to share them its just that simple were winos
4219603 wine is often associated with california france and italy but it doesnt require world travel we can think globally and drink locally
4219604 its also fascinating to consider the potential reduction on our ecological footprint just by supporting local businesses imagining the emissions caused by shipping products is certainly a downside to the global marketplace
4219605 we wanted to be sensitive to the current viewer behavior and not put a traditional 22 minutes out there in a sense were letting the story dictate where the breaks are
4219606 were going to let viewers all around the show asking them to help solve clues partner with anna a character played by rosario dawson to help uncover the gemini division
4219607 were working with these cutting edge leaders because we believe our technology is crucial in creating this technology in the first place
4219608 it helps build the relevance of the product and gives people a very compelling reason to upgrade their pc with a better faster chip
4219609 im really pushing ourselves and the brands were working with to reframe the discussion
4219610 whats also important to us are sustainability being able to sustain viewership over time vs just a one hit wonder engagement and then pulling them into other interactive elements weve created
4219611 weve already released a series of blogs which you wont know until episode 30 are actually related to the show instead we have people engaging with them now as if it were just another blog
4219612 it will come to bear that a relatively innocent looking blog youre talking about actually ties directly back to gemini division were creating all these tunnels to send viewers down
4219613 the olympics was one of the goals of the season for me so obviously the quarter finals is not going to do it

4219618 rogers been in two finals of a slam semi finals of a slam to consider that a bad year is just amazing
4219619 you never see him lose his cool never see him break a racket never see him berate an umpire i still have a ton of praise for him i still have a ton of respect for him as a man

4219654 to say you 39 re going to provide affordable coverage to people is not the same as giving them health care

4219744 the province became a leader in north america by implementing the renewable energy standard offer ontarians with power line access can produce and sell clean power to the grid
4219745 for example a dairy farm with 80 milking cows can earn about 50 000 a year extra by making electricity with the manure
4219746 despite the ontario power authoritys recent acknowledgment that the resop was meant for communities it is clear there is not much line capacity left and that increasingly local community power is locked out
4219747 even with a real resource and the perfect program there is almost no line capacity left in most of rural ontario rural ontarians want to participate we need integrated solutions for the sector addressing the full economic and ecological costs
4219748 the time has come for ontarios policy the full range of electricity and power focused agencies and the grid to evolve in a manner that benefits all players rather than pitting community power and the private sector against one another for access to the extremely limited transmission capacity
4219749 first nations and other community power groups as well as private developers and manufacturers are working together to secure ontarios green energy future

4219889 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4219890 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4219891 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4219892 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4219893 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4219894 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4219895 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4219896 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4219897 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4219898 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4219899 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4219937 the success of a film doesnt just depend on the content
4219938 it is important to market a particular film and the marketing is as important as the content this launch sets a new standard for releases
4219939 gone are the days of the six week marketing campaign
4219940 promoting the film and planning its release starts long before the movie goes onto the floor the stakes are increasing as the market becomes even more combative
4219941 after the opening weekend its the capability of the content to carry the film forward
4219942 in such a scenario strategically planning out releases is very important
4219943 singh is kinng was a solo release and they went all out
4219944 is for the coal ministry to decide whether there is surplus coal or not
4219945 we have not taken this decision under the pressure of the sp or anyone the developer reliance has been asking for this permission for the last six months i do not think that this decision goes against the umpp norms if there is any surplus coal it can be used for other projects provided they supply power on a tariff reached through competitive bidding
4219946 this entire thing is unacceptable it will create future problems
4219947 i never said the sp has not put pressure on the government i only said i have not put pressure on the government in this matter
4219948 with corporate groups like anil ambanis reliance supporting the government apart from the sp the government is now obviously returning the favour

4219952 who now covers various developing countries such as indonesia and brazil when it is framing parameters for malnutrition and therefore we felt that this standard can be extended to india as well
4219953 since who standards have a larger reference population it may be a better measure of malnutrition
4219954 and with various associated factors such as income and educational levels rising why should malnutrition not come down
4219955 who standards are generally perceived to be more sensitive which reflect facts by the academic community
4219956 its not always that if india adopts who standards that malnutrition will come down it may rise if stunted growth is taken into account
4219957 the real challenge is to use your own standards make an assessment based on them and then take corrective measures
