8230254 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
8230255 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
8230256 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said

8230262 there will be more bank failures but nothing compared with previous cycles such as the savings and loans days
8230263 what is offered for sale is all deposit liabilities insured and uninsured together with the good assets of the bank usually including the bank building itself and certain performing loans in the bank
8230264 insured depositors can still sleep easily and because of that a lot of bankers can sleep easily too
8230265 indymac failure is expected to reduce the fdics designated reserve ratio for its deposit insurance fund to less than 1 15
8230266 then an industry consisting of hundreds of insolvent firms is surely the last institution about which anyone can mention insurance with a straight face
8230267 reality imposes on human beings the necessity of renunciation of pleasures
8230268 in the new freudian perspective the essence of society is repression of the individual the essence of the individual is repression of the self
8230269 we obtain our theory of the unconscious from the theory of repression
8230270 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
8230271 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
8230272 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
8230273 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike

8230279 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
8230280 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
8230281 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
8230282 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
8230283 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
8230284 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
8230285 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat

8230288 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state

8230293 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
8230294 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
8230295 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
8230296 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
8230297 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
8230298 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

8230302 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
8230303 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
8230304 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
8230305 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
8230306 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
8230307 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
8230308 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
8230309 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
8230310 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
8230311 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
8230312 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
8230313 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
8230314 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

8230360 i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they can say theyre the least bit surprised
8230361 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8230362 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
8230363 he wants to go to an election before canadians see he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy
8230364 we learned with you through the media that the conservatives were impatient for the time to schedule this meeting
8230365 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks
8230366 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls back to the government to create that certainty
8230367 if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide any degree of certainty that well be here until october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009 i think all the signs are clear that theyre all committed to precisely the opposite
8230368 if thats what we have to do thats what we will do
8230369 he is looking for an excuse for an election the prime minister wants this election on his timing not on the opposition parties timing
8230370 except that this is the prime minister who campaigned on a fixed election date the idea being that future governments could not exploit their ability to manipulate the date of the election towards their own favourable timing well thats what the prime minister is now doing
8230371 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8230372 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8230373 the powers of the governor general remain unchanged including the power to dissolve parliament at the governor generals discretion
8230374 we learned with you through the media that the conservatives were impatient for the time to schedule this meeting
8230375 we need an election to provide the prime minister with a number of new mps from which to build a better cabinet the harris retreads in the present cabinet should be shuffled into new less prominent positions
8230376 harper has shown that he only wants to further his political career and the life of his party he forgets a big percentage of canadians did not vote for him and offending those who support other parties at every turn is disrespectful he should be doing his job to the best of his ability for all canadians not just conservative canadians
8230377 if you dont vote you dont have the right to complain
8230378 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8230379 we talked for two hours before we looked at the menu
8230380 he was having a blast and provided the best entertainment of the evening even though he was a bit dangerous with his flailing arms and legs
8230381 we had multiple guests videotape the action so dont be surprised if he shows up on americas funniest home videos one day
8230382 after being kept apart for those few hours where we missed each other so much we were both very emotional when we saw each other for the first time at the altar we wanted to hug and kiss each other hello but had to go through the ceremony before we could do that
8230383 we got quotes from caterers that were about half the price of what we ended up paying
8230384 if it bothers him then he isnt the person i should be marrying
8230385 personally it doesnt bother me but in the context of a place of business you should respect their dress code if they have one
8230386 why would you ever need to go shirtless in public
8230387 i dont like that at all theyre all sweaty and gross looking
8230388 skin has a long association with intimacy or sexuality and for a long time society has thought sexuality belongs in the private sphere
8230389 some people might see a pot belly or the man boobs as they say and say e www they dont want to see it
8230390 on the other hand some people enjoy seeing good examples of our aesthetics
8230391 i just think its too much information it also seems kind of unhygienic
8230392 its ok at the pool or jogging in the park its not ok in a business its not ok at stadiums unless you have your chest painted some color
8230393 you cant really discriminate if youve got someone whos a little overweight if the guys comfortable letting it all hang out more power to him
8230394 people got more careful about the impressions they gave off monitored themselves and the reactions of others as the gaze increasingly focused on behavior and the body all manner of social prescriptions and taboos came to rest on the body
8230395 transgressing these norms sends a message to people which is a kind of a threat
8230396 out on their backyard decks sunning themselves sure in an airplane or anywhere else where strangers must sit near them which includes the stands of athletic stadiums no clothing standards are a matter of context would you trust your lawyer if you showed up to consult him and found him sitting in his office half naked
8230397 today you can see matthew mcconaughey and all these guys running around shirtless
8230398 the refrain i hear is you dont want to be the guy at the beach with the hairy back that people are snickering at
8230399 so much of it is about sex appeal they want to look and feel attractive whether theyre straight or gay and the criteria for that is broadening
8230400 lets put it this way if we go bike riding his shirts off
8230401 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies
8230402 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
8230403 theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
8230404 their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
8230405 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8230406 and as i tuck that little girl in and her little sister into bed at night you see i will think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election

8230411 change in dietary saturated fat was associated positively with mass of larger ldl particles and with peak ldl particle diameter and ldl flotation rate these results suggest therefore that feeding saturated fat is associated with increased mass of larger ldl
8230412 in the present study correlation analyses revealed significant positive relations of change in intake of the long chain saturated fatty acids myristic and palmitic acids with change in plasma concentrations of large ldl particles these findings are consistent with studies showing that of the long chain saturated fatty acids myristic and palmitic are the most hypercholesterolemic
8230413 in summary the present study showed that changes in dietary saturated fat are associated with changes in ldl subclasses in healthy men an increase in saturated fat and in particular myristic acid was associated with increases in larger ldl particles and decreases in smaller ldl particles did you spot this inset it matters ldl particle diameter and peak flotation rate were also positively associated with saturated fat indicating shifts in ldl particle distribution toward larger cholesterol enriched ldl
8230414 although there is a possibility that a subset of large ldl particles may be atherogenic 46 earlier results 37 point to a differential benefit of low saturated fat diets on ldl concentrations in individuals who have an atherogenic lipoprotein profile denoted by a predominance of small ldl particles
8230415 during the high fat diet saturated fat was correlated negatively with mass of smaller ldl particles
8230416 an increase in dietary saturated fat has been associated with the progression of cad independent of ldl cholesterol concentrations 56 and in cross cultural studies higher intakes of dietary saturated fat are associated with higher prevalence rates of cad 57
8230417 the lowest quintile those with the smallest and most dense ldl particles had more than three times the risk of heart attack as the quintile with the largest ldl particles
8230418 it creeps me out that people can represent themselves as whoever they want to be through these online profiles
8230419 everyone represents themselves as what they wish they could be and not what they are

8230466 the work being done at the park and in the softball locker room is designed to provide the team with improved facilities in which to prepare for competition practice and play games

8230471 i think the prime ministers intentions are painfully obvious despite the fact he was the one who introduced the bill that said wed have a fixed election date so stranger and stranger but yes im sure the party is ready and we all have work to do
8230472 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8230473 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality

8230476 we are not planning to increase our black sea naval group although russia has the ability

8230485 i remind people that mccain may be the senator from arizona but hes really not of arizona hes of washington d c
8230486 i think forgetting his price tag it was a good effort to go to town and win first up particularly in a rating 82 race and there were some nice horses in that race
8230487 i like the way he put himself into the race were behind time for the good races but at least were off to a good start
8230488 we had him in last spring and he had a virus so he went out for a spell
8230489 he came back in for a blue diamond and golden slipper preparation but he went shin sore a couple of times
8230490 he was just growing and we said to the boss give him time and thats the great thing about darley they do give them the time and im hoping hes going to pay them back now
8230491 weve just had to be patient with him but hes a lovely horse
8230492 mentally hes a terrific horse he has a great nature and in terms of his race sense hes got a lot of improvement
8230493 but a horse weekend hussler did it last year and im not saying we are in his class but it can be done if they are good enough
8230494 but he kept going shin sore at two and he kept going shin sore at three
8230495 so it was very frustrating but im hoping the owners will get the benefit now

8230523 if you truly believe a pandemic outbreak is likely there is reason to believe foreign governments and the u s will clamp down and control the supply
8230524 other places in the world may have a lot of money but no amount of money will get you vaccines in the case of a pandemic
8230525 we see no reason to invest additional money of our own into the pandemic vaccine when we can wait for a foreign government that needs this vaccine to put money in

8230532 i dont think we can continue with the schizophrenic view that we have today sort of part public company part private company where the leaders of the company do well when things are going well but then the government and the public and the taxpayer has to bail them out when it goes bad
8230533 the fact is that we have to have a clear definition of what the mission of freddie and fannie is and if it is to serve the public than it ought to be owned by the public where the risk and rewards are controlled by the public

8230609 the election office is now up an running out of the city clerks division and were here to answer any questions potential candidates or electors may have
8230610 during the next two years the province will continue to work with local elected officials and first nations to ensure any new information about the potential impact sales may have on water quality and the ability to expand the reservoirs is reviewed
8230611 i would have preferred they said it was over and done with but theyve agreed to back off now we all have a chance to say no
8230612 the way it is today the impact on reservoir lakes is low theres no year round residency and we have to protect those watersheds so there was concern that the government would be reselling the lots and development would take place
8230613 its very good news weve always said that its not just a matter of water quality but also quantity we do need the storage studies and im certainly pleased to see that they are not making any moves until we get more information to them
8230614 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
8230615 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
8230616 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
8230617 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
8230618 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to ontario to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
8230619 when we launched u pass last year ubc o students asked for transit service between vernon and kelowna
8230620 we are pleased the vernon regional transit system is putting the service on the road and were sure that students as well as commuters and shoppers will see the benefits of transit for themselves
8230621 im not the kind of guy who gets stressed out easily but i am starting to get a bit worried about where im going to stay i plan on being in kelowna on september 1 to be ready for school and may have to stay in a motel for a while until i can find something
8230622 there is a real housing crunch in kelowna right now and a lot of our students are dealing with the situation there is currently no space in our residences and housing in kelowna is scarce and expensive
8230623 once the particles are deposited into the lungs they tend to accumulate theyre basically like ultra fine shards of glass that penetrate into the lung tissue and the body tries to attack it but it cant break them down
8230624 i dont want to see them in subdivisions i would like to see them in places where there is going to be a mine which is technically what gravel pits are they would have to comply with all the mining regulations
8230625 what that allows the developer to do is actually comply not with the regional district guidelines for developing land but with the mines act for gravel pits which have far fewer regulations so in effect by getting a mines permit the developer can dive under the rules set by the regional district to protect the environment
8230626 it may mean that we will have to pay more for gravel but at what point do we want to safeguard peoples health
8230627 that wasnt my field i soon found out and because i liked cars so much decided this wasnt a bad profession either there were a bunch of us in salmon arm that liked the automobile business and a local businessman in the city saw what i could do without training and made me an offer that i would come to work for him and he would train me in the business i quickly jumped on the chance to see where it would go and whether i would like this as professional and business i wasnt all that sure i wanted to make the move for my future in this direction but decided to stick it out and it was a good career decision my dad was a heavy duty mechanic so i had that for a background the natural aptitude was there
8230628 i graduated from salmon arm high school and went to work in the shop where my dad worked in the parts department shipping and receiving then i decided to go traveling for a year when i was doing that job in the parts department i was most interested in how the place ran as a business when i came back from my year of travel i decided i was going to take the business program at ouc at that point it didnt matter what business it was going to be i just knew i wanted to get involved in something i had a mentor in salmon arm that helped me to get an inside look at the business world before i was finished school the opportunity to take over the auto body shop where todd worked in kelowna became available we worked out the details of what it would take to buy the shop and six months later we started in september 2003
8230629 we took over rudys body shop and in march 2004 and we renamed the business prestige collision we just didnt have enough room at rudys as you know it was a small operation for things like parking so we started to look the following year we had a couple of deals fall through before we found this space on kirschner road we put our offer in and it was accepted in june 2007
8230630 on part of the project we hired a general contractor because of our lack of expertise in this area even in the family there was no construction experience the contractor built the body shop and we tackled the strip commercial centre
8230631 in our first shop we hired a couple of people that were older than us but they didnt fit into our way of thinking about the future stuck in their ways probably describes it best were stubborn and very precise about the way we want things done with the customer front and centre all the time because we started this new shop we wanted harmony from the get go and hiring the young technicians has been the best thing that we could have done and the work they produce is outstanding it is great to have people on staff that actually care if the customer comes back in the future were trying to create a culture that you will feel when you come into the building where people will see the work that is being done by a crew who will care about the finished product it makes for a good place to work everyone on staff is part of what we are trying to accomplish here the last eight months in the old building were super stressful we were so tight on space and it was difficult for everyone but they saw what our plans were for this new location and they wanted to be a part of the expansion and the future we are four times the size now that we were back then our specialty is collision repair thats what we fix we dont really restore cars or do complete paint jobs our specialty would be making your car look as good or better than before it was in an accident
8230632 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
8230633 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
8230634 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
8230635 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
8230636 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8230637 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8230638 these two giant black holes are only about 24 light years apart and thats more than 100 times closer than any pair found before
8230639 on august 9 a series of storms over the south okanagan resulted in a total rainfall of 48 3 millimeters in a single day that was a record breaking day in of itself
8230640 right now penticton is sitting at a total rainfall amount of 85 4 millimeters and the forecast for the next week is cool and unstable so there is a decent chance the record will be broken
8230641 to win one of these is few and far between you gotta enjoy it as much as you can its so bloody painful i had to work a little harder than i thought i would have to
8230642 it was always my aim to come back here and try to defend my title as soon as the gun went off at the swim i smashed in i held on for dear life on the course there were parts of the marathon that were very ugly but coming back it doesnt matter how you feel because the crowd takes you home its amazing

8230810 we have tivo can we order a cable box with a serial 232 port
8230811 its a serial connection instead of a coaxial connection may i order that now
8230812 im not sure let me finish signing you up and then ill transfer you to tech service
8230813 but i dont want to sign up unless im sure tivo will work with it
8230814 once were finished ill switch you over to tech service
8230815 but its pointless if i cant use it with tivo
8230816 youll have time to cancel a woman who ordered service last week has to wait until mid october so youll have time
8230817 i just ordered a cable installation and i would like to make sure we receive a cable box with a serial 232 port
8230818 its just the standard serial port that comes on older printers and some laptops
8230819 let me put you on hold and check on that
8230820 well i cant find any information on that request for you im going to transfer you to billing and sales they should know
8230821 ready to beat the living hell out of the next person who asks
8230822 you can drop the perky attitude before i come through the phone and choke you
8230823 i ordered cable service we have a tivo it requires a serial 232 port may we get a cable box that has that connection please
8230824 well i have no idea what that is but let me put you on hold dear and ill check for you
8230825 well i have an answer for you and two choices i dont really know if theres a serial port on that cable box but heres what you can do you can either rent a dvr from us at 15 99 a month or you can purchase a cable card for your tivo at 3 99 a month since we have a special with your package that allows you a free dvr for a year i suggest that one
8230826 but we have a tivo already we paid money for it we cant return it we also paid for the service for a year
8230827 well if you get ours you dont have the headache of figuring out how to make tivo work
8230828 stripped the district court of jurisdiction to impose compensatory sanctions requiring mandatory vacatur
8230829 if the instant case was moot before the district courts final judgment on the sanctions order that final order is subject to mandatory vacatur
8230830 designed to enforce its own rules even after that court no longer has jurisdiction over the substance of a case
8230831 to punish a party who has already violated the courts rules
8230832 the parties should be able to bargain away the right to receive compensatory sanctions
8230833 it is clear that the sanctions issue could not have become moot before the settlement therefore the district court had jurisdiction on september 14 to issue the sanctions order and mandatory vacatur does not apply

8231106 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8231107 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8231108 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8231109 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8231110 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8231111 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8231112 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8231113 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8231114 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8231115 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8231116 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8231117 an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons

8231122 we congratulate a fellow greek american alexi giannoulias for being selected as a speaker at the democratic national convention
8231123 his place in the national spotlight is a testament to his rising star in the field of politics it is also uplifting to see the pride he has displayed in his greek heritage and his strong desire to give back to the community

8231142 we are always concerned about any provision that comes out as inadequate that extra 3 does concern us

8231145 for the first time in the report we have looked in some detail at different local authorities
8231146 we are concerned that theres a variation and it doesnt seem fair that children in deprived areas seem to get a worse deal than those in more affluent areas
8231147 i am a childminder who has been doing the job for three years and i am thinking of giving up the paperwork side of it is ridiculous
8231148 we now have to do risk assessments observations planning and we have to now be registered as a food premises because we give snacks or a meal

8231156 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8231157 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8231158 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8231159 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8231160 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8231161 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8231162 it was all secret squirrel stuff with tactical landings and take offs under conditions and circumstances that really stress the human body
8231163 it gives us a chance to observe and experience the physiological and psychological stresses these kinds of operations cause within a combat environment
8231164 i was glad i could get an early morning catfish to avoid the heat of the day
8231165 we took off about 8 a m just as the last of the cool morning air gave way to the rising heat
8231166 in spite of being weighted down with a helmet and body armor the hot air from the rotors blasted against me and nearly knocked my heavy helmet off and i had to sit with one hand holding it on and the other grasping my bag to keep it from soaring out the door
8231167 i had always wanted to see baghdad from a helicopter
8231168 but at the speed we were traveling and with the wind shear and banking maneuvers most things became just a blur
8231169 after flying several more minutes over flat rural countryside the helicopter began to slow down as if looking for something then i saw someone on the ground pop smoke
8231170 we touched down where the yellow smoke marked our improvised landing zone and a group of soldiers quickly brought an injured man who was strapped to a backboard to the aircraft
8231171 i didnt have any medical supplies other than the basic combat first aid kit that all american service members in iraq carry the first thing i did was assess my patient i started with ensuring his airway was open and that he could breathe and i looked for any bleeding i realized it was a young iraqi soldier and the medics had already cut away most his uniform i lifted the blanket covering him and found a white piece of tape with a few words scribbled on it stuck to his left side it read blast which probably meant he had been injured by some sort of improvised explosive device it also read rr32 which meant his respirations were 32 times a minute a sign of possible lung damage or even collapse
8231172 at first he was unconscious and difficult to arouse among other things during the flight i was able to keep his airway open and wake him so that by the time we landed he was opening his eyes moving his arms and trying to talk several minutes later we arrived at the army camp and an ambulance soon came to rush the soldier away
8231173 graciously flew me back across baghdad and dropped me off right next to the small sather ab hospital where i work

8231177 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8231178 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8231179 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8231180 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days its awfully hard to tell them apart
8231181 you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8231182 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8231183 all the iits want formal exemption from implementing quota in appointment of faculty like in the space and atomic energy departments
8231184 since the last 46 years both the above departments have been exempted from quota in the appointment of scientists and we were in the same bracket too till recently
8231185 but since it has been pointed out that the iits are not immune to faculty reservation i personally conveyed to the prime minister today about the problem
8231186 we want the government to formally announce exemption to us for better educational quality at the iits
8231187 the sanctity of the iits needs to be preserved to ensure quality education
8231188 there is no discrimination or groupism within the iits we need to preserve this character
8231189 he assured that he would take up the case in the cabinet and the iit standing committee would also take note of it
8231190 the iits have served our country with great distinction i take note of the point that prof gautam barua has made with regard to the reservation issue i take that with me and will bring it to the notice of my cabinet colleagues
8231191 they may or may not there is three and half months more so there are lots of things to be done
8231192 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8231193 it still has to go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
8231194 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
8231195 given that caligula is a film of historical interest we felt we could pass it uncut
8231196 im proud of the work i did in caligula theres no question about that but theres all the raunchy stuff the blatant modern day porn that bob introduced into the film after wed finished shooting
8231197 that to me was an absolutely outrageous betrayal and quite unprecedented frankly it showed that bob had no class whatsoever
8231198 i have never felt so much pain in my life the dog was attacking him and i was trying to release him and i could not
8231199 it seems a political meal is being cooked on fire behind the scenes as the statement released by the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the us secretary of state shows unprecedented optimism about reaching agreement before the end of this year
8231200 the fact that rice met with both negotiation teams separately then together proves what she said in the press conference about both sides abstaining from negotiating in front of the media all this indicates that the negotiations are serious
8231201 it is regrettable that the israelis leak what they have to media while we palestinians dont that is why you find us frustrated as nothing comes out of the negotiation process
8231202 prime minister stephen harper has said that the massive maple leaf meat recall highlights the need for ottawa to overhaul its meat inspection regime
8231203 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8231204 as you know in the recent budget we put considerably more inspectors and resources into this
8231205 under the old system inspectors had a more hands on role on the plant floor did more of the tests themselves and had more freedom to investigate under the new rules instead of heading to the plant floor to inspect with their own eyes inspectors are sent to the office to confirm that the meat packer has performed the required tests and the results are satisfactory
8231206 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8231207 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8231208 government policy was to hire 200 more inspectors thats what weve done since we achieved power in january 06

8231221 kate asked would i forgive her and of course i understood that completely and i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young to play the part she was only 19 years old at the time i was in a hole i had to get somebody fairly quickly and i knew that scarlett was a great actress and a beauty i didnt know if she was really what i had written but i hired her and became totally captivated by her
8231222 she was not only beautiful but also bright amusing charming and gifted im very happy to work with her whenever there is a part that fits anything she could do i would always call her and hope that she would be available for it just as i did with diane mia farrow too i did many roles with her thought she was a wonderful actress and she never let me down i think that the same will be true with scarlett
8231223 id be hard pressed to find any comparison between myself and any of the three characters i played for woody
8231224 the way he writes such fantastic female roles is the best thing about working with him that is other than just getting to spend every day you know chatting with him and bothering him and poking him and stuff like that
8231225 sure why not got to make sure hes still like awake
8231226 every single interview ive ever done for any of his movies we always get the muse thing its not that way and i dont think it is that way
8231227 i just think im fortunate enough to fit in to the young girl young woman part of his stories just the same as dianne wiest would fit into a certain part
8231228 i think you know that woody and i both appreciate how wonderful it is to work with your friends its just fun we always have a great time when we do it we entertain each other we understand each other and yes we poke each other
8231229 this 20 year old rumer sounded like a perfectly grounded young woman
8231230 besides the joy of working with adam sandlers production company so this is really a big deal
8231231 i feel really grateful to be a part of it
8231232 there was a lot of time when we everyone would be lounging on a couch and id be sitting straight up on a stool
8231233 one time i actually couldnt get up we were all on a blanket and i was a on my back and felt like a turtle our director fred
8231234 i actually had a lot of fun with the brace it kind of became my purse and i wouldnt let the prop guys take it away from me it was quite nice to have something to work with
8231235 i enjoyed being a computer nerd and grew up through some things with braces and glasses and this big curly fro and wasnt necessarily too active with the social crowds
8231236 i definitely understand kind of not exactly fitting in but i think everyone has their own version of feeling out of place one of the great things that we have the ability do here is to show that its all right to have that awkward phase its not about whether youre the popular girl or the nerdy girl its about being confident and comfortable with who you are and where you fit in and accept it
8231237 theyre just both very supportive and i think that support is the most important thing any parent can give a kid
8231238 im probably one of the luckiest girls around i kind of grew up on movie sets but theres also a real shift in your mindset when you go from being sort of an accessory sitting in a trailer and hanging out to actually acting in a front of camera obviously i dont think i would be the same person without it all

8231265 as more medications are approved for market each year and become available to americans the opportunity for potentially dangerous or even deadly errors due to drug mix ups from look alike or sound alike names becomes increasingly high
8231266 while one drug name may be nearly identical to that of another drug the two could be used for completely different conditions this presents a major public health threat and we think this new tool can play an important role in helping to reduce patient risk associated with this problem
8231267 as one can imagine for someone with hypertension receiving the wrong medication could present a potentially severe consequence
8231268 this is exactly the type of mix up we think could be avoided through tools such as our drug error finder this may be useful to parties across the health care system who are involved in dispensing and administering medications and especially to caregivers and to patients who should always remain vigilant and participate actively in their care
8231269 they will support improved management of personnel safety traffic management collision avoidance and the improved efficiency of haul truck operations at mine sites
8231270 they will also help develop workforce management systems to provide increased security for workers in remote areas such as queenslands outback and piemontes alpine regions in italy

8231294 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8231295 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8231296 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8231297 however should such an offer be received then the club would be forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave

8231330 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
8231331 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
8231332 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
8231333 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will

8231362 the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights
8231363 when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive
8231364 heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern
8231365 lewis felt a lot better on sunday but was still slightly sore and tender

8231368 lewis extended his lead in the drivers championship and in the constructors we extended our lead over bmw sauber and closed down the gap to ferrari
8231369 no one ever said that the students couldnt wear their cheer leading outfits for pep assemblies in games
8231370 during academic times they wear academic clothes and during sports times they wear sporting clothes
8231371 im not saying that the cheerleaders and drill team are better than anybody else however if thats not possible i would like something put in the dress code policy where if the coaches deem it ok for the cheerleaders to wear their uniforms to school that is a honor and that is something these girls have earned then i will stand up and say fine do it for the cheerleaders

8231402 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8231403 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8231404 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8231405 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8231406 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8231407 when i first saw simon back in april he had neck pain dizziness and real bad headaches
8231408 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8231409 then i saw a great white throne and him who sat on it from whose face the whole earth and the heaven fled away
8231410 and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books more than one were opened
8231411 the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them no mention here of mormon spirit prison or roman catholic purgatory

8231415 ive always had an interest in the economy and politics and it was the most interesting time
8231416 i realised it wasnt going to be disneyland i saw a couple of other tourists in a backpacker place but basically there was nothing to do for tourists
8231417 i would have considered it zimbabwe due to what i heard about the variety of wildlife here although it would have been a harder decision if the project was not here to help
8231418 i may even come back to zimbabwe given half a chance
8231419 tourism has slowed to a trickle in the last few years
8231420 it is a shame because as well as zimbabwe being the bread basket in that area of africa with agriculture and farming it was also a tourism success story
8231421 it has been a real challenge for us because not always what the media says is what is going on on the ground
8231422 desperate to express what is happening in more upbeat terms
8231423 we have very very under occupied hotels a very low degree of trade of tourist type items those shops are barely functioning
8231424 the wildlife is nowhere near as abundant as it was because of all the poaching and illegal hunting this is all linked to the failing economy
8231425 unemployment is rife so the locals have no money and no food they see the wildlife as meat for the pot
8231426 yes there is political strife and things that are not right in terms of what the government is doing but the country is really something to behold people go on holiday to have an experience and that place has that ability it has the wow factor

8231430 by establishing the emergency preparedness grants program the bcbsnc foundation recognized that responding to disasters is not just about providing relief it also calls for reform of emergency management systems so they perform at optimum levels when the next situation comes thats particularly important for the most vulnerable members of our society who are often hit the hardest
8231431 i applaud the bcbsnc foundations efforts and hope other community groups and funding organizations follow their lead
8231432 north carolina is prone to severe weather and the far reaching effects of hurricane katrina continue to remind us of the fact that we must be prepared
8231433 we hope that this report will be a resource for organizations across the state that aid in responding to the public during a disaster or emergency
8231434 our intent is that the original investment made in the grants program will be multiplied through increased community awareness this report will be an important tool in achieving that goal

8231438 the conversion of the dry cleaning industry to non toxic cleaning methods is an important effort and natural cleaners is at the forefront of the green initiative in these rural colorado neighborhoods
8231439 in addition to the positive environmental aspects of this deal the funding will also help support nearly 30 new and existing jobs
8231440 the use of traditional chemicals in this industry is being scrutinized by concerned regulators therefore it is critical for dry cleaning operations to find alternative cleaning methods
8231441 thanks to advantage capital and the capco program were able to advance our mission of providing convenient pollution free dry cleaning services to environmentally conscious consumers
8231442 i am tremendously proud of the core growth our embryonic company was able to achieve in just one year we continue to provide best in breed service to small and mid sized companies who turn to our business process outsourcing solution to control costs without sacrificing quality as we move past the fourth quarter of 2008 that saw a significant amount of non recurring operating expenses and back into our normal operating mode we are quite confident that we will return to a positive bottom line going forward additionally we fully expect robust growth in our roster of clients as we enter our second year of operation as a public company further our flexibility across a broad spectrum of industries has allowed us to diversify our business and consequentially reduced our exposure to economic slowdowns in the united states and abroad

8231445 this seems to be a trait of the modern game players agents are pro active in trying to broker transfer deals this is how they make their money
8231446 quite clearly anthony gerrards representative has been actively trying to stimulate the interest of other clubs regarding the transfer of the player only last week we turned down an offer from a championship club for him
8231447 however such behind the scenes activity is bound to have an unsettling effect on the player this it seems has led to anthony gerrard handing in a written transfer request
8231448 our policy has always been not to keep players who do not want to play for walsall football club this is the stance in this case
8231449 let me assure supporters that as anthony gerrard is under contract until the end of the 2009 10 season unless a substantial offer is received from a championship or premier league club he will not be sold

8231471 we werent allowed by the americans to reach the destroyed houses to try to rescue those who were buried so certainly many of them bled to death
8231472 earlier up on the roof there was like five women and little girls ok we fucked that area up if we did any collateral damage there will be people here asking your answer for the sake of yourselves and me better be you were fucking shooting at muzzle flashes

8231474 some participated in such killings others treated or investigated civilian casualties after the fact many also heard such stories in detail from members of their unit the soldiers sailors and marines emphasized that not all troops took part in indiscriminate killings many said that these acts were perpetrated by a minority but they nevertheless described such acts as common and said they often go unreported and almost always go unpunished

8231497 he had a physical presence against yeovil and he showed that he gives us great options
8231498 didier had a big impact on the game and we are delighted with the way he is settling in here

8231562 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8231563 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8231564 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8231565 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8231566 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8231567 if weve got unhappy drivers it means weve got happy fans this is a speedway not a slow way

8231584 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8231585 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8231586 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

8231591 our new banking will increase the speed by about 18mph therell be above 200mph in places but the qualifying speed wile about 191mph we have safe walls so we hope no more danger but certainly a lot more entertaining for the fans the turning radius is a little more than any other track although there are pother tracks with bigger banking than atlanta and texas but there will be guys going through those turns going a complete lap without ever lifting their foot off the accelerator on the straight aways therell be getting above 200mph we have the worlds best drivers for our vegas racing weekend
8231592 were tickled to death its turned out more spectacular state of the art and ahead of every other track in the world its the most dazzling makeover anywhere and in time for our 10th anniversary the entire project we hd no idea it would be as nice as it is brutons vision has been totally manifested the fans now get something here unlike anything else in the world the race fan always comes first lets give the fan to get close to the heroes of the sport while they are going about their business the race fan is so close to the stars as they work live and in person a few feet away theyll be able to peer right into see jeff gordon dale earnhardt jr kyle busch going about their business itll take some getting used to by the teams with the fans literally looking over their shoulders while they are tightening the engine parts fans will be able to come into the garage and look down at the cars as a surgeons class would be able to look down at an operation they will be able to see jeff gordon come out and talk to his crew chief about what needs to be done to the race car and watch the race team work on the race car it is going to bring a whole new element to las vegas we will have created the most wonderful sports facility center anywhere and well do it in the greatest city anywhere
8231593 speeds will increase but were actually looking for the increased competition
8231594 when the drivers are happy the fans are unhappy when the drivers are unhappy the fans are having a great time and theyre sure going to have a better time in las vegas from now on
8231595 we have tremendous sight lines at las vegas motor speedway wonderful backdrop mountains on the eastside of lv and off in the distance the las vegas strip you have the fan from small town usa that comes here to watch nascar and returns to the strip to downtown and gets to enjoy all that las vegas has to offer whether it is a show the gaming or the great restaurants that we have it has got to be the number one attraction in all motor sports to come to las vegas for nascar weekend there is no better place no other city to get this
8231596 lance burton in unbelievable he did amazing tricks for us right in front of our eyes i was speechless when he even made murphy disappear right beside me nobodys ever been able to do that

8231620 night view assist debuted on the s class in 2006
8231621 what we like about it is it is infrared based its more active than the heat based versions
8231622 its impossible to drive looking simply at the two dimensional night view display
8231623 and because the screen isnt in your direct field of view its difficult to monitor it while driving
8231624 in order to get to the mass market it has to enhance the driving experience
8231625 it has to make it easier to drive give you valuable information to make driving the vehicle easier or enhance the info tainment value of the driving experience

8231634 i have owned the trademark moneybag logo for over 25 years i have used it on my magazines book imprint record company and a few other areas until i met jason dussault i held off on really going out into the marketplace in the street wear line it has to do with finding a kindred spirit and jason is it he and i share a passion for only doing things in life that mean something as a teenager he was a huge kiss fan and spent a lot of time not only dressing like kiss but also drawing my character all over his fashion books so his teenage dream of meeting me not only became a reality but we hit it off with a great business idea together we intend on creating cutting edge in your face fashions the moneybag line at long last is becoming a reality

8231651 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
8231652 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
8231653 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel

8231655 its a small business so we dont have a marketing budget
8231656 weve never done any ads or promoting because we cant afford it so i guess its kind of guerrilla marketing and its free
8231657 i think that the really important thing about using a blog as a business strategy is that usually you cannot connect the dots directly from blogs to revenue
8231658 make sure that the blog fits in with the existing culture of the company

8231672 alan categorically denies that he has made up any story regarding his upbringing and refutes the claims which have been made
8231673 alan has at no point apologised to producers and his position in the show has never been in jeopardy
8231674 some confusion and doubt has been raised about alans relationship with his biological parents which is unfortunate

8231684 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8231685 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8231686 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8231687 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2

8231721 to be honest when it comes to james bond i would actually say roger moore is my favourite but sean connery is a legend
8231722 it was brilliant to finally get the autograph it was totally worth the wait
8231723 im delighted for the boys all year round we get people from across the world coming here asking if sean connery is staying
8231724 i think he was in his mid 40s he told me he had come all this way only for sean connery
8231725 he even asked staff inside if they could help him donate 100 to the snp
8231726 he was so happy though it was properly signed after all he even showed me it he said it was worth coming all the way from bournemouth for

8231731 people want this game you couldnt ask for better teams this is the best match up this will be the wildest craziest of them all chicago and indianapolis are two teams that belong to the entire country so everybody comes out for them rather than just a local favorite
8231732 we take substantial bets and the numbers are truly fantastic we dont reveal individuals or the size of their bets but those numbers wouldnt surprise me around town we have just 60 props and because everybody thinks they know football the margin of victory becomes the most popular
8231733 the 60s and 70s were an exciting time in the music industry and its a pleasure to record these artists using 21st century technology so their fans can enjoy their classic hits with todays quality
8231734 rock and roll tv4u com is a broadband channel concept that gives the millions of fans of these great artists the chance to enjoy their performances on video after all of these years you can think of this as a baby boomer mtv style channel
8231735 weve enjoyed making music videos of almost 100 top songs so far and were just getting started
8231736 well be making the majority of these videos in las vegas and henderson
8231737 they saw the backstage as being not just about releasing apis but also the engagement with the community

8231762 i remember one time i came here i arrived only two hours prior to my race dead tired from the trip but i still managed to come in second behind allen johnson four time world champion
8231763 this time i arrived in time i am relaxed so i will be much better prepared for the race on friday night it will be a great race

8231774 it is unacceptable that in a nation that is as prosperous as ours that 37 3 million people including 13 3 million children continue to live in poverty this increase indicates that reducing poverty is not a priority for this nation
8231775 for catholic charities usa and our 1 700 local member agencies who serve nearly 8 million in need a year the poverty rate is not just another economic statistic this unacceptable figure represents the millions of families we see each and every day who are struggling just to make ends meet
8231776 substantial decreases in these numbers must occur in order to alleviate the struggles that millions are experiencing
8231777 needing help with food rent clothing and prescriptions are all symptoms of much larger problems facing the poor and vulnerable in america such as low wages and the lack of affordable housing and health care
8231778 reducing poverty in the united states must be a national priority
8231779 let these troubling poverty statistics be a call to action for each of us as a nation we must demand that our current and future leaders give a much higher priority to the needs of the poor in their policymaking decisions
8231780 in this election year candidates for public office especially our presidential candidates must move from rhetoric to action and propose comprehensive plans to address the needs of more than 37 million people living in poverty in the united states over the next decade
8231781 we must no longer ignore the injustice of poverty and the extreme inequality in america

8231787 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8231788 do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8231789 there is only one candidate from the middle class that understands the middle class
8231790 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8231791 if you think the last eight years have been good you need to vote for john mccain
8231792 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8231793 its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8231794 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible

8231796 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
8231797 the biggest problem were facing right now is defining mccain
8231798 my biggest question is who is going to take on mccain
8231799 barack is never going to be a red meat attack dog politician
8231800 the thing that matters most is what the candidate says
8231801 theres a disparity between the reality of john mccain and the way hes perceived
8231802 i think joe biden will go toe to toe with mccain they picked him for that
8231803 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8231804 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process

8231821 there has been a steady drop in attendance over the past few school days but the laurel school district cannot at this time ascertain that the drop was due to the department of homeland security immigration customs enforcement raids at howard industries
8231822 district employees have worked diligently today to make contact with families
8231823 those employees have made contact with many families to determine their needs and will notify the local social service agency if necessary
8231824 if we took these children into custody would depend on whether theyre illegal or legal citizens
8231825 in this particular case we cant speak to any specific instance of children coming into our custody
8231826 it is however the function of dhs to investigate and work with law enforcement to ensure the safety of children
8231827 we found no students at our schools whose parents or guardians work at howard industries
8231828 the federal law prohibits schools from asking for any information regarding a students immigration status
8231829 we are not immigration agents we are here to enroll students in our schools and educate them
8231830 they wanted us to be aware of what was going on
8231831 we worked into the night until we were satisfied that there were no students in our district involved with this
8231832 i dont see where the school would have a role except continuing to educate the child

8231869 on that basis we feel there are too many negatives surrounding the stock at the current time and therefore maintain our sell recommendation

8231911 loneliness and the feeling of being uncared for and unwanted are the greatest poverty
8231912 loneliness and solitude are quite different one is defeat the other victory
8231913 loneliness is being unaware of the one who is with us everywhere
8231914 many christians suffer from loneliness because they are sitting instead of serving
8231915 the soul that has been enriched by communion with god will not be dismayed by isolation but will welcome solitude he will seek not the crowd but the closet and emerging will never walk alone for he has unseen companionship
8231916 the soul that is growing in holiness is the least lonely when it is most alone
8231917 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
8231918 21 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
8231919 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
8231920 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
8231921 1 rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren 2 the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity
8231922 many christians suffer from loneliness because they are sitting instead of serving
8231923 32 behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me
8231924 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
8231925 and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world
8231926 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
8231927 for he himself has said i will never leave you nor forsake
8231928 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee 6 so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
8231929 i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
8231930 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
8231931 no one ever told me that grief felt so like fear
8231932 1 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved
8231933 1 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me 2 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you 3 and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
8231934 33 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
8231935 6 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god 7 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
8231936 1 rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren 2 the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity
8231937 15 rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep
8231938 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8231939 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8231940 forgive me this time i shall never forget it who knows but what i maybe able to do you a turn some of these days
8231941 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
8231942 7 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction
8231943 27 the fear of the lord prolongeth days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened
8231944 6 by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil
8231945 23 the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil
8231946 the remarkable thing about fearing god is that when you fear god you fear nothing else whereas if you do not fear god you fear everything else
8231947 fear is f alse e ducation a ppearing r eal
8231948 who lives in fear will never be a free man
8231949 27 consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these 28 if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith 29 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind 30 for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things 31 but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you 32 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
8231950 i am with you always even unto the end of the world
8231951 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
8231952 6 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand 7 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
8231953 feed your faith and your fears will starve to death
8231954 fear knocked at the door faith answered no one was there
8231955 fear and faith cannot keep house together when one enters the other departs
8231956 fear imprisons faith liberates fear paralyzes faith empowers fear disheartens faith encourages fear sickens faith heals fear makes useless faith makes serviceable and most of all fear puts hopelessness at the heart of life while faith rejoices in its god
8231957 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
8231958 discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation
8231959 show me a thoroughly satisfied man and i will show you a failure
8231960 there are two kinds of discontent in this world the discontent that works and the discontent that wrings its hands the first gets what it wants and the second loses what it has
8231961 3 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints 4 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks 5 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
8231962 whenever you find yourself disposed to uneasiness or murmuring at anything that is the effect of gods providence look upon yourself as denying either the wisdom or goodness of god
8231963 complaining about our lot in life might seem quite innocent in itself but god takes it personally
8231964 the contented man is never poor the discontented never rich
8231965 it is not the man who has too little but the man who craves more who is poor
8231966 10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer
8231967 13 and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me 14 and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you 15 and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
8231968 4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you
8231969 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee 6 so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
8231970 7 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you 8 for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened 9 or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone 11 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
8231971 29 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father 30 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered 31 fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
8231972 11 not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content 12 i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need 13 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
8231973 contentment is the power to get out of any situation all there is in it
8231974 contentment is not the fulfillment of what you want but the realization of how much you already have
8231975 all the world lives in two tents content and discontent
8231976 9 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you
8231977 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
8231978 can you help me unravel my latest mistake i dont love him winter just wasnt my season

8232035 another unforgettable memory will be georgias flak jacketed president cowering on the ground as a russian plane flies over the town of gori bravado turning into humiliation is a metaphor for the whole foolish adventure georgian men are hospitable and engaging but fond of bombast and empty macho gestures unlike the chechens who have fought russians for centuries georgians prefer poetry and vineyards to the challenge of war
8232036 el esfuerzo que mostraron todos por que me quedase hizo que no me pensase demasiado mi renovaci n una vez que empezamos a negociar con el villarreal no tard en tomar la decisi n quiero estar aqu los pr ximos a os
8232037 una vez que empezamos a hablar con el villarreal el real madrid qued en un segundo plano no hay que darle m s vueltas al tema del real madrid s lo faltaba ponernos de acuerdo y todo ha sido muy f cil
8232038 la plantilla del villarreal que estuvo convulsionada va a seguir normal y corriente queremos hacer un equipo grande y fuerte y para eso hemos hecho este grand simo esfuerzo
8232039 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8232040 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8232041 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8232042 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8232043 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8232044 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8232045 but when i got down there i knew it was my cat because they all have their own voice
8232046 its a miracle im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy
8232047 this morning was the first time shed jumped onto my bed again

8232049 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8232050 were not afraid of anything of the prospect of a cold war
8232051 of course we dont want that in this situation everything depends on the stand of the world community and our partners in the west
8232052 but if they choose a confrontational scenario we will be responsive
8232053 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8232054 of course this raises some questions because normally battleships do not deliver aid and if it is a battleship diplomacy or rather battleship humanitarian diplomacy of course it does not make the situation more stable
8232055 but this is the choice of those who deliver aid
8232056 this is like a bullfight in spain when someone sticks a knife in the bull and it is bleeding and people are waiting for the bull to die
8232057 each case of recognition is by its nature a separate case a special case in kosovo a special case in south ossetia and abkhazia
8232058 this super tough attitude angered russia and finally it kind of took the bit between its teeth and said all right if this is the way you make the world see it we shall go the way we want
8232059 this decision is fraught with serious consequences and primarily with a deepening crisis in russias relations with the west
8232060 the war with georgia dealt these relations a crucial blow but the kremlin does not care it is willing to demonstrate that it can afford to ignore western opinion
8232061 we have already seen the georgian army cannot resist the russian army and i dont see that any western countries are eager to send their forces here
8232062 its high time to understand whats happening in georgia is not about georgia its about the world order
8232063 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
8232064 we are in for a long period of mutual malevolence

8232071 isv virtual appliances should underpin a new surge in cloud use followed by self service mechanisms and enterprise connectors enabling organizations to cloudburst to using cloud services
8232072 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8232073 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8232074 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8232075 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8232076 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2
8232077 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers

8232084 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex
8232085 i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 percent
8232086 there was a year left on my existing contract so im really pleased to have been able to sort out this new contract now
8232087 its obvious to everybody at the ospreys that there are great things happening here weve got a quality squad and great coaches theres a real buzz about the place and were confident about our chances for the new season its clearly something that any player would want to be a part of
8232088 last season was a fantastic one for me personally i really made my mark in the side had plenty of game time made the wales squad and now i want to build on that over the next four years there are plenty of good centres at the ospreys so i cant take anything for granted but the situation is that the competition for places will benefit me will benefit the ospreys and will benefit wales with so many quality players pushing for two starting spots were all pushing each other onto better things as we realise that we have to work hard just to get near the squad
8232089 although still a youngster andrew has already proven his worth to the ospreys with more than 70 appearances to his credit already and last season we really saw him starting to make an impact
8232090 there is a specific amount which tottenham have offered it suits us
8232091 provided roman agrees on a contract with the british side we are ready to release him
8232092 more than that i believe that such proposals do not often come for a footballer maybe once in their lifetime

8232104 we reject any threat to the unity and sovereignty of lebanon especially from israel
8232105 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
8232106 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final
8232107 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
8232108 if you can take money from drug dealers and spend it on the police department and the kids from this community i have no problem with that
8232109 if someone needed to do something for kids we always said yes
8232110 we will use the money to make advance payments for aircrafts and for operating expenses nedungadi said
8232111 we are in discussions with other institutions also but it will be too premature to give details as nothing has been sanctioned
8232112 the fact that the economy grows that it produces more goods and services one year than it did in the previous one no longer ensures that most families will benefit from its growth for the first time on record an economic expansion seems to have ended without family income having risen substantially most families are still making less after accounting for inflation than they were in 2000 for these workers roughly the bottom 60 percent of the income ladder economic growth has become a theoretical concept rather than the wellspring of better medical care a new car a nicer house a better life than their parents had
8232113 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
8232114 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
8232115 the christ on campus initiative cci is a ministry created for the purpose of preparing and circulating literature for college and university students addressing an array of important intellectual and practical issues from an evangelical christian perspective this initiative is made possible by generous support from the carl f h henry center for theological understanding trinity evangelical divinity school deerfield il and the mac foundation fort collins co the editorial team led by d a carson commissions top evangelical scholars to oversee the creation and distribution of a variety of resources for university students the goal of these resources is that they be intellectually rigorous culturally relevant persuasive in argument and faithful to historic evangelical christianity
8232116 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
8232117 people said hold it we dont want our infrastructure owned by foreigners

8232119 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing
8232120 look at the physical neglect crumbling bridges the issue of energy security environmental concerns
8232121 we are facing an infrastructure crisis in this country that threatens our status as an economic superpower and threatens the health and safety of the people we serve
8232122 our infrastructure is crumbling from bridges in minnesota to our airports and freeways
8232123 you can see and understand the businesses involved for example ships come into the port unload containers reload containers and leave
8232124 ten to 20 years from now infrastructure could be larger than real estate
8232125 the fact that the private sector raised 1 4 billion for the beltway project shows that even projects like hot lanes that are considered high risk can be developed and financed privately and that has huge implications for other large metro areas
8232126 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8232127 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8232128 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8232129 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8232130 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8232131 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8232132 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation
8232133 the criminal court has approved arrest warrants for nine people as proposed by the police including five pad leaders
8232134 i ask protesters of the pad to please withdraw from the government house compound immediately you can rally somewhere else
8232135 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8232136 they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8232137 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8232138 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8232139 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8232140 were focusing on the fact that were in the sports entertainment business and we have to interact with fans and sponsors
8232141 this is not meant to be punitive in any way there are very few players who dont speak english
8232142 we dont think suspensions will happen but if they do were not going to say boom go home and try again next year
8232143 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8232144 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8232145 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8232146 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision

8232161 its impossible to drive looking simply at the two dimensional night view display
8232162 and because the screen isnt in your direct field of view its difficult to monitor it while driving
8232163 in order to get to the mass market it has to enhance the driving experience
8232164 it has to make it easier to drive give you valuable information to make driving the vehicle easier or enhance the info tainment value of the driving experience

8232169 entschuldigung darf ich sie einen kurzen moment anhalten ich w rde sie gern fragen was glauben in ihrem leben bedeutet

8232181 the copper wire they steal is expensive enough to replace but the cost of network outages and repairs can be astronomical
8232182 youre at the greatest copper theft risk at your unmanned sites
8232183 theyre in remote areas where no one is physically able to watch the site fortunately you have several good choices for electronic surveillance
8232184 but you can deploy an effective monitoring system so you can swiftly respond weve had cases where clients using our system alerted police of a copper theft in progress the police were able to catch the criminals and stop the theft
8232185 dps telecom succeeds because we dont let our clients fail were committed to solving our clients problems 100 and we back it up with a no risk money back guarantee on all our products
8232186 our goal is advancing wound care by uncovering novel technologies empowering caregivers and focusing on patients unmet needs helping to bring the tcc ez cast to market achieves all three if we are able to increase adoption of a technology that is considered the gold standard for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers we feel confident this will lead to fewer amputations as we know unfortunately there is a high mortality rate associated with diabetic ulcer related amputations being able to have such a dramatic effect on patients lives is very rewarding to all of us at derma sciences
8232187 each day there are more than 230 diabetes related amputations performed in the united states alone knowing that total contact casting the current gold standard was underutilized the company started to develop new approaches and technologies to make the procedure more efficient this allowed it to develop a unique market niche we are very excited about our agreement with derma sciences as they have developed a strong sales force in the wound healing market and should provide a broader reach for our unique products
8232188 muchos dise adores buscaron materiales alternativos que permitieran reemplazar los utilizados hasta ese entonces siempre buscando innovar los procesos productivos y explotando las posibilidades de los mismos
8232189 buenos aires fue seleccionada como ciudad del dise o porque cuenta con un fuerte impulso p blico y privado de inserci n y desarrollo de esa disciplina y porque adem s se ha convertido en terreno f rtil para la producci n de bienes de consumo diferenciados e intensivos en dise o contando con una gran oferta de profesionales y centros de estudio investigaci n e innovaci n generando ptimas oportunidades para detectar nuevas tendencias de consumo que inspiren a las empresas a generar productos novedosos lamentablemente la situaci n econ mica en argentina complica mucho la exportaci n y posicionamiento de los productos a nivel mundial los costos cambian constantemente y a los dise adores les cuesta mucho participar en ferias de dise o internacional
8232190 no se nota mucho las creaciones que tengan un valor hist rico o relacionados con la cultura inglesa en s sino un dise o m s internacional m s masivo los costos de producci n son muy elevados por lo que este proceso siempre se realiza en pa ses con menores costos pero que est n siendo muy criticados por la explotaci n de sus recursos humanos
8232191 en general los productos que se comercializan en las boutiques y grandes tiendas han pasado muchos controles de calidad previamente se vende mucho los dise os que usan los personajes famosos se sigue mucho la moda del momento cuando se compra una prenda se lo hace pensando que s lo se va a usar mientras dure la temporada
8232192 el mayor desaf o es hacer que los potenciales compradores acepten que los productos que se dise an en argentina son de buena calidad y que tienen mucho valor agregado conseguir compradores a nivel tiendas es muy dificil por los los costos de nuestros productos es muy dificil competir con los productos que llegan de china tailandia etc

8232205 some whod never thought of writing poetry discovered a talent they never knew they had
8232206 they make things that are beautiful and beauty is really a lost ecology
8232207 i think one of the intuitive responses was to make the exhibit a counterpoint to these platonic geometries
8232208 to understand it as an object as a piece of furniture is to give it a certain level of consciousness
8232209 to objectify it is to give it a meaning you couldnt necessarily convey in a two dimensional map
8232210 present people with a constellation where they can start triangulating their understanding and build their own perspective
8232211 oh well that just ingratiated you to me ive never heard the f word before so its ok
8232212 are they going to come for the pay or to make a difference for students
8232213 i dont consider this merit pay because everyone would get a base pay raise

8232215 im looking at a 73 percent raise in one year

8232218 teacher morale problems stemming from the creation of unfair competition
8232219 theyre going to ask teachers to vote on this plan before determining how were going to be evaluated for performance pay
8232220 numerous plans have begun in the last 40 years but they flat run out of money
8232221 theyre often programs that we love but when they require new money they lose their luster
8232222 even though we have due process under the old contract weve had people illegally terminated

8232245 hidden truth how information management mistakes wreak havoc in the public sector
8232246 with todays inverted security model users share sensitive data inside and outside of the network and throughout the virtual environment
8232247 agencies are looking for solutions that protect information regardless of where it resides where it is sent or how it is used we found that enterprise rights management enables agencies to implement persistent security that successfully protects the actual data or document throughout its existence including while in use this is in contrast to traditional approaches that focus solely on data at rest or in transit
8232248 we were honored to collaborate with reymanngroup on this report the combination of increasing information protection regulations and the need to collaborate has created an urgent need among agencies for better security that is less invasive
8232249 liquid machines is well positioned to help our clients balance security with productivity with an information centric approach that secures the data itself not just the device

8232263 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8232264 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8232265 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8232266 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8232267 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8232268 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8232269 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8232270 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8232271 from a buddhist point of view religion is a means not an end

8232283 on visits to the homes of friends with small children one finds their toys strewn everywhere their drawings on the refrigerator
8232284 all this concern about children has exercised a subtle but pervasive tyranny of its own
8232285 more and more attention centered on them their upbringing their small accomplishments and their right relationship with parents and grandparents
8232286 this is what i call kindergarchy dreary boring sadly misguided kindergarchy
8232287 no effort on behalf of ones children is too much nor is any expenditure too great
8232288 my mother never read to me and my father took me to no ballgames though we did go to golden gloves fights a few times
8232289 when i began my modest athletic career my parents never came to any of my games and i should have been embarrassed had they done so my parents never met any of my girlfriends in high school
8232290 no photographic or video record exists of my uneven progress through early life
8232291 when we were together at family meals and at other times we laughed a lot my parents my brother and i but we did not openly exhibit exuberant affection for one another we did not hug and i do not remember often kissing my mother or her kissing me
8232292 neither my mother nor my father ever told me they loved me nor did i tell them that i loved them i always assumed their love and as later years would prove when they came to my aid in small crises i was not wrong to do so
8232293 i was always telling my two sons how much i loved them i told them this so often that i should imagine they must have begun to doubt that i had any real feeling for them whatsoever
8232294 my own hope is that the absurdity of current arrangements will in time be felt and people will gradually realize the foolishness of continuing to lavish so much painstaking attention on their children
8232295 only then will parents once again be able to live their own lives free to concentrate on their work lifes adult pleasures and those responsibilities that fall well outside the prison of the permanent kindergarten they have themselves erected and have been forced to live in as hostages
8232296 god is now here the lord is in this place and i was not aware of it

8232298 we are not going to be part of mugabes government we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai form a transitional government

8232300 we have made progress on a number of initiatives that have contributed to
8232301 earlier this week we signed an agreement for the sale of our non core misses catalog titles to orchard brands and announced our plans to explore the sale of our figis gifts in good taste catalog business based in wisconsin these announcements support our strategy to refocus our energies on our core brands and to leverage our leading market share position in womens specialty plus apparel our decision to consider selling our figis business should not be seen in any way as a negative reflection on the performance of the figis business in fact figis continues to perform quite profitably and generates substantial cash flow we and our board of directors are committed to identifying an appropriate buyer for this attractive asset but will only do so in a transaction that we deem financially favorable

8232323 therefore not unexpected to find infected animals in the protection zone
8232324 these cases emphasise the need for farmers to be aware of the risks of importing animals from within restricted zones
8232325 it is the only effective tool to protect susceptible animals the message remains clear dont hesitate vaccinate
8232326 bringing stock into the uk from bluetongue infected areas of the continent particularly at this time of year represents a massive risk to domestic animals and should be undertaken with extreme caution
8232327 all uk farmers should vaccinate their stock as soon as the protection zone allows to give maximum protection to both their own animals and those of their fellow farmers

8232401 este normal sa fie asa de vreme ce creditele de consum sunt negarantate iar cele ipotecare imobiliare sunt garantate cu ipoteci asupra imobilelor cumparate de aceea ne asteptam ca bancile comerciale sa manifeste o prudenta mai mare in cazul acordarii creditelor de consum decat in cazul creditelor destinate achizitiilor imobiliare dosarele se vor solutiona cu mai mare greutate cel putin o perioada de timp si acest lucru se va repercuta intr o intarziere a finalizarii tranzactiilor
8232402 acest lucru nu s a intamplat iar noile norme bnr sunt menite sa stabilizeze mai mult piata si sa asigure o politica de risc foarte buna pentru a se evita orice evenimente neplacute care ar afecta in mod direct cumparatorii
8232403 noile norme legate de gradul de indatorare si conditii luate in considerare pentru acordarea unui credit ne aduc in situatia de acum trei ani cand doar 30 40 din apartamente erau contractate cu credit bancar iar restul prin rate platite direct dezvoltatorului efectul va fi probabil resimtit printr o scadere a tranzactiilor in prima faza dar mai ales prin reintoarcerea clientilor la metodele de plata care presupun un avans platit la semnarea antecontractului ce poate varia intre 20 si 30 din pret rate pe perioada constructiei intre 30 si 60 iar restul la livrare
8232404 implementarea acestor norme de catre banci va presupune o anumita perioada de timp in care producerea imediata a unor asemenea efecte ar fi putin probabil sa cunoasca o dinamica accentuata in conditiile in care generarea lor are la baza mai multi factori de regula pe anumite segmente ale pietei imobiliare s ar putea resimti anumite variatii implicit scaderi in functie de gradul efectiv de inasprire a conditiilor de creditare impuse de institutiile bancare
8232405 pe termen scurt initiativa va descuraja unii cumparatori dar nu cred ca numarul acestora este atat de mare incat sa produca efecte majore asupra pietei imobiliare majoritatea oamenilor au o anumita constanta sau crestere de 10 20 a veniturilor de la un an la altul astfel incat in general considerarea venitului pe intreg anul precedent nu va face diferenta de plafon salarial de la un credit pentru o garsoniera la unul pentru un apartament
8232406 ceea ce mi se pare cel mai important este efectul unor astfel de masuri pe termen mediu si lung intrucat sunt masuri menite sa protejeze piata imobiliara si populatia evident de caderi dramatice datorate incapacitatii achitarii creditelor
8232407 persoanele aflate la limita acordarii unor credite imobiliare va trebui sa mai astepte o perioada dar pentru apartamentele de 2 3 camere care constituie majoritatea tranzactiilor oricum familiile trebuiau sa aiba venituri destul de mari aici nu cred ca vor fi schimbari semnificative

8232432 i spoke to shaun and he felt with a couple of games under his belt that he would be back to 100 so i had no hesitation in calling him up
8232433 he has started the season well and he gives us a different dimension and he is in good goalscoring form
8232434 alan has progressed in the last few years into a top class international full back some people would say one of the best full backs in britain

8232438 there have been a number of serious incidents in rural areas and it is dangerous for farmers or agricultural workers to visit former properties or other agricultural areas

8232440 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8232441 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8232442 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8232443 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8232444 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8232445 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8232446 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly

8232501 the discipline regarding the denial of holy communion to those obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin
8232502 john paul ii continuing the constant teaching of the church has reiterated many times that those who are directly involved in lawmaking bodies have a grave and clear obligation to oppose any law that attacks human life
8232503 another fundamental right of the faithful as noted in canon 213 is the right to receive assistance by the sacred pastors from the spiritual goods of the church especially the word of god and the sacraments in view of the law that sacred ministers may not deny the sacraments to those who opportunely ask for them are properly disposed and are not prohibited by law from receiving them canon 843 1 there should be no such refusal to any catholic who presents himself for holy communion at mass except in cases presenting a danger of grave scandal to other believers arising out of the persons unrepented public sin or obstinate heresy or schism publicly professed or declared

8232514 the 2007 2008 season was definitely a challenging one for us alcohol fuelled disorder was the most prevalent problem with an increase from 305 to 337 incidents we also had 25 police officers assaulted during the season the highest number ever recorded by btp
8232515 we did however get a better grip on organised hooligan elements through increased use of football banning orders on known trouble makers consequently we had a reduction in serious incidents from 83 in the 2006 07 season to 63 last season
8232516 in the same time period we secured 122 football banning orders with many cases still pending
8232517 this is something we will continue to pursue to ensure that those who engage in disorder are banned from travelling to or from attending football matches
8232518 we will use all the tools at our disposal to rid the railway system of football troublemakers
8232519 with the ever expanding list of fixtures including the creation of the european champions league the pressures on us as a force to provide policing for multiple matches in multiple leagues across the country has never been greater
8232520 a forum which brings together key groups from the railway industry the fa football league and premier league supporters associations and btp has been also been set up to work through any issues that may be causing concern
8232521 we would appeal to fans ahead of the new football season not to over indulge in alcohol
8232522 officers will be out in force across the country monitoring fixtures and working with football clubs and colleagues from other forces to ensure each match is policed successfully and with the minimum amount of trouble

8232550 very few athletes achieve the honour of being selected to represent their country as an olympian and i am sure that all of scotland will join me in congratulating the very successful team gb its 32 scottish members and our four scots medallists
8232551 the scottish governments overriding priority is to see an increase in sporting participation rates throughout scotland
8232552 the success of our four medallists can only be a major influence on our young people and help inspire the heroes of tomorrow
8232553 the achievements of the four scottish medallists will hopefully inspire and motivate our young people to take part in sport and physical activity and engender the belief that they too can succeed

8232563 night view assist debuted on the s class in 2006
8232564 what we like about it is it is infrared based its more active than the heat based versions
8232565 its impossible to drive looking simply at the two dimensional night view display
8232566 and because the screen isnt in your direct field of view its difficult to monitor it while driving
8232567 in order to get to the mass market it has to enhance the driving experience
8232568 it has to make it easier to drive give you valuable information to make driving the vehicle easier or enhance the info tainment value of the driving experience
8232569 could potentially reduce the incidence of rear end crashes and harm caused by tailgating behavior

8232581 i think we have to accept that exclusivity is not a thing of the past but it is probably with publishers
8232582 we might do a few things where we feel that we need a push here or a push there
8232583 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
8232584 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop
8232585 they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers

8232633 we are not making excuses for reporting a negative earnings performance but we want our shareholders to understand the industry dynamics that came into play some of which are still in force
8232634 we have decided that we can create and sustain more shareholder value by putting our resources behind a smaller number of very large opportunities we are already seeing the value of this strategy in our ingredients solutions segment where we have narrowed the portfolio of products value price and cost are producing a winning combination there
8232635 categories that have been the cornerstone of our sales such as high end textiles and collectibles were down sharply this demonstrates consumers lack of confidence that the economy and home values will improve in the short term the regions with the largest sales declines continue to be the areas most affected by housing such as florida california nevada and arizona the impact of lowered sales was partially offset by a reduction in sg amp a costs of 6 5 and a 19 7 reduction in inventory on a per store basis we expect our investory levels at the end of this year to be flat versus last year we were able to accomplish this despite the inflationary environment we also dramatically improved our balance sheet by lowering inventory and reducing revolver debt by 48 million
8232636 we believe that relocating and expanding stores in our existing store base will improve the overall portfolio of our stores the flexibility in our execution will better position us for long term growth while maintaining a low cost per square foot expense

8232652 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8232653 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8232654 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8232728 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8232729 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8232730 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8232731 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8232732 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8232733 there may be some hard feelings but i think people look back on his administration as a period of peace and economic prosperity
8232734 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8232735 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8232736 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8232737 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8232738 if anything i wouldnt be at all surprised to see clinton give a very strong speech in support of obama
8232739 the relaxed group dont let email exert any pressure on their lives
8232740 they treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail ill fetch it ill deal with it in my own time but im not going to let it upset me
8232741 both slot machines and email follow something called a variable interval reinforcement schedule
8232742 which has been established as the way to train in the strongest habits this means that rather than reward an action every time it is performed you reward it sometimes but not in a predictable way so with email usually when i check it there is nothing interesting but every so often theres something wonderful an invite out or maybe some juicy gossip and i get a reward
8232743 because they dont help people to change their behaviour while they are actually using email once your email is back youre going to respond to it in the same old ways unless you replace your bad habits
8232744 i use other tools where people are more comfortable hanging out ive got a whole set of contacts who love twitter and if i want to reach them quickly then thats where theyll be
8232745 ways of reducing the disruption caused by email ways of managing email so that it doesnt run your day organisational norms build up and people come to expect others to answer emails within a given timeframe whether that email is important or not

8232758 quien no me contesto dici ndole que me acercara cuatro temas prioritarios e hice lo mismo con la gente de r o grande para poner en la mesa ocho temas fundamentales que me parece son suficientes para preparar una pre respuesta y para que la gobernadora este documentada como para contestarles
8232759 tiene que ser para construir porque si uno va a protestar y a gritar nadie va a escuchar nada y no se podr dar respuestas
8232760 yo no estoy dispuesto a eso y la gobernadora creo que tampoco
8232761 es un lugar amplio de debate donde los protagonistas son de distintos estamentos
8232762 por una ley sancionada hace mucho tiempo y que ha sido aplicada espor dicamente
8232763 nosotros decidimos volver a ponerla en vigencia y generamos el mbito a trav s del decreto 878
8232764 se establecen temas y en este caso se esta tratando el plan plurianual de obras que no es un asunto menor como para restarle importancia y poner en el tapete la discusi n de un decreto que no est vigente
8232765 es el mbito id neo para darle prolijidad a la administraci n p blica
8232766 puede haber otra forma de plantear la organizaci n del estado no podemos dejar de plantearlo y discutirlo
8232767 porque actualmente se est tratando el plan plurianual de obras y el gobierno considera que la uocra tiene m s para aportar que el gremio estatal porque est involucrado directamente independientemente de que ate pueda tener una idea brillante sobre este plan
8232768 yo no s si esto es tan il gico como para que ellos lo vean equivocado
8232769 porque ate est n pidiendo participaci n permanente en el consejo cuando ate es un gremio adherido a la cta y esta central es miembro permanente del organismo
8232770 sirvi para lacerar la administraci n p blica y le cort la cabeza al empleado p blico y el decreto que proponemos ingres en un lugar de dialogo donde seguramente ellos ser n llamados a participar el d a que se le d fecha al tratamiento y luego deber tambi n pasar por la legislatura para que entre en vigencia
8232771 ellos de ate lo pueden decir como bandera de lucha pero nosotros no nos podemos hacer eco ni desde el gobierno pensar que es as
8232772 the north atlantic council condemns the decision of the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetian and abkhazian regions of georgia and calls upon russia to reverse its decision
8232773 russias actions have called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8232774 street protests and rallies are banned under an ongoing state of emergency
8232775 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8232776 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8232777 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8232778 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8232779 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8232780 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8232781 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8232782 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8232783 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8232784 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8232785 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8232786 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8232787 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later

8232807 and having a facility where larger and more expensive projects can be produced as well as the personnel to help facilitate it is all part of building this infrastructure thats really going to create an industry cluster and help south carolina move to that next level

8232823 we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8232824 this administration failed to believe in what we can achieve as a nation when all of us work together john mccain promises more of the same
8232825 and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq i dont know about you but thats just not right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8232826 lets cast our votes for john mccain obamas new what can he do to clean up the morass
8232827 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8232828 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8232829 it takes no account of the views of the hundreds of thousands of georgians and others who have been forced to abandon their homes in the two territories
8232830 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8232831 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
8232832 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
8232833 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
8232834 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
8232835 should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties

8232854 uu migas no 22 tahun 2001 yang harus disempurnakan karena uu ini empat pasalnya sudah diamputasi oleh mk dan amat sangat tidak investor friendly menyebabkan eksporasi dan investasi anjlok luar biasa dan tidak ada lapangan cadangan baru ditemukan dan hanya andalkan lapangan yang sudah tua
8232855 karena kondisi seperti itu saya sarankan segera amandemen uu migas agar investasi kembali marak dan investasi pencarian lapangan cadangan baru kembali bergairah agar potensi minyak kita kembali ditemukan
8232856 ini terjadi karena uu migas yang menyebabkan bp migas sebagai pelaksana pengelola kegiatan kekayaan migas dari hulu tidak bisa melakukan trust action perminyakan dan berbisnis karena statusnya sebagai badan hukum negara yang tidak bisa berbisnis akhirnya menyuruh pihak lain yang melakukan dan akibatnya negara rugi terlalu besar karena dijual terlalu rendah
8232857 karena tidak ada dewan komisaris secara internal dia melakukan kontrol terhadap
8232858 solusi terbaiknya ya bubarkan saja bp migas ini dan diganti badan usaha milik negara
8232859 carut marut migas memang biasnya ada disitu yang menghilangkan peran negara dan menguntungkan trader dan mengakibatkan produksi minyak kita turun terus karena uu itu menyatakan bp migas tidak bisa menjual minyak karena harus dijual ke pihak ketiga yaitu trader dan oleh karena itu direkomendasikan untuk diganti uu migas ini
8232860 tahun sebelumnya ifc sudah berinvestasi di danamon dan bii total investasi keduanya mencapai lebih dari us 100 juta untuk bantuan kredit porsi danamon lebih besar dari bii

8232883 isv virtual appliances should underpin a new surge in cloud use followed by self service mechanisms and enterprise connectors enabling organizations to cloudburst to using cloud services
8232884 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8232885 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8232886 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8232887 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8232888 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2
8232889 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers

8232917 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8232918 graffiti can be seen on the walls in shiite districts of baghdad saying iraq for sale see maliki
8232919 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
8232920 if you ask the prime minister what happens if the situation on the ground changes before 2011 then he would obviously say that the dates might need to be changed

8232938 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
8232939 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
8232940 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
8232941 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
8232942 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
8232943 mr ganleys unexpected late withdrawal came as shock because he had personally assured me that he would be there to take part in the debate i feel badly let down by mr ganley for not keeping his word
8232944 faced with such heavyweights mr ganley has chickened out and made america his priority instead of honouring his commitment to take part in the only public forum on the difficulties facing ireland in the wake of last junes defeat of the lisbon referendum
8232945 declan ganley took part in extremely robust debates during the campaign i think its fairly clear that he hasnt chickened out of any opportunity to address anybody about the lisbon treaty
8232946 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
8232947 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
8232948 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
8232949 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
8232950 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
8232951 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
8232952 european affairs minister dick roche raised the prospect of a second lisbon treaty referendum last night saying he believes it is the appropriate response to the countrys continuing political crisis
8232953 the catholic primate of all ireland yesterday voiced fears that some christians had voted against the treaty because the eu was becoming ever more secular in its outlook
8232954 mr roche said if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
8232955 some members of government may be relieved that the unpalatable truth is now being aired
8232956 a government spokesman said last night mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put
8232957 the differing views from senior members of church and state will this week reopen the entire lisbon debate but may not bring closer the finding of a solution that would ensure our continued full membership of the eu
8232958 ireland has been given until october to tell our partner states what we intend to do to rectify the situation
8232959 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu mr roche said we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
8232960 the european affairs minister privately does not see any chance of resolving the problem by trying to put elements of lisbon into irish law by passing bills in the dail if the legislative route was not adopted the first time out it could not be resorted to now he believes
8232961 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted
8232962 the government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 june those matters then have to be addressed
8232963 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is
8232964 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again
8232965 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
8232966 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year
8232967 a substantial majority of voters in five large european union countries want a referendum on the blocs new reform treaty according to a poll published thursday
8232968 in lisbon and to avoid another defeat the managers of the eu have decided not to hold any referenda at all
8232969 this is crossing the rubicon after which there will be no more sovereign states in europe with fully fledged governments and parliaments which represent legitimate interests of their citizens but only one state will remain basic things will be decided by a remote federal government in brussels and for example czech citizens will be only a tiny particle whose voice and influence will be almost zero we are against a european superstate
8232970 as the former british prime minister of england during the late 1800s benjamin disraeli wrote
8232971 the irish government is especially wary of being seen to be offering a prescription to the people before it even receives an analysis of why the people voted no the results of a major survey of public opinion on the referendum will be received next month and taoiseach brian cowen will then bring his analysis of why the plebiscite was defeated to other eu heads of government
8232972 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
8232973 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
8232974 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on june 12
8232975 minister roches comments may simply have the effect of driving even more people into the no camp
8232976 the only initiative they have come up with was a totally futile plan to set up a new committee which would duplicate the work of the existing committee on european affairs
8232977 we have had nothing from the taoiseach or the minister for foreign affairs
8232978 there is no political crisis as minister roche has suggested
8232979 there is simply a political task to be dealt with the irish people like the french and dutch before them rejected this treaty a new deal now needs to be negotiated
8232980 i think he is jumping the gun i dont think its helpful we may have to say at the end of the day that the people have spoken and take the consequences but i dont think its helpful to be coming out in the month of august with proposals or solutions one way or the other
8232981 concerns over social and moral issues taxation and representation on the european commission
8232982 explaining the subject matter of referenda promoting public awareness and encouraging the electorate to vote
8232983 nothing whatsoever has been decided vis a vis the next step because were only in the process of analysis at this stage
8232984 people who are saying another referendum or legislation they are all jumping ahead to an outcome and the government isnt anywhere near that
8232985 a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
8232986 the government has made it clear that no option has been ruled in or out we cannot exclude that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
8232987 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
8232988 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on 12 june
8232989 i think he is jumping the gun i dont think its helpful i dont think its helpful to be coming out in the month of august with proposals or solutions one way or the other

8232992 hidden truth how information management mistakes wreak havoc in the public sector
8232993 with todays inverted security model users share sensitive data inside and outside of the network and throughout the virtual environment
8232994 agencies are looking for solutions that protect information regardless of where it resides where it is sent or how it is used we found that enterprise rights management enables agencies to implement persistent security that successfully protects the actual data or document throughout its existence including while in use this is in contrast to traditional approaches that focus solely on data at rest or in transit
8232995 we were honored to collaborate with reymanngroup on this report the combination of increasing information protection regulations and the need to collaborate has created an urgent need among agencies for better security that is less invasive
8232996 liquid machines is well positioned to help our clients balance security with productivity with an information centric approach that secures the data itself not just the device

8233006 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
8233007 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat tactics

8233041 denver prosecutors charged a jail inmate friday with sending a threatening letter and white powder to a colorado campaign office for gop presidential candidate john mccain
8233042 president bush has provided a much needed solution to the national foreclosure problem in signing h r 3648 the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 but the sub prime mortgage problem continues to affect most markets nationwide the critical next step is locating and certifying a ground army of concerned professionals who can reach out to the multitude of homeowners who desperately need relief
8233043 while much has been said in the media to further educate the public about their options when facing foreclosure the vast majority of individuals in this situation simply dont know where to start program 3648 was enacted to handle the processing for qualified homeowners to either keep their home or go through a short sale
8233044 there is no cost for the program and the homeowner never needs to worry about future billing with caring well educated experienced professionals administering the program on a national scale our mission is to help thousands of homeowners avoid foreclosure
8233045 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8233046 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8233047 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8233050 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8233051 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8233052 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8233053 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8233054 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8233055 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8233056 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8233057 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8233091 there was a year left on my existing contract so im really pleased to have been able to sort out this new contract now
8233092 its obvious to everybody at the ospreys that there are great things happening here weve got a quality squad and great coaches theres a real buzz about the place and were confident about our chances for the new season its clearly something that any player would want to be a part of
8233093 last season was a fantastic one for me personally i really made my mark in the side had plenty of game time made the wales squad and now i want to build on that over the next four years there are plenty of good centres at the ospreys so i cant take anything for granted but the situation is that the competition for places will benefit me will benefit the ospreys and will benefit wales with so many quality players pushing for two starting spots were all pushing each other onto better things as we realise that we have to work hard just to get near the squad
8233094 although still a youngster andrew has already proven his worth to the ospreys with more than 70 appearances to his credit already and last season we really saw him starting to make an impact
8233095 on ne peut pas avoir une r gle pour certains et une r gle pour les autres
8233096 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8233097 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8233098 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8233099 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8233100 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8233101 in the five year struggle to finish the war in iraq military leaders and their troops have said a particular weapon is among the most effective in their arsenal american cash
8233102 soldiers and their commanders say the program works because there is little red tape allowing them to fill immediate needs in their assigned towns and cities on capitol hill and in the pentagon the program has become a sacred cow as one government auditor calls it few will openly criticize the popular program for fear of alienating the troops cerp was recently given an additional 1 2 billion to be split between iraq and afghanistan according to a july report by the office of the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction that money brings the programs total to 3 5 billion lawmakers also have proposed to exempt it from restrictions on the spending for large reconstruction projects in iraq in the future
8233103 about 1 billion of the money spent so far has gone to 605 projects that exceed the armys definition of small scale or more than 500 000 each and 880 million was spent on projects that took longer than 6 months considered the definition of short term by many commanders
8233104 gen peter w chiarelli who is vice chief of staff for the u s army and in 2006 served as commanding general of the multi national corps iraq said that he and commanders in the field have all seen violent incidents in certain areas decline when cerp spending goes up he said cerp is in fact a reconstruction program in addition to being a counterinsurgency weapon after the firefights of the initial invasion chiarelli said youve then got somebody coming around to a commander handing him a bag of 25 000 cash and saying to go rebuild iraq but chiarelli added that the military may not be equipped to maintain the schools clinics and water projects it builds with cerp money in one case in 2005 he said he brought water to 220 000 houses in the sadr city section of baghdad using cerp funds but when he went back a year later to check on whether the program had been expanded to more houses it hadnt the problem is follow through he said
8233105 when army gen david h petraeus led the 101st airborne divisions occupation of mosul and northern iraq in 2003 posters hung in barracks reading what have you done to win iraqi hearts and minds today then he and his troops started spending money 58 million from an early cerp fund that came from seized iraqi assets petraeus now the top u s commander in iraq was well schooled in the use of money in counterinsurgency he wrote his princeton university dissertation on the lessons of vietnam where the u s military used a tool for pacification that looked a lot like cerp at the start of the u s occupation many of iraqs villages experienced few results from the large scale rebuilding efforts managed from baghdad but a quick influx of cash from soldiers to fix urgent problems brought goodwill military leaders and experts said you cant shoot yourself out of an insurgency said marine col john a koenig who oversaw 160 million worth of cerp projects in anbar province last year a rifle only gets you so far it shows you have some force cerp allows you to develop our answer to al qaeda the program gives military leaders the flexibility to move quickly in an unstable cash only war zone
8233106 the tactic is similar to the way hezbollah operates in lebanon said koenig who was an adviser to one of the marine generals in charge of large dollar cerp projects
8233107 when cerp funds have been used for far bigger projects the results can be problematic management and accountability of large contracts can be difficult for military personnel who are fighting a war said james spike stephenson a former u s agency for international development director in iraq their major job became not just fighting the war but becoming the de facto reconstruction guys but theyre not trained to run and sustain them they are learning it on the battlefield outside kirkuk in northern iraq an 8 3 million water treatment project completed in february with cerp funds took more than two years and was 1 7 million over budget and it is not far from another water treatment system that usaid paid 4 1 million to build two years ago according to a top state department official involved in the broader reconstruction efforts he spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to undermine his relationships with his colleagues
8233108 with unemployment hovering at 60 percent in some areas of iraq cerps highest priority is creating local jobs along the highway leading to baghdad international airport long considered one of the most dangerous roads in the country because of the constant threat of improvised explosive devices workers were hired to paint a 900 000 mural depicting the progression of iraq from fishing villages with seagulls and boats to oil refineries millions more were spent to plant and cultivate date palms a crop decimated over the past two decades installing awnings worth 687 000 in a market in baghdad was justified partly because documents say adding the awnings will create 35 jobs for 3 months in the violence prone city of ramadi army capt nathan strickland and his battalion used cerp money to hire day laborers to clear away trash and rubble the military strategy get young men to pick up shovels instead of guns
8233109 the largest jobs program began in 2007 sons of iraq as it is now called has paid more than 100 000 iraqis 5 to 26 per day to guard checkpoints and patrol neighborhoods the united states has spent more than 250 million on the program so far records show petraeus has told congress that the salaries paid to the sons of iraq alone cost far less than the cost savings and vehicles not lost due to the enhanced security in local communities but members of congress military strategists and government auditors said the problem is that there is no obvious way to end the program in their latest report auditors at the special inspector generals office said the program is considered a temporary security measure but that only 14 000 sons of iraq members have transitioned to become part of the iraqi security force

8233116 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8233117 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8233118 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8233130 gerade die fp die im wiener gemenderat alle forderungen zur f rderung der unabh ngigkeit von migrantinnen ablehnt versucht sich hier als vermeintliche besch tzerin von unterdr ckten frauen aufzuspielen
8233131 warum fordert schock nicht gleich ein verbot von nonnengew ndern das w re wenigstens konsequent
8233132 gerade frauen die unterdr ckt werden egal aus welchem kulturkreis sie stammen m ssen durch ein engmaschiges netz an betreuungs und beratungseinrichtungen unterst tzt werden es m ssen die voraussetzungen f r eine gleichberechtigte teilhabe am gesellschaftlichen leben geschaffen werden und dazu z hlt auch die freie berufsaus bung

8233153 gracias al taller ves que no est s sola que los problemas que se te plantean a la hora de amamantar a tu hijo o en cualquier otro aspecto son muy parecidos a los de otras madres y eso te permite afrontarlos de otra forma la lactancia materna es fundamental para aprender a respetar la naturaleza del ni o y para entenderlo por eso hay que promoverla
8233154 no alimentar a un reci n nacido con la leche de su madre o suspender injustificadamente una lactancia materna por falta de informaci n o apoyo insuficiente o inadecuado supone riesgos y perjuicios innecesarios para la madre y el lactante que los profesionales de la salud debemos evitar poniendo todo nuestro empe o en ello

8233170 es uno de los focos que m s debemos controlar y en el que los conductores de los diferentes veh culos a motor deben aportar su civismo o por el contrario se exponen a ser sancionados
8233171 se va a seguir llevando a cabo al menos una vez al trimestre por parte de la polic a local de castell n ya que la sensibilizaci n entre los j venes es fundamental
8233172 la metodolog a a seguir ha sido a trav s de unos agentes provistos de son metro que han realizado las mediciones en veh culos susceptibles de ser estudiados y si se detectaba alguna irregularidad este veh culo ha sido interceptado por otros agentes unos metros m s adelante para proceder a la informar al conductor de la posible sanci n y en su caso inmovilizar el veh culo

8233179 absolutely no progress has been made in getting older people online and the spotlight is now on the government and the industry to get switched on nearly 7 million 70 per cent of people of 65 have never used the internet
8233180 as well as supporting digital unites silver surfers day campaign were working with 17 sheltered housing schemes to offer a get online package which contains computers two per site software and accessories plus a seven week training programme to get to grips with the net and free broadband for a year
8233181 were just going through the final checks and will be installing broadband and starting the training courses shortly

8233184 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8233185 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8233186 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8233187 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8233188 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8233189 well forward all of these to apple so that we can ensure that not only murderdrome but that any comic submitted to apple doesnt fall foul of the same censorship
8233190 the plan is to hold murderdrome and concentrate on our other titles which will be more apple friendly
8233191 creo que el alegato del fiscal alfredo terraf fue muy importante porque ha condensado en forma minuciosa y pormenorizada la enorme carga probatoria en contra de bussi y de men ndez
8233192 ha hecho una reconstrucci n hist rica del hecho que no deja lugar a dudas acerca de la responsabilidad de bussi y de men ndez pero lo m s importante de su s ntesis es que ha quedado demostrado cosa que no pudo ser refutada en el alegato de la defensa que ninguno de los testigos que declar en esta causa aun los que ha ofrecido la propia defensa ha desconocido la responsabilidad de bussi y de men ndez sobre la acusaci n en esta causa
8233193 me parece que el fiscal volvi a excederse en sus manifestaciones traspasando el l mite de su funci n inclusive refiri ndose a mi hermano por ricardo bussi y a m cuando no correspond a bajo ning n punto de vista le noto un encono personal que no se compadece con la investidura que desarrolla
8233194 creo que si el fiscal quiere hacer pol tica que se presente a elecciones a ver c mo le va pero no me parece correcto que aproveche un micr fono del tribunal oral para hacer manifestaciones de tinte exclusivamente ideol gicos y pol ticos
8233195 realmente hay que tener la cara muy dura para hacer eso pero mi padre se al le ha replicado con presteza a pesar de sus limitaciones y ha puesto en evidencia que al fiscal le falta autoridad moral para levantar hoy el dedo acusador puesto que 21 a os atr s no tuvo empacho en negociar en persona y reiteradamente con mi padre los electores para el cargo de gobernador
8233196 en los alegatos se plante el principio de contradicci n elemento fundamental de todo proceso penal dijo m s all de las diferencias de opini n con ella ha estudiado el expediente y ha valorado la prueba pero no ha conseguido de ninguna manera transmitirle al tribunal la falta de m rito de su defendido
8233197 en mi condici n de abogado estimo que todos los argumentos del ministerio p blico fueron destruidos uno a uno por una impecable exposici n jur dica de la defensora oficial ella se ci estrictamente a la cuesti n que nos llev a todos a ese estrado que es la lamentable situaci n por la que atraves la familia vargas aignasse y sobre la que nos hubiera gustado como a ellos dilucidar lo que realmente aconteci cosa que en este expediente no se ha dilucidado
8233198 ante la evidencia y las constancias legales espero una sentencia absolutoria por parte del tribunal que hasta la fecha ha actuado correctamente
8233199 le encanta la atenci n que recibe en las ceremonias y se toma su tiempo para inspeccionar las tropas
8233200 samantha is certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book shes the only one people want to read about
8233201 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8233202 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are

8233232 a tutti i giovani che hanno diritto a un educazione critica scientifica e laica
8233233 per il ministro il diritto alla vita assoluto disprezza tutta la conoscenza medica del nostro tempo il concetto di vita che il ministro aguirre usa completamente metafisico ci che si pu dimostrare scientificamente che l embrione di 12 settimane non altro che un assieme di cellule senza il sufficiente sviluppo per essere considerato una persona
8233234 ignora il ministro aguirre nella sua argomentazione tutto il diritto comparativo e il modo in che si risolto il tema nei paesi democratici del mondo si il diritto alla vita cos assoluto come pretende il ministro allora la spagna la francia l italia i paesi bassi la svezia o la gran bretagna oltre a molti stati degli stati uniti dovranno essere considerati da sua signoria come nazione genocide
8233235 il progetto elaborato dal ministro salvador aguirre anguiano pieno di importanti omissioni tra le quali il rispetto ai diritti costituzionali delle donne se dovessimo seguire le opinioni del ministro dovremo sottomettere la donna all uomo in materia di diritti sessuali
8233236 non sorprende assolutamente nulla il progetto del ministro aguirre gi che si tratta forse del ministro pi conservatore e di estrema destra della suprema corte di giustizia della nazione si tratta di un progetto di 610 pagine con argomenti pi che tutto moralisti metafisici spiritisti e tradizionalisti che veramente filosofici e giuridici un discorso panfletario no un assieme di ragionamenti giuridici coerenti risulta paradossale che nella proposta di aguirre si citano antecedenti di diritto comparativo e si dica che le risoluzioni siano state un senso diverso i tribunali costituzionali pi avanzati e rispettati del mondo come quello degli stati uniti della colombia della germania e della spagna si sono pronunciati verso l autodeterminazione la libert e il diritto della donna di disporre del suo proprio corpo
8233237 nel nostro paese predomina la tradizione conservatrice e probabilmente la proposta del ministro aguirre sia appoggiata dalla maggioranza dei ministri dell alto tribunale nonostante non si riesce a vedere che sia capace di raggiungere quella maggioranza qualificata di otto voti per ottenere la sentenza di incostituzionalit da dove possibile pensare che la legalizzazione dell aborto nella capitale del messico continuer in piedi nella fine i diritti trionferanno
8233238 la legalizzazione dell aborto sar approvata il fine aprile e nessuno lo potr impedire tutti quelli che non sono d accordo debbono abbandonare le pressioni politiche e lasciare i deputati lavorare
8233239 siamo solo in attesa che questo inviato del vaticano faccia un pronunciamento contro l aborto in quel momento un gruppo di deputati locali e federali andr alla segreteria del governo per richiedere che questo rappresentante della santa sede sia espulso del nostro paese
8233240 non si pu ammettere che si diffondano per i mezzi di comunicazione concetti medievali circa i diritti della donne
8233241 facesse valere la legge purch la chiesa la smettesse di intervenire nel dibattito sulla legalizzazione dell aborto
8233242 manca la capacit alla chiesa cattolica per ammettere la sconfitta davanti alla legalizzazione dell aborto h molta pena di vedere una istituzione cos importante come la chiesa cattolica in questo stato di incapacit di ammettere una sconfitta nel campo civile
8233243 siamo tutti d accordo sulla necessit di lavorare di un modo sistematico per rafforzare le interpretazioni delle applicazioni in ogni singolo paese delle normative internazionali sui diritti riproduttivi per ci che vogliamo non soltanto stabilire le normative per il comportamento dei governi ci che si pretende assicurare che i governi capiscano che loro sono obbligati a seguire queste normative

8233266 the fact that the loss of objectivity and the intrinsic value of the currency which is involved i e inflation will sooner or later make necessary on pain of ever increasing dislocation a growing degree of social control for the partial character of the policy will itself lead on to further measures the very fact that no stability no permanently workable solution can be found within the limits of this policy will ensure that once a community has been driven by events to tackle its problems in this way it cannot halt at the first stage but must of necessity push on to more thorough going measures of re organization

8233300 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit

8233302 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers

8233319 cannabis has absolutely wrecked my life i cant go out drinking or anything like that
8233320 i claim benefits and live on my own its been a long time since i had a girlfriend i manage the best i can
8233321 we do hear stories on a regular basis not only from people that use cannabis but also from concerned family and from concerned friends who can see somebody thats close to them someone they love who is going through a downward spiral
8233322 it can be very very difficult to watch so its not just the possible impact on the individual but also the broader impact as well that it might have on people they are close to
8233323 reclassification from a dealers point of view is just meaningless
8233324 it doesnt matter whether its class b or class c because the sentencing guidelines from the court are still the same
8233325 if you get caught you could get a maximum of 14 years on both so it doesnt really matter for a dealer because its the same penalties either way

8233334 strengthening research capacity in developing countries is one of the most effective and sustainable ways of advancing health and development in these countries and of helping correct the 10 90 gap in health research
8233335 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8233336 e vidence is consistent with the hypothesis that yaws is an heirloom disease in humans one caused by a pathogen that infected our anthropoid ancestors and has evolved with our species
8233337 harper et al have proposed that the syphilis treponeme has evolved more recently in history from new world yaws strains however further analysis by mulligan and colleagues is consistent with earlier reports which do not support an older origin of yaws but a relatively parallel evolution of the three subspecies
8233338 therefore we should exercise caution when interpreting biological observations from an evolutionary point of view
8233339 the last information on yaws was in 1990 since then there has not been any official notification of the disease we are currently working with the different regions to identify the remaining endemic countries and foci for targeted elimination efforts
8233340 unfortunately there are no certain data on the status of yaws in the americas the notification of new cases can be significantly underestimated in the absence of clinic screening and of evaluation of the latent form it is difficult to consider yaws as eliminated
8233341 the sporadic cases still recorded in guyana confirm the persistence of the latent form and thus given the high contagiousness of lesions the possibility of epidemic episodes if adequate surveillance is lacking
8233342 the failure to achieve complete eradication was due to multiple reasons notably the premature integration of yaws control activities into the general health services and the disappearance of support for yaws control
8233343 yaws programs have been deficient in failing to aggressively seek and contain yaws cases and contacts after mass treatment campaigns reduced yaws prevalence to low levels
8233344 t he continued occurrence of yaws and other endemic treponematoses despite availability of an effective stable and inexpensive treatment and a simple means of diagnosis in the field is lamentable testimony to lack of political will inadequate funding and persistent weakness in primary health care systems of affected countries
8233345 unfortunately yaws remains among the most neglected diseases and there is little global attention or focus on this disease although it primarily affects the most poor and vulnerable sections of the society the tribal or indigenous people living far away from mainstream
8233346 t he current status of knowledge of the extent of yaws is very poor
8233347 t he world health organization should publicize the currently known and unknown status of surveillance for this disease in each of the remaining suspected endemic countries and encourage mapping and more detailed reporting of surveillance data
8233348 some of the issues and challenges that have hampered yaws eradication historically include the lack of an effective mechanism for surveillance and case detection limited political commitment and resources limited capacity of general health staff to recognize and treat yaws ensuring drug supply and logistics management creating community awareness through appropriate advocacy iec information education and communication campaigns and extending the services to remote and hard to reach areas
8233349 yaws had been declared to be eliminated from india on sept 19 2006 as no case of the disease was reported since 2003 the new target set for yaws eradication from india is year 2008
8233350 the elimination has been achieved based on a two pronged strategy which primarily consisted of first active case finding and treatment of cases and prophylaxis of the household contacts using a single injection of long acting penicillin second community mobilisation the programme used a campaign approach health workers went village to village every six months looking for yaws cases and offering treatment prophylaxis to those needing it
8233351 the biannual independent appraisals of the activities under this program are also done and the last one was conducted in 2006 the sero surveillance activities in the selected districts in the children aged less than five years are also being done to ensure that the t p pertenue is not present in the community
8233352 indonesia has reported 6 461 cases during 2006 from 17 provinces with majority of cases coming from nusa tengarra timur papua west papua maluku and se sulawesi
8233353 these are also the areas which are more remote relatively inaccessible and less economically well off in timor leste the health care workers engaged in immunization campaigns have reported clinical yaws among 1 2 of children below five during 2003 2006
8233354 if additional modest funds become available we are hopeful that the target can be achieved within next five years in both indonesia and timor leste however this needs the enhanced collaboration and partnership with national and international partners
8233355 these are smaller geographical regions the total fund required for the activities would be small there is sufficient expertise available in the region these are the factors to facilitate early yaws eradication from these regions
8233356 we are motivated by indias experience but at the same time we also know the difficulties the elimination and eradication efforts entail
8233357 we have to adapt the strategies to different countries situations to make eradication efforts more easier we may also need to look at new technologies diagnostics and medicines to help achieve elimination and eventually eradication penicillin is still effective but we also need to research into new antibiotics particularly oral ones
8233358 treating the sick alone is not sufficient today there are more favorable opportunities to allow integration of yaws activities into the existing general health services
8233359 there is no international network on yaws eradication like you will find with polio and guinea worm we need to build the network and develop the necessary partnership for tackling yaws in a sustainable manner
8233360 clearly greater collaboration networking and resource mobilisation is required in order to achieve yaws eradication globally or even regionally
8233361 what seems most interesting about the renewed effort in south east asia is that it is aggressively targeting both cases and their contacts for which there seems to be evidence that this could overcome the earlier challenges
8233362 the disease is extremely amenable to eradication epidemiologically technologically historically and from political commitment point of view we believe also that efforts on yaws eradication could be an entry point for primary health care for the most marginalised populations
8233363 i strongly believe that yaws can still be eradicated from the world in the next five years
8233364 the fortunate thing for yaws is that we dont need whopping amount to realize our efforts the total amount of money required to achieve yaws eradication would be only a small fraction of what is being spent for polio eradication annually
8233365 i think that when polio eradication is being proven difficult achieving yaws eradication will be a big morale booster for the health workforce
8233366 ultimately eradication of another disease take for example that of smallpox in 1978 would by itself be an achievement for public health
8233367 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8233368 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8233369 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8233370 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8233371 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8233372 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8233373 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8233374 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8233375 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8233376 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8233377 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

8233420 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8233421 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible

8233425 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8233426 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8233427 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8233428 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8233429 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8233430 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8233431 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8233432 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8233433 who are open to doing something on the production side
8233434 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8233435 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8233436 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8233437 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8233448 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8233449 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8233450 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8233460 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8233461 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8233464 we want to make sure everyone realises that we are serious and intend to be around and ready whatever happens
8233465 whoever takes over the club they are going to need a local partnership we are here to stay and have people signed up to help and support the plans we have
8233466 we want to be around when the next roll of the dice comes and that could be very soon
8233467 we will be ready we have a data base of people willing to help and we could say we want 10 per cent now so lets talk
8233468 there is a long way to go but we believe we can have a genuine impact you cant score a goal if you are not on the pitch and we are certainly on the pitch as players
8233469 there is a strong probability that the affair will sort itself out before the end of the week
8233470 i m very satisfied with the behaviour of the team our objective was to get into the champions league and we have achieved it i m delighted with life
8233471 i am so happy the team is in the champions league we ve knocked out a good side
8233472 i ve seen so many ties of this type which have ended up being very difficult
8233473 what happened is we did not know whether to attack or defend the result we played thinking about the 4 0 in the first leg
8233474 it s clear that losing hurts but regarding this match there is no possible need to reproach anybody generally we played a good game
8233475 it was a somewhat strange game because we had a lot of chances but they scored the goal and we were not able to do anything
8233476 for the club the most important thing is that we are in the champions league
8233477 i wanted someone who already had experience of the top flight and who also had picked up good results

8233511 so we have a candidate who no sane political party would dare nominate a guy like this im not talking about anything other than he has no experience hes got no achievements but his associations with genuine america hating radicals occasionally cause him to say things that lead me to believe hes bought into a lot of what hes heard i think hes bought into it and i think he repeats it i think he is the formation of an indoctrination that has occurred to him his whole life and now he seeks the presidency
8233512 these associations and these ideas the lack of specificity from this guy all we have is what we know and what we know is not flattering so i think its imperative that all of these things be spoken so as you can be informed and people understand that this is not about image its not about hope its not about change its not about all these meaningless vapid nothings presidential elections matter greatly and this one does too if we end up with the wrong group of people running this country from the top down its going to take years to straighten it out and fix it

8234210 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
8234211 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
8234212 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
8234213 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
8234214 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup

8234226 i am incredibly proud of our faculty and their commitment to discovery and scholarship
8234227 more importantly we are about 35 million ahead of our strategic plan goal to achieve 540 million in research expenditures by 2012 this is partly the result of the investments that have been made in research over the past several years by the university and the commonwealth and partly due to the increased competitiveness of our faculty
8234228 the rise in rankings is the result of our 14 percent growth compared to an average increase in research and development expenditures at academic institutions of 3 5 percent last year
8234229 the statistics released last thursday by the national science foundation show that weve grown by over twice the national average in the last three years 11 percent versus 5 percent and just under twice the national average over the last five years 10 percent versus 6 percent
8234230 there is a high correlation between proposals and expenditure growth
8234231 of course that will change once the virginia tech carilion school of medicine is accredited
8234232 the dedication and hard work of students staff and faculty members made this ascent possible the ability to secure extramural funding will ensure that our programs continue and important contributions to basic and applied research are sustained

8234237 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8234238 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead

8234328 our strategic calculations show that if the zionist regime wants to make the smallest move against our interests either independently or with america in the shortest time all the territories under the zionist regimes control will become unsafe
8234329 that country is completely in the range of the islamic republics missiles the missile capabilities of our armed forces is such that the zionist regime with all its capabilities would not be able to confront it
8234330 the israelis know that if they take action against iran definitely the capabilities that the islamic world and especially the shiite world has in the region would deliver a hard blow to them
8234331 the presence of these forces enables iran to harm americas interests in different ways not even using its missile capability
8234332 bei uns geht es nahtlos weiter ich muss mir gedanken ber die zukunft machen jugendliche haben wettk mpfe die saisonplanung 2009 steht an da gibt es genug zu tun auch f r die athleten geht es weiter am 11 und 12 september stehen in potsdam die deutschen meisterschaften an danach kommt noch das weltcup finale
8234333 das wird sich haupts chlich auf lena sch neborn als olympiasiegerin konzentrieren und ich hoffe dass sich f r sie und damit auch unseren sport innerhalb der n chsten zwei wochen etwas tut bevor die aufmerksamkeit nach olympia wieder abklingt
8234334 das ist aktuell und in der au enwahrnehmung sicherlich auch so aber wir haben auch bei den m nnern gute athleten und zus tzlich auch noch einige junge sportler die in den n chsten jahren bestimmt gute leistungen bringen werden bei internationalen erfolgen k nnte dann die aufmerksamkeit f r die sportart insgesamt gr er werden
8234335 bisher ist sie mit leistungsdruck sehr gut klar gekommen hat sich auch aus einem tief wieder herausgearbeitet sie hat klare vorstellungen und hohe anspr che an sich h here wahrscheinlich als sie von au en kommen
8234336 der liegt in der vielseitigkeit es gibt unterschiedliche disziplinen mit unterschiedlichen anspr chen man braucht mal ausdauer mal geschicklichkeit mal schnelligkeit oder auch mal gef hl und das alles will dann auch entsprechend trainiert sein
8234337 nat rlich reicht es nicht dass man bei f nf disziplinen jede einmal trainiert man muss schon f nf sechs mal die woche laufen vier mal schwimmen sonst wird man nicht gut und es bleibt beim breitensport die sportler die das betreiben m ssen schon eine menge freizeit opfern sich gut organisieren das ist wie in anderen amateursportarten auch es braucht viel herzblut
8234338 viel dreht sich um information moderner f nfkampf ist f r den zuschauer anstrengender als andere sportarten nicht nur weil man vielleicht ein paar hundert meter zwischen den wettkampfst tten zur cklegen sondern auch weil man die wertung und einzelne athleten im auge behalten muss
8234339 das passiert auf mehreren ebenen bei der wm 2007 in berlin gab es ein rahmenprogramm das die zuschauer neben den wettk mpfen den ganzen tag begleitet hat so ein event kostet nat rlich geld hat der stimmung aber gut getan das andere sind regel nderungen zurzeit wird zum beispiel getestet ob man das laufen und schie en in einem wettbewerb vereinen kann
8234340 ich k nnte mir vorstellen dass es funktioniert aber es muss im richtigen modus passieren und professionell ausgetragen werden aber es kann auch nach hinten losgehen was ist wenn die nderungen den top athleten nicht liegen und die den sport verlassen au erdem muss so etwas technisch einwandfrei funktionieren luftpistolen sind extrem windanf llig dann landen die sch sse einmal statt auf der letzten auf der ersten scheibe und der zuschauer oder die medien denken hey was ist das denn f r ein kinderzirkus und dann ist die sportart ganz verloren
8234341 je pense quil y a un vrai communautarisme aussi chez les juifs

8234348 quem quer contar tudo no curr culo n o tem a chance de falar nada um erro achar que quanto maior for o documento melhor ele fica o tempo que voc tem para se apresentar ao selecionador de no m ximo dois minutos portanto duas folhas s o mais do que suficiente nada de tentar se enganar por exemplo ao diminuir o tamanho da fonte usada no documento o ideal ser conciso coloque no curr culo apenas as informa es teis e necess rias ou seja se voc fez um curso de culin ria e est em busca de uma vaga de secretariado oculte esse dado afinal n o vai fazer a m nima diferen a economize espa o para valorizar as caracter sticas mais relevantes para a vaga pretendida tenha bom senso
8234349 o curr culo deve ter as informa es m nimas necess rias para que o selecionador o conhe a quem l o curr culo n o tem bola de cristal alguns dados tais como local de forma o locais de trabalho datas de ingresso e sa da descri o de cargos e de atividades desempenhadas s o fundamentais e n o podem faltar as datas n o se resumem ao ano o ideal colocar pelo menos o m s evite usar abreviaturas e siglas para facilitar o entendimento do recrutador o documento deve real ar as realiza es pessoais de maneira clara organizada l gica e simples a objetividade passa credibilidade mas cuidado ser generalista pode ser interpretado como imaturidade
8234350 um dos pontos mais importantes de um curr culo o objetivo ele quem guia os caminhos do candidato e em alguns casos at os passos do selecionador o recrutador muitas vezes come a a leitura do curr culo pelo objetivo se ele estiver alinhado com a vaga prossegue a leitura caso contr rio j o descarta o objetivo deve ser constru do de maneira pensada estruturada clara e convincente para isso preciso saber realmente o que voc quer para a sua carreira profissional comece sempre com um verbo e nunca coloque a palavra almejo duas ou tr s linhas s o suficientes para descrever suas inten es profissionais apontar objetivos distintos pode demonstrar imaturidade e falta de foco
8234351 nunca insira dados relativos a documentos pessoais tais como cpf rg n mero da carteira de trabalho t tulo de eleitor ou de carteira de reservista essas informa es s o desnecess rias no processo de sele o al m do mais podem te trazer s rios transtornos os n meros dos documentos sigilosos podem cair na m o de pessoas erradas no topo do curr culo coloque apenas o nome completo idade nacionalidade estado civil endere o completo telefone n mero do celular e e mail lembre se de manter esses dados atualizados principalmente o n mero de telefone j que esse ser o meio de comunica o entre entrevistador e candidato indicar a pretens o salarial tamb m dispens vel coloque a apenas se solicitado esse um assunto confidencial que deve ser discutido no ato da entrevista pessoal
8234352 n o fa a do seu curr culo um cat logo de fotos lembre se n o a sua apar ncia que avaliada e sim os seus conhecimentos e experi ncias profissionais por isso evite colocar fotos legalmente as empresas s o proibidas de solicitar retratos dos seus candidatos j que se trata de uma a o discriminat ria mas se mesmo assim voc optar pela foto pense qual a imagem que eu quero passar para o recrutador tenha bom senso nada de figuras sem camisa de culos escuros ou de biqu ni escolha algo mais formal
8234353 a preocupa o excessiva com a est tica em alguns casos pode ser subentendida como compensa o de uma falha em contrapartida curr culos sujos e amassados demonstram que o candidato desorganizado o ideal optar por folhas brancas e tipologia tradicional tais como times new roman e arial negritos it licos e sublinhados s devem ser usados para organizar as informa es fugir do padr o s vezes agu a a curiosidade do recrutador por m importante identificar o tipo de empresa que faz a sele o se for uma institui o de perfil conservador siga o modelo padr o caso contr rio pode se inovar e usar a criatividade para se destacar no processo seletivo mas cuidado na d vida opte pela boa e velha folha branca
8234354 um curr culo se torna muito mais atraente aos olhos do selecionador se adequado ao perfil da empresa e da vaga pretendida para cada necessidade preciso uma reda o diferente as informa es podem ser as mesmas por m o ideal ressaltar as caracter sticas exigidas para o preenchimento da vaga se a sua experi ncia profissional for mais forte priorize a caso contr rio enfatize o lado do estudo o modelo do curr culo que tem que se adequar s suas necessidades e n o voc se pautar por um modelo padr o que n o vai te favorecer em nada a dica procure informa es sobre a empresa e fa a uma boa pesquisa sobre a rea em que gostaria de trabalhar para saber as informa es que devem ser ressaltadas no pr prio curr culo e que geralmente ser o as mais notadas pelo recrutador

8234356 we were demoing our game at leipzig this week where the new lara croft made an appearance wielding buns and guns and generally trying not to get molested by hordes of sweaty acne riddled east german teenagers she almost succeeded in the first pic she is still letting people get close to her and let them smell her hair it smells of cabbage and cheap fags it is not me in the pic the only real life video game character i would touch would be through a flying tackle she is definitely do able if a little short for a lara that night though things got more interesting
8234357 one colleague of mine who shall remain nameless lest he be mauled to death by his girlfriend was hanging about in his hotel room one evening when he heard womens voices in the hallway as any one of us would do he looked through the peephole and what does he see lara is getting into the hotel room across from him as you can see by the pics he used his iphone camera to snap pics of the poor girl through the looking hole before dropping his trousers and making meowing noises at the door i think you guys can appreciate the creepiness and down right terror these pictures will instil in people ms croft may even call the cops on this one
8234358 we suggested he should knock on the door wearing his bathrobe asking for a spare towel or directions to the sauna in the vague hope of some german style pornography ensuing but all he managed was to dreamily stare through the peek hole for a few hours before falling asleep anyway felt we had to send this one in hope you enjoy the perviness of it

8234398 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8234399 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8234400 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8234401 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8234402 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8234403 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8234404 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8234408 evaluarile noastre strategice arata ca daca regimul sionist singur sau impreuna cu statele unite lanseaza o actiune militara impotriva iranului intreagul israel va deveni vulnerabil in fata rachetelor iraniene pentru ca acestui stat ii lipseste profunzimea strategica
8234409 daca suntem atacati israelul stie ca va suferi lovituri fatale

8234411 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8234412 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8234413 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8234414 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8234415 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8234416 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8234417 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8234418 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8234419 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8234420 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8234421 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8234422 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8234423 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8234424 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8234425 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8234426 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8234427 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8234428 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8234429 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8234430 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8234431 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8234432 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8234433 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8234434 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8234435 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8234436 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8234437 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8234438 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8234439 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8234440 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8234441 no one works for someone we all just work together
8234442 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8234443 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8234444 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8234445 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8234446 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8234447 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8234448 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8234449 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8234450 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8234451 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8234452 was the opposite of the one that sen biden claimed i had made
8234453 but if any of these last two matters come up i will be your biggest defender
8234454 he was right about one thing i didnt believe him
8234455 i think hes dead flat wrong the fact of the matter is that there is that this idea of these security gains weve made have had no impact on the underlying sectarian dynamic none none whatsoever
8234456 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8234457 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8234458 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8234459 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8234460 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8234461 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8234462 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8234463 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8234464 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8234465 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8234466 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8234467 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8234468 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8234469 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8234470 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8234471 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8234472 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8234473 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8234474 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
8234475 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
8234476 this is a planning took where all things are going
8234477 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8234478 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8234479 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8234480 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8234481 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8234482 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8234483 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8234484 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8234485 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

8234517 there was panic among people a rare thing in my memory here people were just trying to get out any way they could to escape floodwaters
8234518 the government should rescue us we are poor and have no means of survival
8234519 our goodwill to keep turkeys eu path open is not without limit
8234520 if we see that turkey is not being positive or constructive in its stance at a time when a new phase in finding a cyprus solution has begun then we should reconsider our general policy towards turkeys eu accession
8234521 above all lets not forget that turkeys european prospects depend on cypruss consent because from time to time this is forgotten especially by our european partners
8234522 from 2004 cyprus has continually accepted turkeys accession course but weve seen absolutely no goodwill gesture from the turkish side either towards the cyprus republic or its eu obligations towards cyprus
8234523 its just a reward its like all the unexpected hard work paid off this just proves that the guys keep these cars in fantastic shape as drivers we didnt know the difference between the cars
8234524 when you lose 35 points in one race it makes it a lot easier for him to come back
8234525 what a guy i fall in love easy and i just found another one the guys did a great job to not make me feel any difference
8234526 this shows the determination of the group we have and the depth of the team
8234527 for those guys to do such a good job that we qualify first and second and finish first and second is amazing it wasnt as easy as i wanted it to be but it worked out in the end
8234528 the good news is i never put a wheel off the asphalt i never locked wheels i was just pushing it was an interesting situation it paid off and it was a lot of fun sometimes conserving fuel is the worst thing to do we didnt conserve fuel at all we just kept pushing
8234529 i mean racing is about going fast not going slow obviously you do whatever you can to finish on the podium but people are telling you on the radio that you have to hit a certain fuel number drive slow but be fast dont get passed it doesnt make any sense

8234532 0 day and the first security alert for 3 years from oracle
8234533 please share your point of view about oracle security at this moment in my opinion i see less oracle security vulnerabilites in the newer oracle version and less persons researching about oracle security because oracle is good now oracle security getting better by time so no need to care about oracle security anymore its right
8234534 you have to ask yourself why do security leaks occur in oracle databases because of passwords on privileged accounts that lack complexity and which are never changed because an application with sql injection leaks connects to the database with an over privileged account because the dba thought it kinda easier to grant every object privilege to public because the database runs an old version that is never updated nor cpus are applied because you should never change a running system etc etc or because oracle has a vulnerability in the dbms obscurity package that allows to shutdown the database in certain occasions on certain platforms im betting that most organisations suffer more from problems like the first four many variations exist so oracle isnt per definition secure after applying the latest patch a lot depends on work done by the dba and developers http www oracle com technology pub articles project lockdown index html for a better start towards oracle security
8234535 agree with you that most vulnerabilities listed existing in the production database we can clasify the oracle vuls by two type 1 oracle software vuls weak pl sql packages update lastest patch can solved this less vuls in oracle 10 2 0 3 and 11g and will be near zero in the next release hope this 2 misusing of oracle database weak password configurations coding good dba or developer can solved this partly not all but in my expierience customer who using oracle product just pay attention in oracle security when they see more vulnerabilites in oracle software seem they really not care much about misusing of oracle database one thing that cause me thinking that oracle is good enough at this time and future is not see more public vulns or frequently posted news in david alex or pete blog during several months
8234536 nice post and answer by marcel jan i think that there are two answers to this point vpv the first is that the database software itself is getting better with later versions in regards to vulnerabilities etc thats fine and is commendable for oracle

8234538 last year our ratio of investments in asia to investments outside of asia was approximately 2 to 1 i expect this statistic to be volatile over time as we do not target that number from a management perspective we want to be available and capable of executing high quality investments that we believe to have excellent value no matter where they are in the world if they happen to be outside of asia one year so be it if not we will invest where we see the best value
8234539 we thought it would be a third a third a third over time as new opportunities come up in different parts of the globe that might change as of right now we are quite satisfied with where that stands
8234540 in emerging markets like asia we see its growth as a proxy of economic growth especially in china india and indonesia
8234541 we are concerned with the emerging risks of stagflation opportunities may be limited in such a scenario

8234557 yang penting saat ini adalah bagaimana kita mengawal dan menjalankan kebijakan itu dengan baik sehingga tidak disalahgunakan
8234558 saya minta agar kalangan organisasi profesi lebih kritis terhadap masuknya dokter dokter asing ke indonesia kalau perlu memprotes kepada saya jika ada kebijakan pemerintah yang dinilai merugikan dokter indonesia
8234559 kita memerlukan dokter dalam jumlah cukup banyak agar disebarkan ke seluruh penjuru negara kita sehingga rakyat di daerah terpencil dapat juga merasakan pelayanan kedokteran sehingga tidak ada alasan untuk memasukkan dokter asing

8234593 im kidding of course ive always said that im happy at milan and as long as i have the same objectives as milan ill stay here
8234594 thats the way its always been my aim is to win and thats the same with milan as you can see by the effort theyve made in that direction strengthening the squad in such a way that this will always be a team of winners
8234595 people say were not interested in winning the uefa cup this group has won everything we could possibly win
8234596 our main aim is to win the scudetto i think inter milan will be the team to beat given what theyve done these last few years
8234597 and then theres always as roma who are a team that play great football these will be our rivals throughout the season but there are always surprises
8234598 fiorentina are a team that have been playing together for some time now and last season they had a great year and they could repeat that
8234599 and then well see if there are any other surprise packages

8234616 my job is to get the defense to play hard to get the most out of them thats all on me it always has been so i remember looking at my mom right after she said that to me
8234617 this was my mom my family telling me my players didnt play very hard it hit home i told myself that from that day forward whatever we do we can play with effort and we can play with physical and mental toughness regardless if we execute i tell the players all the time that the effort is on you and the execution is on me
8234618 we have really adapted to it were taking it full steam ahead coach he demands excellence and we have to get there we have to meet him with his enthusiasm and everything in his coaching ability because he comes hard
8234619 im not proud of that moment and ive stopped swearing since then well im working on not swearing
8234620 seriously im not proud of it how do you go home and explain that to your 6 year old
8234621 my dad used to always tell me that 10 percent of life is what happens to you
8234622 the other 90 percent is what you do with it you can break your leg and have the woe is me poor me attitude about life or you can roll up your sleeves put on a hard hat and go to work you can adjust adapt and move on i always choose to move on
8234623 it was just another setback another thing to work through so i did
8234624 he intercepted the ball and ended up fumbling on the play
8234625 it actually was todd helton who plays for the colorado rockies now people dont remember but he was the tennessee quarterback before manning but yes i did fumble
8234626 i didnt have as much experience as the other coaches i was going against but i knew i could outwork everybody
8234627 i just figured that coaching was all about working hard preparing and relating to people thats really what this business is about relating to your players
8234628 i mean he was about the same age as me and never had coached in the nfl i was really surprised because i would have run through a brick wall for him after about a week hes got this infectious personality hes intense but hes also honest and sincere and you just dont want to disappoint him
8234629 both my parents died months apart from each other when i was there and coach muschamp was the one i turned to to help me through everything hes going to succeed at texas his passion becomes your passion his intensity becomes your intensity
8234630 there is an intensity there thats hard to describe but its there because of muschamp
8234631 han gjorde s nt man inte ska p en inspelning
8234632 this show isnt fun anymore especially after you know how it was made
8234633 its a real concern theyre very talented and very much like the group we just lost to the nfl two years ago and we played them as redshirted freshmen the michael huffs and the cedric griffins and michael griffin was a true freshman but were back to that again we had some growing pains so were going to need some help back there
8234634 you know the goal i set for myself this year was to have a healthy training camp
8234635 ive got to do a good job of being a good leader and bringing the younger guys along
8234636 i think youve got to approach each game the same and go out and play the game and do the best you can do to help the team win part of that includes helping the younger guys and bringing them along
8234637 he makes all the calls he is the quarterback of the offensive line and does a great job
8234638 nowadays defenses are made up of a bunch of guys who can move pretty well and are not that big if somebody wanted to line up and pound the ball i think theyd have a chance to have a little bit of success
8234639 we can still run the football plus have the flexibility of better passing its the best of both worlds
8234640 i hope not i dont want to have to face it
8234641 last year we hit the 500 000 mark in prize money at the gold cup festival for the first time so to jump over 100 000 in a year is a very significant rise
8234642 we have attracted an early entry of 171 horses for the john smiths ayr gold cup with around 25 of them rated 100 or higher so there is no doubt that top prizes attract top horses
8234643 the doonside cup also benefited last year from a cash boost and we saw a race featuring some outstanding horses with anna pavlova winning i think we are in for another treat this year
8234644 one of the things you have when a new coach is coming in is you have to be careful that you dont have a lot of conversation on the headsets when somebody is trying to call a play
8234645 we actually worked on conversation nobody talks while theyre calling the defense or the offense unless theres a question or i have something to ask them
8234646 hes a true leader and really intelligent like kosar was he makes the right reads and the right throws and we trust him with audibles one of the reasons its so easy for us to have a quarterback under center is we trust smith to make the right call
8234647 no i think its time that we got out there and played somebody else
8234648 to me it means you have to be consistently good and then you have to look back and thats when you say you were a great team
8234649 we havent played as consistently well as weve wanted to the last two years
8234650 a couple of times we didnt get started and it looked like we were starting in a daze
8234651 you should go play because you like to play and because youre the university of texas
8234652 hell give you about 10 new plays every package and youd better learn them now not tomorrow
8234653 and wed go straight from relaxed stretching to 3 on 3 drills where you make the tackle or blow em off the ball coach muschamp has a lot of expectations people are more afraid to make him mad than they are to make 100 000 people mad
8234654 that was our team saying when we won the national championship

8234656 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8234657 its just surprising to me to even see a depth chart
8234658 as we continue to look at our depth chart the most important thing we do is to make sure we get the right players on the field and then figure out what we feature with each one of them
8234659 es gibt noch einige dinge die wir mit dem afrikanischen handlungsrahmen machen wollen und ich denke es ist schon sicher dass wir da weiter in diese richtung arbeiten werden

8234661 wenn wir wollen dass das n chste spiel im wald von s damerika spielt k nnten wir es tun
8234662 aber ich denke die zeitersparnis war f r uns einer der gr nde warum wir das afrika setting w hlten wir f hlten dass ein exotischer und gef hrlicher schauplatz den die meisten leute wahrscheinlich noch nie selbst erlebt oder ausf hrlich in film fernsehen und anderen spielen gesehen haben den wert der far cry marke bewahrt deswegen wollten wir afrika nehmen

8234668 before we had ultracaps to provide astonishingly high values of capacitance we had electrolytics
8234669 one of the phenomena that happens inside electrolytics is the charge accumulation and charge separation that occurs at the interface when any electrode is immersed in an electrolyte solution
8234670 to understand ultracaps stop thinking about flat plates or flat plates rolled up into tubes with a dielectric between them much like peanut butter in a sandwich
8234671 the helmholtz layers give rise to an effect called double layer capacitance
8234672 the helmholtz region capacitance depends on the area of those porous carbon electrodes and the size of the ions in solution
8234673 batteries and ultracapacitors are often lumped together obscuring a number of important differences
8234674 the most basic applications for ultracaps lie in stabilising dc bus voltages ultracaps have become widely used in automobiles to protect the various engine control units and other microcontrollers from voltage dips associated with the application of sudden transient loads
8234675 elsewhere in transportation the ultracaps ability to absorb and discharge energy rapidly makes it far better than batteries for regenerative braking schemes
8234676 in hybrid transportation applications in the u s ise corporations buses now run in elk grove and long beach the buses accelerate more quickly than standard buses at gross vehicle weight the bus can accelerate from zero to 31 mph in 17 seconds and can reach a maximum speed of 100 km per hour preliminary data indicates better average fuel efficiency compared to competitive battery based hybrid electric drive systems

8234682 parasitical organization that latches onto events around world and through them gives itself strength
8234683 the best way to prevent this is to keep the leaders concerned about their own security and to keep them pinned down in the remote areas of the afghan pakistan border and allow them to suffer the fate of all other outsiders who have attempted to establish themselves in the region

8234686 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8234687 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8234688 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8234689 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8234690 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8234691 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8234692 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8234693 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8234694 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8234695 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8234696 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8234697 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8234698 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8234699 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8234700 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8234701 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8234702 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8234703 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8234704 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8234705 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8234706 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8234707 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8234708 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8234709 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8234710 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8234711 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8234712 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8234713 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8234714 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8234715 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8234716 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti
8234717 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8234718 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8234719 quando sono state appiccate le fiamme i bambini non si trovavano nelledificio solo la donna si trovava in una delle due camere incendiate ed rimasta ustionata nel tentativo di scappare

8234723 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8234724 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8234725 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8234726 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8234727 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8234728 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8234729 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi
8234730 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8234731 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8234732 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8234733 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8234734 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8234735 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8234736 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia
8234737 il primo impegno della futura amministrazione americana devessere quello di un lavoro comune
8234738 mettiamoci nei panni russi conclude casini ma anche nei nostri
8234739 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8234740 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8234741 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8234742 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8234743 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8234744 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8234745 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8234746 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8234747 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8234748 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8234749 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8234750 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8234751 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8234752 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8234753 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8234754 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8234755 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8234756 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8234757 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8234758 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8234759 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8234760 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8234761 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8234762 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8234763 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8234764 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8234765 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8234766 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8234767 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8234768 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8234769 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8234770 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8234771 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8234772 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8234773 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8234774 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8234775 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8234776 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8234777 night view assist debuted on the s class in 2006
8234778 what we like about it is it is infrared based its more active than the heat based versions
8234779 its impossible to drive looking simply at the two dimensional night view display
8234780 and because the screen isnt in your direct field of view its difficult to monitor it while driving
8234781 in order to get to the mass market it has to enhance the driving experience
8234782 it has to make it easier to drive give you valuable information to make driving the vehicle easier or enhance the info tainment value of the driving experience
8234783 could potentially reduce the incidence of rear end crashes and harm caused by tailgating behavior
8234784 its one of those features that has a lot more appeal than night vision thats for sure
8234785 i love mine i use it almost every day unless i get into a traffic jam but if i am in medium or normal traffic i use it and pretty much i dont have to hit the brake until i get off the off ramp
8234786 blind spot detection in our research actually garners higher levels of interest than enhanced cruise control
8234787 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8234788 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8234789 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8234790 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8234791 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8234792 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8234793 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8234794 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8234804 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8234805 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8234806 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8234807 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8234808 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8234809 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8234810 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8234811 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8234812 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8234813 f r uns ist afrika noch immer sehr viel versprechend es gibt noch viele dinge die wir in afrika machen wollen und ich denke man kann mit sicherheit sagen dass wir afrika weiterhin erforschen wollen abgesehen davon k nnten wir auch etwas neues und verlockendes f r das antarktis setting finden dies k nnte der dreh und angelpunkt unseres n chsten spiels sein aber ehrlich gesagt sind wir noch immer in der vorbereitungsphase

8234859 means of escapism and relief are working woefully towards our restlessness discontent shame and ultimate misery in all that they commend as acceptable ambition and behaviour it is particularly in the realm of entertainment and art that the corruption of the human imagination is honoured and worshipped humour that delightful means of taking odd angles on life and relieving tension has become crude and cruel meagre talent is considered praiseworthy triviality tops the headlines and bad taste in our overblown appetite for amusement attracts big budgets and big audiences we report but cannot appreciate the dangers in the events trends and circumstances that impinge upon us disaster and crisis repeatedly dominate the news bulletins but we are indifferent to the causes and warnings that should generate serious heart searching the writings of israels prophets ought to sharpen our insight and arouse our alarm at the conditions of our times that parallel those described in biblical history gods perspective but a sound critique from the church is not forthcoming because the world provides the pattern for our life and message we have been seduced and sedated by the world merging with its preferences and values on a tidal flow we have failed to feel or observe not realizing that we are perilously adrift as divine restraints noticeably recede we are disturbed first of all as to what man can imagine and dare to suggest and then subsequently in his recklessness undertake to perform culturally scientifically and politically it is not difficult to concur with the divine verdict expressed at the time of the deluge the lord saw how great man s wickedness on the earth had become and that every inclination of the thoughts imagination of his heart was only evil all the time

8234911 i really liked the campus and the coaches and players were great
8234912 were not sleeping on those guys theyre a great football club and weve broken down the film on them they have great receivers and great defensive backs a good offensive line and a great quarterback

8234923 that country is completely in the range of the islamic republics missiles the missile capabilities of our armed forces is such that the zionist regime with all its capabilities would not be able to confront it
8234924 the israelis know that if they take action against iran definitely the capabilities that the islamic world and especially the shiite world has in the region would deliver a hard blow to them
8234925 the presence of these forces enables iran to harm americas interests in different ways not even using its missile capability

8234936 sorpr n que el govern torni de vacances i no dediqui ni un minut de la seva reuni a parlar del problema que parla i ha parlat tothom durant aquest estiu que s la crisi econ mica
8234937 en un moment que es fan expedients concursals expedients de regulaci que el creixement s del 0 1 i que hi ha un atur galopant en una poca on normalment lartur baixa i puja locupaci no sestigui fent front amb coratge el principal problema del pa s que s la crisi econ mica
8234938 hagu s estat oport que en la reuni dahir haguessin fet un balan de com estan totes les mesures que van anunciar com estan les mesures destalvi les de contenci de la despesa les de suport a leconomia productiva
8234939 hagu s hagut de fer amb el que realment ha fet
8234940 han fet un projecte de llei que tal i com diu ugt i nosaltres tamb s poc ambici s gens concret i sha fet sense que estigui enllestit el pacte nacional dinnovaci i recerca
8234941 el govern podria parlar i preocupar se per la liquidesa del sector financer per en canvi tira endavant el decret de caixes que s un vestit a mida
8234942 al psc intervenir en els rgans de direcci de les caixes

8234946 i thought well its an annoyance but its not really hampering our work
8234947 and it was clear they werent upset about something in general they were upset with me
8234948 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
8234949 unfortunately the strike impacted the show when we were hitting our stride creatively and really building momentum
8234950 but while we were on the picket line we discussed a lot about where we wanted the show to go the time off allowed us to reflect and come out of the gate really focused on making a better show
8234951 its a tough show to act perform write and shoot
8234952 its an ambitious show fortunately there arent other action comedy dramas in our time slot thats definitely one of the strongest things going for us were different
8234953 the last episode that was aired really wasnt a finale it didnt tie up anything so were starting fresh in many ways hopefully well be able to have a full 22 shows
8234954 romance is something were really owning and putting at the forefront of the show
8234955 zach and yvonne have great chemistry theyre terrific in romantic scenes we always knew there was going to be that romantic yearning but we want to go after that in a really significant way
8234956 i am and always have been passionate to the point of being anti social about science in general and artificial intelligence robotics and cognitive science in particular
8234957 youre right of course and strangely attractive too i notice
8234958 specific findings aside id like to start with the fact that science is important hugely all pervasively important
8234959 i should think not im not sure what proportion of the ft audience suffers from method blindness but the ft has extremely good science coverage so the readers have plenty of scientific roughage in their diet i hope to be turning out 400 800 word stories about topics of scientific interest you may have noticed that i have a tendency to be somewhat unnecessarily circumlocutory one might almost say i verge on the prolix from time to time if one could get a word in edgeways one might anyway the discipline will be extremely good for me telling people what is known what is contentious how we know the difference and why its interesting all on the back of a fag packet so the next time someone asks me why robots doing science is cool i will be able to give them an answer in 400 words or less

8235146 este logro por parte del lhcb velo reconstruyendo los primeros rastros del lhc es un indicar de la dedicaci n y duro trabajo del equipo de cient ficos quienes han trabajado en este detector durante m s de una d cada
8235147 un equipo de cient ficos pudo ver las part culas durante unos segundos y desde la primera colisi n esto deja una buena posici n para futuras operaciones del experimento que exploren las diferencias de comportamiento de materia y antimateria
8235148 nos hemos estado preparado toda la semana para esta primera opci n de ver los rastros para ver estas part culas tuvimos que configurar la electr nica para tomar los datos justo en el momento adecuado y tuvimos un acierto dentro de 25 mil millon simas de segundo
8235149 hab a trabajado en los puntos de monitorizaci n en tiempo real que nos permitieron ver las part culas atravesando el detector qued sobrecogido cuando vi las evidencias de los rastros de part culas apareciendo con claridad en los monitores del ordenador en la sala central

8235155 estas simulaciones muestran que las estrellas j venes pueden formarse en la vecindad de los agujeros negros supermasivos siempre que exista un suministro razonable de nubes de gas desde el exterior de la galaxia
8235156 el elemento crucial fue el modelado del calentamiento y enfriamiento del gas dado que nos dec a cu nta masa es necesaria por parte del gas para tener la suficiente gravedad como para superar la propia presi n del gas y por tanto formar una estrella el calor est causado por la extrema compresi n de la nube conforme se estira y desgarra por el tir n del agujero negro esto se equilibra con el enfriamiento el cual requiere un conocimiento detallado de c mo de r pido escapa la radiaci n de la nube

8235205 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8235206 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8235207 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8235208 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8235209 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8235210 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8235211 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8235212 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8235213 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8235214 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8235215 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8235216 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8235217 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8235218 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8235219 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8235220 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8235221 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8235222 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8235223 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8235224 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8235225 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8235226 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8235227 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8235228 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8235229 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8235230 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8235231 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8235232 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8235233 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8235234 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8235235 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8235236 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8235237 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8235238 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

8235289 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8235290 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8235291 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8235292 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8235293 she did the promo for them but there never were any plans for her to appear on the show
8235294 the european commission joins with the french presidency in strongly condemning the decision by the russian authorities to recognise the independence of these two regions
8235295 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8235296 lots of people are leaving here wishing it was hillary but no one is leaving here with any impression that she is not supporting him so it is a good moment but a little melancholy for those of us who love hillary
8235297 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8235298 the fact that the plane was kidnapped from darfur indicates that one of the militant groups may have prepared for this operation and the fact that they want to go to france adds more to that theory
8235299 the hijackers dont have any clear demands except for fuel and then heading to france
8235300 the demand for tickets was just immense all the ticket sites slowed down severely but nothing crashed and the system worked very smoothly we want to thank the fans for their patience and look forward to seeing you all at the shows
8235301 i have bruises all over my legs thats from wearing leggings im jumping off of the monitors and doing scissor kicks or trying to keep up with these boys its funny

8235303 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying out some new material i dont know what it will be but it will be something at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
8235304 when i get in the studio i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing

8235309 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8235310 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8235311 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8235312 i do not even want to talk about losing him he is absolutely top notch one that fabio capello should have a serious look at once you have played 30 games for the under 21s you deserve a crack at the big time

8235330 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8235331 im going to assume from her remark that she had a fundamental misunderstanding of the catholic opposition to abortion as a fundamental teaching of the church
8235332 i hope she understands this is not an historical controversy recently settled but a long standing fundamental teaching of the catholic church that abortion is inherently immoral and perhaps it will help open her heart
8235333 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8235334 the entire corporation mourns the loss of morris dunkel we were very fortunate to have him as part of the epolin board of directors
8235335 during the corporations early years morris was a major force in developing the technology and providing the basic structure which ultimately led to the growth of epolin his mentoring and friendship will not easily be replaced on behalf of all of our employees and the board of directors i extend our deepest sympathy to his wife marilyn and the entire family
8235336 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8235337 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8235338 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8235339 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8235340 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8235341 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8235342 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8235343 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8235344 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8235345 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8235354 i committed myself to stay on it for 90 120 days
8235355 because i know it took time for my body to get to this point so i expected it to take time for the stemenhance to help me
8235356 i was working one day with both hands over my head and i suddenly realized what i was doing both arms were back to normal
8235357 ive changed nothing else not my diet or lifestyle and i feel just great thanks to stemenhance whats more ive lost fifteen pounds that i didnt need
8235358 i was thrilled to have the opportunity to name this cell
8235359 i can demostrate for them that everyone can benefit from stemenhance and there are no side effects
8235360 i enjoy teaching people about the way cells degenerate in the body over time and how stemenhance helps to increase the number of circulating stem cells
8235361 kids rebound fast because they have more active stem cells adults rebound more and more slowly as their number of stem cells diminishes with stemenhance we can help stem the tide of time

8235364 allah has ordained that any man who engages himself in the recitation of glorious quran so constantly that he finds no time to send prayers to me i shall provide him more without asking than those who ask
8235365 the servant gets nearest to allah by means of reciting the glorious quran
8235366 the man who has studied the glorious quran and recites it daily can be likened to a basket full of musk whose sweet smell is making the whole atmosphere fragrant and the man who has studied the glorious quran but does not recite it may be likened to a bottle full of musk whose mouth has been sealed with a stopper
8235367 these are the words of my creator and glorious lord
8235368 i consider it far better to recite small surahs like and al qadr with understanding and care than to read through the longer surahs of al baqarah and ale imran at a rapid pace without careful understanding of the meanings of the words

8235394 recite the quraan for indeed it will come on the day of judgement as an intercessor for its ashaab those who read memorize and implement it
8235395 i heard the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alaihi wasallam say the quraan will be brought on the day of judgement as well as the people who used to act upon it
8235396 the fast and the quraan will intercede for the servant on the day of judgement the fast will say my lord i restricted him from food and drink so allow me to intercede for him and the quraan will say i prevented him from sleeping at night so allow me to intercede for him so they will be allowed to intercede
8235397 the forbiddance of reciting the quraan in less than three days as stated in a hadeeth has only been mentioned in regards to its being done on a normal basis as for the specific times that are virtuous such as the month of ramadaan and especially the nights in which the night of al qadr is sought or those places that are virtuous such as makkah for the one who enters it without residing there then it is recommended to recite the quraan a lot in these times and places seeking the merits connected with their time and place this is the opinion of ahmad abu ishaaq and other scholars and the actions of others indicate that as has been stated previously

8235422 zi takes intellectual property rights seriously and has no reason to believe that it infringes any patent claims of nuance this suit in conjunction with the motion of contempt filed by nuance on august 19 2008 against zi represents a questionable course of action by nuance in light of its failed proposal to acquire zi at a low valuation on august 14 2008 the timing of these motions raises serious questions as to the real motivation of these claims and we remain disappointed that nuance is resorting to these tactics to acquire zi without recognizing its full value we will vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation proceeding and continue to examine all legal remedies available to us with respect to nuances tactics

8235436 i carry that stench on my back ever since the day it happened
8235437 i was a day boy and i was not the only victim back then
8235438 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8235439 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8235440 all i can say is that the nsw police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble free as possible
8235441 i can confirm that theres no one at the school at the moment that is subject to that inquiry
8235442 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8235443 it still doesnt take away the unfortunate reality of human nature

8235445 she said that she had her there and was trying to get the other kids out as well and just somehow lost her in the panic with the other kids
8235446 she went back to get her out and could hear her inside but she just couldnt get in
8235447 it started in the loungeroom on one side of the house and it just took the rest of it within two minutes
8235448 we got our hose but there was nowhere to plug it in to there was a few people out there but there was nothing we could do
8235449 there was a man trying to get back in because there was a girl lost in there
8235450 there were initially five children ranging from two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8235451 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out

8235560 it was a fantastic way to end the fringe this year has been mired with quite a bit of controversy and to echo david odohertys sentiments comedians want to come to edinburgh and make people laugh
8235561 the spirit of the comedy fringe are the comedians end of story
8235562 far from looking like a magnanimous celebration of the comics it actually looked like the panel were saying to be honest no one epitomised the spirit of the fringe this year so were just going to give it to you all
8235563 in a year where there were fewer shows nominated than usual which already gave out the signal that the panel thought there were only seven shows in the whole fringe good enough to be on the list it only felt like a bit of a kick in the teeth that they couldnt think of anyone to give the prize to

8235578 our strategic calculations show that if the zionist regime wants to make the smallest move against our interests either independently or with america in the shortest time all the territories under the zionist regimes control will become unsafe
8235579 that country is completely in the range of the islamic republics missiles the missile capabilities of our armed forces is such that the zionist regime with all its capabilities would not be able to confront it
8235580 the israelis know that if they take action against iran definitely the capabilities that the islamic world and especially the shiite world has in the region would deliver a hard blow to them

8235583 the law overhauls our nations higher education law and removes obstacles that make it harder for qualified students to go to college

8235599 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8235600 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8235601 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8235602 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8235603 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8235604 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8235605 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8235606 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8235607 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8235608 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8235609 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8235610 pensamos que la vpo es lo nico que puede admitir actualmente el mercado
8235611 que la vpo vaya a ser o no soluci n a la crisis depende de que las entidades concedan financiaci n para este tipo de viviendas a sus promotores pero tambi n a sus compradores
8235612 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8235613 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8235614 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8235615 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8235616 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8235617 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8235618 siamo daccordo dovremmo parlare un po di inglese riconosce la sud coreana se ri pak quando si vince si dovrebbe tenere un discorso in inglese invece quello che viene fuori in genere soprattutto tensione una lingua diversa davanti alle telecamere in quei momenti c molta emozione

8235624 just to be able to walk in the shoes of somebody as great at donovin darius do the things that he did for this program

8235626 back there in the secondary thats critical sometimes we can get fooled by physical skills but it goes beyond that
8235627 coachs offensive plan is for me to find the open space get the ball in my hands and then let me go and run
8235628 obviously its one of the best opportunities right now for any goalkeeper anywhere
8235629 theres a lot to compare to hes going to be looking for things in me hes been training national team goalkeepers
8235630 with the information he can provide to her i feel like its endless
8235631 itll be whatever she can take in and contribute its going to take a lot of hard work but she has a great work ethic the opportunity for her itll be endless
8235632 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
8235633 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8235634 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8235635 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8235636 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8235637 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8235638 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8235639 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8235640 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8235641 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8235642 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8235643 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8235644 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8235645 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8235646 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8235647 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8235648 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8235649 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8235650 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8235651 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8235652 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8235653 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
8235654 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
8235655 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8235656 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8235657 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8235658 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8235659 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
8235660 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
8235661 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8235666 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8235667 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8235668 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8235669 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8235684 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8235685 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8235686 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8235687 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8235688 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8235689 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8235708 weve had it 10 12 years now thats when it started getting big in the league
8235709 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8235710 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8235711 but i have my own system i get some hot tea and cold water
8235712 if you get a little tired you splash some on your face
8235713 you always have the challenge as a coach to make sure they dont get bored
8235714 a lot of times ill put new packages in just because of that but sometimes you have to give them a break during the meetings
8235715 yeah weve seen a few guys go to sleep especially the rookies
8235716 a lot of times rookies myself included think well be done by noon and have the rest of the day to hang out but its like a regular day at work youll see a coach call out a guy when hes sleeping hey you see this you see this guy and theyre still knocked out
8235717 i try to bring a little juice and creativity to the presentation
8235718 we dont have many problems at all except sometimes with a veteran who has heard that particular play for the 300th time
8235719 hell tell us to stand up but he pretty much understands he knows the meetings get long and its hard to stay awake hell joke about it sometimes
8235720 its not so much the physical part of it as it is the execution part of it you have to learn the defense youre playing against from an offensive standpoint and then you have to learn the blocking schemes and the routes on wednesday youre doing your base game plan its your first and second down stuff
8235721 a lot of it is on his shoulders for wednesday on how the offense goes
8235722 i have the same mind set as the coaches going into the wednesday morning meeting
8235723 as were in the meeting ill highlight different things i think we should emphasize the main purpose of the meeting is for the offensive line and running backs to find out what running plays we want to attack them with and for the receivers to find out what depth they should run their routes and how the defense may play them im looking at how the cornerbacks play and trying to figure out their weaknesses and strengths
8235724 i look at the other teams roster to find out if there are any syracuse players on the team
8235725 it has been kind of low lately i really do that every wednesday
8235726 i usually go through the personnel of the opponent coming up and some of the key things we have to stop
8235727 then we talk about the game plan and i show them a little bit of film of the opponent its definitely one of the most important days
8235728 we have 16 to 20 plays in the walk through
8235729 those are all the new plays shifts formations and motions anything that is new
8235730 if your quarterback doesnt feel good about it you get rid of the play
8235731 you get 150 plays in your game plan and youre going to run 60 of those if our quarterback doesnt feel good about it its gone you dont have to ask the quarterback because you can see it our guy is very competitive so he wants to do them all but if i dont like the way it looks im not going to do it
8235732 they do a good job of reminding us of that there have been times when we had a big win and we come back on wednesday and were looking like crap theyll let us know we might go with pads the next day just to send us a message
8235733 sometimes you have to have patience at the wednesday practice knowing that you put something new in and it might take them a day to learn it
8235734 by friday i want to make sure we have eliminated those mistakes were always putting a new pressure package in every week
8235735 thats the time for the position coaches to get with their players watch some film and get an idea of the guy theyre going against those meetings usually last about an hour
8235736 after the position meetings we come up and look at practice on film and then we start getting ready for the next days practice
8235737 usually im able to leave around 9 30 or 10 oclock a lot of times its a 16 hour day because you just want to make sure you cover everything

8235758 hypertension may be the silent killer but obesity is the ignored disease the time to address it is now
8235759 this is a very important development it signals recognition by canadas medical community of the importance of tackling the issue of obesity in canada
8235760 the canadian obesity network and its members look forward to working with canadas medical community to address the devastating consequences of this disease and we applaud the wisdom of the cma general council
8235761 obesity is now recognized as a chronic disease that needs to be dealt with through a coordinated national approach
8235762 canadian research conducted in 2007 found that only 14 of physicians were addressing the problem of obesity in their practices so clearly we as health providers need to do a better job treating our overweight and obese patients
8235763 the canadian obesity network is ideally situated to help the medical community by providing tools and learning opportunities based on the latest available scientific evidence that physicians need to effectively prevent and treat obesity the cmas resolution is a call to action to address this important issue

8236307 the mattress of the prophet on which he slept was made of leather stuffed with the fiber of the date palm tree
8236308 if you want money we will collect enough money for you so that you will be the richest one of us if you want leadership we will take you as our leader and never decide on any matter without your approval if you want a kingdom we will crown you king over us
8236309 do not let your hatred of a people incite you to aggression
8236310 and do not let ill will towards any folk incite you so that you swerve from dealing justly be just that is nearest to heedfulness
8236311 he is not a perfect believer who goes to bed full and knows that his neighbor is hungry
8236312 show mercy to people on earth so that all h will have mercy on you in heaven
8236313 it is a sunnah but the point is that it must be done appropriately
8236314 i admire a man who is like a child with his family playful and once he leaves them he is more serious
8236315 zayd ibn thabit was one of the most humorous men in his home outside of his home he was as serious as any man
8236316 virtue is made of six parts three while in town at the place of your home and three while on journey the first three are reciting the quran frequently being at the mosque and spreading the way of allah to other lands the other three parts while travelling are spending showing virtuous behaviour and joking in what allah has permitted
8236317 joking appropriately is permissible for the prophet joked but he said what was true
8236318 do not be vague with others and do not joke
8236319 some of the scholars denounced joking for what it causes of offences spite and malice between people
8236320 what is prohibited is exaggerated or continuous joking as it distracts from worship of allah and being serious about religious matters this often leads to hard heartedness envy and loss of respect useful joking which aims to calm people or entertain or relieve them for a short time is permissible
8236321 that which allah has permitted which commits no sin and does not lead to separation between people
8236322 such humour does not hurt or criticize anyone it leads a person from sadness to happiness ceases the frown an allows people to relax and be themselves
8236323 the issues of islam are more serious than to be dealt with jokingly
8236324 i asked jaber ibn samra if he spent time with the prophet and he said
8236325 another time for making light was after the isha prayer humour is permitted with family uncles and siblings it is more preferred if it serves the purpose of advice and guidance or if it creates friendship and warmth between people
8236326 joking is prohibited when it is excessive and consistent it becomes ineffective and causes the heart to harden it distracts a person from worship of allah and concern with religious issues it often causes harm envy and disrespect if these elements are absent from a joke then it is what is permissible by islam the prophet would use humour to reach people and draw them together
8236327 we were at yazeed ibn harouns and he made a joke ahmad ibn hanbal cleared his throat and yazeed said who cleared his throat when he found out who it had been he put his hand on his forehead and cried why didnt you tell me ahmad ibn hanbal was here so i would not joke
8236328 do not joke with children to the extent that they lose respect for you
8236329 whoever jokes with an inappropriate person will lose that persons respect even if what he is saying is true one should be selective with whom he jokes
8236330 one should separate his behaviour between two groups of people one group is made up of public here he should be serious and purposeful with every word he speaks the other group is made up of people who are closer to him with this group he should be humorous and caring each of these behaviours will be beneficial and productive in the right place
8236331 i do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time i do not admit that right i do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the red indians of america or the black people of australia i do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race a more worldly wise race to put it that way has come in and taken their place
8236332 i dont see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people the issues are much too important for the chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves
8236333 treating toilet paper with this would make a great college gag
8236334 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8236335 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8236336 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
8236337 it makes a lot of sense that next week john mccain and george bush will be together in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8236338 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8236339 theres no place like home except for john mccain where theres no place like home like home like home like home
8236340 not only cant we afford four more years of bush mccain policies we cant afford four more months another decent line
8236341 john mccain says hes a maverick but hes voted with bush over 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8236342 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8236343 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8236344 george w bush came into office on third base and stole second and john mccain cheered him every step of the way we have to make sure everyone has a chance at bat
8236345 if you drill in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single answer proposition is a dry well
8236346 barack obama understands that the most important barrel of oil is the one you dont use
8236347 of the total 164 are individuals and 33 are organisations
8236348 this is the second highest number the most was in 2005 with 199
8236349 my problem is that i dont see a very likely candidate in china
8236350 this is a crucial moment cuba wants change the people want change
8236351 ahtisaaris plan was not designed as a plan to be carried out by one side

8236355 everyone knows that i can always get up for a race they know how powerful i am at thrusting and lunging through the water they should also know that this is the result of years of training and proper diet and is not because of some pill i took right before the race
8236356 my doing commercials for viagra or cialis would just be wrong
8236357 when i was a young athlete in munich in 1972 i could go for hours i was smooth on the glide and quick with the reactions my lunges and thrusts gave pleasure to everyone who watched me and dominated everything in the room
8236358 im a little older now and am not as quick off the blocks sometimes i need a little help to get me up and ready for the action thats why i take
8236359 they were all singing different high energy eartha kitt songs freestyling and gyrating their hips if we left them unattended for more than ten minutes they started copping off with each other
8236360 lifes too short not to have a laugh isnt it i know ive been a bit silly over the last few years but ive been involved with this project 24 7 and havent had a full nights sleep since the queens 80th birthday bash in 2006 so im always dropping off unexpectedly the last time it happened someone drew a pair of glasses and a little moustache on my face its hilarious when you think about it
8236361 hes been through a lot in the last few years but im sure i speak for every gay man in the uk when i say that well all be behind him this weekend
8236362 aye thes a long wayda go yet well take it one game at a tyme its a marathon not a sprint game of two halves

8236366 her movie from justin to kelly is one of my favoritist of all times especially when they got all them girls in their bikinis
8236367 we had him up ta the white house and he ate two full buckets of the colonels id hate to see him at a buffet
8236368 i think they call all us southern folks hicks just cuz he won
8236369 i can actually sing better n that feller maybe we could have a sing off or somethin
8236370 i seen that movie about here i like it best when mickey mouse is trying to sweep up all that water with them brooms
8236371 before i take off my slippers put on my bed cap and turn off the gas lantern by my brass bedpost
8236372 i stretch clear over to the other side of the bed reach into the inbox of my state of the art transcontinental carrier pigeon network and check if there is a note tied to the foot of old homer
8236373 old homer is as reliable as the steam engine and way more reliable than that new printing press or broadcast media
8236374 except of course when mrs wilsons cat is around old homer doesnt like cats he lost his wife and eighteen of kids to that cat
8236375 unfortunately old homer was actually killed and half eaten by the neighbors cat some years ago
8236376 we just didnt have the heart to tell john so we sent the deceased pigeon to a taxidermist to be stuffed weve been tying notes to its foot each night to keep mccain abreast of world events ever since
8236377 some girl go through a photography phase you know horses taking dumb pictures of your feet

8236394 musik ist heuzutage allgegenw rtig im restaurant in flugh fen im auto jede musik der man nicht zuh rt ist aber nur ger usch
8236395 der gedanke dass die wahre blasphemie im missbrauch eines musikalischen kunstwerks an sich liegen k nnte kam der firma offenbar nicht in den sinn

8236407 it is very important to ensure there is a means of instant gratification it may not expose you to all of the features and capabilities but at least the customer can touch it now that is what we had to do we had to simplify the product and get it out there
8236408 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8236409 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8236410 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8236411 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8236412 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8236413 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8236414 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8236415 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8236416 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8236417 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8236418 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days his personal physicians attributed this to exhaustion
8236419 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8236420 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8236421 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8236422 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8236423 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8236424 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8236425 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8236426 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8236427 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8236428 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8236429 im sad that were not standing here talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8236430 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking

8236462 condemns the decision of the russian federation to extend recognition to the south ossetia and abkhazia regions of georgia and calls upon russia to reverse its decision
8236463 russias decision violates the many un security council resolutions it has endorsed regarding georgias territorial integrity and is inconsistent with the fundamental osce principles on which stability in europe is based
8236464 georgias recovery security and stability are important to the alliance
8236465 russias actions have called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus nato calls on russia to respect georgias territorial integrity
8236466 vibinc as someone who doesnt have ap and has gone through several hassles with them i think they are bringing it on themselves
8236467 theres some rust in there and weve got to hopefully get him clean by the weekend
8236468 felt as close to a 100 as ive felt in a long time
8236469 i was working hard and trying to get the ball to open receivers and they made pretty good plays
8236470 but that doesnt mean the competition is over they both worked extremely hard
8236471 they both played well and have a ways to go but aaron really progressed
8236472 hes extremely mobile and has done a nice job with the deep ball is he perfect no he still needs to learn some things with game management
8236473 we dont ever want stuff like that to happen and then brush it off
8236474 most of us would have liked to see him poulter qualifying
8236475 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8236476 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8236477 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8236478 the aim was to qualify for the champions league and we did that i am absolutely delighted
8236479 of course a defeat hurts but in todays case there are no complaints generally speaking we played a good game
8236480 the team is in the champions league we have beaten a good team i have seen so many games like this that turn out to be complicated
8236481 this funding will allow farmers and ranchers to repair the unusually harsh damage to conservation efforts caused by the disaster conditions notably flooding and drought
8236482 usda has worked shoulder to shoulder with producers when weather turns against them and we remain involved to help in the weeks and months of recovery afterward
8236483 the environment was weaker this quarter than its been for a while
8236484 were not counting on it getting a whole lot better
8236485 i dont think the next couple of months are going to get any better
8236486 we entered into the alignment six years ago because we were firmly of the view it represented the best option for us for the development of our young players
8236487 we were also of the view that we could help create a pathway for local talent to the elite level and we are still very much of that view
8236488 we are still committed to and believe this alignment can work in the long term it was always going to take some time but with the right people in place and the right support from the local community it is time to make that a reality
8236489 it is critical the local community provide real support for the bendigo bombers it will underpin a club that has an important role to play in the development of football in the region
8236490 sport and sporting clubs also have a critical role to play in the wider community and for that reason it is important that the bendigo bombers survive and thrive
8236491 it has been unfortunate to have the number of injuries we have had and it has had an impact on essendon as well
8236492 given even luck we would envisage bendigo would have 10 12 senior listed players available each week last weekend there was just one and that is always going to make life difficult and it has done for much of this season
8236493 in his first year he played in a reserves premiership and the next year in a seniors night and day premiership
8236494 not many other people can say they have done that in his day when he was up and going he was as good as anyone he was a very effective midfielder come half back
8236495 there was a bracket of them in 2000 including rama mark and jason johnson and dean solomon those guys played a pivotal role the football they played was the difference between us being a really good side and an outstanding side
8236496 i think the proudest people there will be his wife mum and dad and close family because they have been through the entire ride with rama
8236497 the credit has to go to his wife she is an outstanding person and he has been a really good support his family will be the ones with a tear in their eye
8236498 if adam got bored he would start on a few of us that he knew we had a short fuse but he had a lot of pranks played on him too
8236499 he doesnt give away too much though he wouldnt tell us much when he got sick but that is the sort of guy he is he never told us much and he never complained he never said why me
8236500 you have to remember he is still young only 27 and most people in professional life only get going in their mid 30s so he has plenty of scope to find a new career after football
8236501 what he has experienced during 10 years at the club is incredible he has certainly packed a lot into those years and it has certainly been a ride

8236505 its up to the players to get the show back on the road as quickly as possible when the new management are appointed
8236506 tyrone were the better team setanta readers comment of the day yes but refs have to be given power to stamp it out
8236507 there was a year left on my existing contract so im really pleased to have been able to sort out this new contract now
8236508 its obvious to everybody at the ospreys that there are great things happening here weve got a quality squad and great coaches theres a real buzz about the place and were confident about our chances for the new season its clearly something that any player would want to be a part of
8236509 last season was a fantastic one for me personally i really made my mark in the side had plenty of game time made the wales squad and now i want to build on that over the next four years there are plenty of good centres at the ospreys so i cant take anything for granted but the situation is that the competition for places will benefit me will benefit the ospreys and will benefit wales with so many quality players pushing for two starting spots were all pushing each other onto better things as we realise that we have to work hard just to get near the squad
8236510 although still a youngster andrew has already proven his worth to the ospreys with more than 70 appearances to his credit already and last season we really saw him starting to make an impact
8236511 and sheila was the only one in the crowd who already knew the words which she sang simon le bon totally looked at her and smiled i can confirm that as opposed to my sisters assertion that garth brooks waved to her when we had shitty seats at the clearfield county fair many many years ago

8236543 the overall promise that this nation has made that if a person works hard enough he can make the most of their god given talents

8236604 ik was verbijsterd toen ik het weer in de winkel zag liggen van gaal had het contract van de columnisten opgezegd dus ik wist niet beter dat het zou stoppen later had ze het nog wel over een andere naam voor het blad maar ik heb niets meer gehoord
8236605 je kunt niet zomaar met cijfers naar de concurrent stappen iedere ondernemer snapt dat keyl gaf blijk van een vertrouwensbreuk
8236606 dat ligt niet aan de naam maar aan een fantastische redactie die precies aanvoelt wat de doelgroep wil sterker ik denk dat het blad misschien zelfs beter zal verkopen met een andere leuke vrouw op de cover
8236607 alles wat ik doe kost geld en van gaal heeft meer geld ik vind dit z erg het sloopt me de redactie vindt me ook een boze heks maar ze hebben me nooit gesproken dat is toch onvoorstelbaar ik bedoel als je voor bolletje werkt zeg je toch ook niet dat bolletje bedorven is
8236608 we gaan door maar we hebben nog niet besloten onder welke naam en in welke vorm

8236613 out of 30 indicators we went from 25 to 26 which is an improvement in our indicators which were very happy about you have to have 29 out of 30 to be ranked excellent unless you show significant improvement in value added and thats what happened in our case

8236617 he was introduced into the national honor society in high school and they gave him a nice trophy when he brought it home i wanted a picture of him with the trophy but he didnt want to the trophy didnt mean much to him just that he was in the national honor society

8236619 he was great with patients but behind the scenes with workers he touched lives through his practice

8236622 just his kindness dedication and work ethic meant a lot to me
8236623 he showed me how to be in life the man i am today

8236627 he was without a doubt the most professional businessman ive ever met
8236628 he had a lot of assets in that capacity and a main one was that he had the most committed and dedicated spouse in susan mcpeak

8236645 il senso religioso radicato nel cuore delluomo apre uomini e donne verso dio e li guida a scoprire che la realizzazione personale non consiste nella gratificazione egoistica di desideri effimeri esso piuttosto ci guida a venire incontro alle necessit degli altri e a cercare vie concrete per contribuire al bene comune le religioni svolgono un particolare ruolo a questo proposito in quanto insegnano alla gente che lautentico servizio richiede sacrificio e autodisciplina che a loro volta si devono coltivare attraverso labnegazione la temperanza e luso moderato dei beni naturali
8236646 la tua religione non autentica se tu non auguri allaltro ci che tu auguri per te stesso
8236647 affinch la nuova evangelizzazione sia fruttuosa occorre abituarsi allinstancabile sforzo del discernimento comunitario che aiuti a spogliarci di tutto ci che rende lento vecchio e pesante il nostro essere discepoli missionari
8236648 lesperienza fondante di una fede semplice che si fa vita e cultura
8236649 per il dono della loro vita e di questo ministero ecclesiale
8236650 aiuti a non rinchiuderci in modo tale da poter far fronte a questo crocevia della storia con la stessa audacia e lo stesso fervore missionario di colui che ha annunciato il vangelo come necessit impellente non a gloria sua ma come frutto di una missione che gli era stata affidata
8236651 scrivo a te catechista si legge nella lettera del cardinale bergoglio ai catechisti che nel tuo incontro settimanale con tanti volti che nella tua esperienza vicina a tante realt mutevoli avrai chiesto al signore molte volte luce per trovare le strade pi adeguate per essere strumento fedele in questo momento di cambiamento epocale a te catechista che come me e come chiesa povera e rinnovata dal dono di aparecida ci sentiamo schiacciati dalle difficolt che ci troviamo ad affrontare oggi per trasmettere la fede di generazione in generazione
8236652 ad aparecida scrive il porporato la chiesa prende coscienza di ci che si annunciava gi da vari anni ci che stiamo vivendo un cambiamento epocale i cambiamenti non si riferiscono ai molteplici sensi parziali che ognuno pu trovare nelle azioni quotidiane che svolge ma al senso che d unit a tutto ci che esiste
8236653 cose che pensavamo che non sarebbero mai avvenute o che almeno non avremmo mai visto le stiamo vivendo scrive il porporato e dinnanzi al futuro non osiamo neppure immaginare probabilmente ci che ci sembrava normale della famiglia della chiesa della societ e del mondo non lo sar pi ci che stiamo vivendo non qualcosa che dobbiamo aspettare che passi affinch le cose tornino a essere come sono sempre state
8236654 con grande dolore constatiamo che la fede che per pi di cinque secoli ha sostenuto la chiesa in america latina ha ceduto non viene pi trasmessa di generazione in generazione con la stessa fluidit lontano dal lamento o dalla condanna della situazione aparecida riconosce di non avere le risposte ai problemi e per questo rappresenta un invito a discernere con la luce dello spirito santo il modo in cui mettersi al servizio del regno in tale realt un atto di profonda umilt il riconoscimento pubblico del non sapere cosa occorre fare esattamente
8236655 essere predisposti a una conversione pastorale che implica un cambiamento di mentalit di atteggiamento e di comportamento per questo occorre una perseverante docilit allo spirito che converte i cuori e trasforma le comunit in segni eloquenti di un modo diverso di pensare e di vivere
8236656 per questo si percepisce lurgenza di una svolta decisa verso un nuovo orientamento pastorale accompagnata da una vera conversione pastorale
8236657 tutte le strutture di comunione della chiesa e con esse tutti i piani pastorali conclude il cardinale bergoglio richiedono questa conversione dalle piccole comunit le parrocchie della diocesi e le sue strutture pastorali a tutti i luoghi in cui pu avvenire lincontro con il signore famiglie movimenti scuole e universit nessuna realt ecclesiale deve esimersi dallentrare con decisione con tutte le sue forze nei costanti processi di rinnovamento missionario e dallabbandonare le strutture antiquate che non favoriscano pi una trasmissione coerente cio senza riduzioni della fede
8236658 sono molto preoccupato per la situazione dei cattolici nella mia diocesi e vorrei essere ora l presente purtroppo le violenze anti cristiane sono scoppiate proprio nel momento in cui ero appena giunto qui in kerala per partecipare alla celebrazione dellanniversario dordinazione di un mio confratello che qui svolge la sua missione conto di ripartire oggi stesso o al massimo domani per raggiungere la mia sede vescovile
8236659 tuttavia sottolinea monsignor raphael cheenath il livello di violenza ha compiuto un balzo in avanti mentre allora la rabbia degli estremisti aveva trovato sfogo nella distruzione dei beni dei cattolici ora invece diretta contro le persone il numero delle vittime non ancora definitivo ho ricevuto notizia che ci sono state cinque vittime e numerosi feriti alcuni in gravi condizioni prego dio che tutto questo abbia subito fine e si torni alla ragione nutro il massimo rispetto per i religiosi induisti tra cui anche il leader assassinato e credo che anche tra loro vi siano dei moderati che rispettano il nostro impegno a favore dei poveri non bisogna per tacere che c chi usa il pretesto pseudo religioso per scopi di carattere politico i cattolici dellorissa sono una piccola comunit circa luno per cento della popolazione i nostri fedeli sono tutti per una convivenza pacifica con gli appartenenti agli altri credi e hanno quando possibile buoni rapporti con i vicini induisti
8236660 ho parlato con monsignor babu mi ha riferito che la giovane missionaria laica morta per essere rimasta indietro nelledificio gi in fiamme mentre tutti fuggivano allesterno probabilmente il suo zelo laveva spinta ad accertarsi che tutti i piccoli orfani fossero effettivamente usciti anche padre eduard rimasto ustionato per lo stesso motivo oltre alle ustioni stato picchiato con ferocia dagli estremisti induisti che avevano appiccato il rogo i bambini insieme ad alcune suore si sono probabilmente nascosti nelle piantagioni delle vicinanze tuttavia finora non posso dire nulla di preciso sulla loro sorte prego dio che protegga queste vite innocenti
8236661 sicuramente fuggito per scampare alla folla di fanatici induisti radunatasi allesterno delledificio per appiccare il fuoco ho avuto con lui una concitata conversazione telefonica mi ha descritto con angosciate parole levolversi degli eventi gli ho raccomandato di pregare intensamente e di mettersi in salvo per quanto ne so il centro pastorale ha subito danni gravissimi forse irrimediabili questa era unopera che era costata tanti sacrifici ai fedeli delle mia diocesi eravamo molto orgogliosi dellopera realizzata
8236662 ho idee precise a proposito afferma larcivescovo di cuttack bhubaneswar ci sono forze ultra conservatrici che usano pretesti pseudo religiosi come le presunte conversioni forzate per imporre il loro controllo sulla societ le folle li seguono in buona fede spesso manipolate da false informazioni noi cristiani i cattolici in particolare veniamo perseguitati soprattutto per il nostro impegno sociale in favore dei pi poveri mi sembra evidente che c chi ha interesse a tenere i contadini e i fuori casta in uno stato di perenne soggezione noi cattolici non abbiamo mai fatto opera di proselitismo ma abbiamo sempre dato il buon esempio nelle opere assistenziali penso che per questi personaggi che soffiano sul fuoco questo nostro atteggiamento caritatevole sia unimperdonabile colpa

8236737 it was a fantastic way to end the fringe this year has been mired with quite a bit of controversy and to echo david odohertys sentiments comedians want to come to edinburgh and make people laugh
8236738 the spirit of the comedy fringe are the comedians end of story
8236739 far from looking like a magnanimous celebration of the comics it actually looked like the panel were saying to be honest no one epitomised the spirit of the fringe this year so were just going to give it to you all
8236740 in a year where there were fewer shows nominated than usual which already gave out the signal that the panel thought there were only seven shows in the whole fringe good enough to be on the list it only felt like a bit of a kick in the teeth that they couldnt think of anyone to give the prize to

8236742 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
8236743 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
8236744 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rates in children and for the fall in uninsured rates in the general population
8236745 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million
8236746 you just see the difference the new massachusetts health reform plan has made in improving coverage
8236747 45 7 million people who are uninsured is still a major problem there is no cause for celebration that we only have 45 7 million uninsured there is still a very serious problem the most serious problem we have in the health sector
8236748 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8236749 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8236750 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8236751 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8236752 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8236753 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8236754 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8236755 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8236756 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8236757 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in
8236758 having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8236759 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation

8236762 ao espanhol deram seis barcos e o nosso tivemos de o comprar
8236763 deixei a vela ol mpica porque vi que com os apoios que tinha nunca iria aos jogos para ganhar uma medalha
8236764 ainda tentei o projecto de pequim mas quando tinha de me preparar para o mundial a federa o n o me deixou treinar com o seu barco e queria obrigar me a compr lo a um m s de come ar o campeonato houve uma mudan a na classe que implicava comprar um mastro de carbono e tive de ser eu a faz lo
8236765 atlanta96 foi um projecto bem elaborado nessa altura havia mais dinheiro e t nhamos mais tripula es a seguir houve uma estagna o e sydney j foi o decl nio atenas2004 foi uma balb rdia e lembro me que no in cio do projecto de pequim nem o lvaro timoneiro de miguel nunes em 470 tinha treinador
8236766 o projecto deficiente ou quando alguns velejadores nem sempre t m treinadores
8236767 no projecto de atlanta existia esp rito equipa desde o motorista at ao presidente a partir da n o sei se por inveja ou por quererem aten o come aram a criar um mau ambiente que sufoca os atletas na vela quando se come a a dizer o que se pensa amea am com processos disciplinares
8236768 portugal precisa do gustavo lima na vela tal como a equipa que est com ele
8236769 pequim foi uma fantochada a n vel de apoios para a vela
8236770 fiquei com a ideia de que o povo portugu s n o percebe de desporto porque s v desporto extrafutebol de quatro em quatro anos de repente a televis o enfia as modalidades pelos olhos dentro e as pessoas acreditam em tudo que v em essa ignor ncia desportiva aliada s altas expectativas do comit ol mpico de portugal cop deu no rid culo que se viu desde o abandono e recandidatura de vicente moura s desculpas dos atletas
8236771 ao contr rio do que disseram o governo e o cop pequim2008 foi uma fantochada a n vel de apoios no esquema de apoios a vela foi altamente prejudicada porque as verbas foram atribu das em fun o do atleta e n o da especificidade da modalidade como a log stica no caso da vela em 2005 quando o projecto foi apresentado disse isso mesmo ao cop a nica culpada a federa o que naquela altura devia ter batido o p mas bater o p d muito trabalho e implica sofrer algumas consequ ncias
8236772 portugal s ganha medalhas com sorte e talento a n o ser que um velejador seja rico e resolva fazer um projecto seu portugal n o tem muita gente capaz de ganhar medalhas e a que tem est a ir se embora
8236773 esta direc o ainda n o conseguiu juntar apoios para fazer um programa como deve ser a federa o diz que tem um projecto de juniores que h oito anos fazem est gios e observa es conv m ver os resultados quais s o zero alguma coisa n o est a funcionar

8236794 number of nearby amenities is the leading predictor of whether people walk

8236803 its impossible to drive looking simply at the two dimensional night view display
8236804 and because the screen isnt in your direct field of view its difficult to monitor it while driving
8236805 in order to get to the mass market it has to enhance the driving experience

8236826 when we began the development of visonac we were seeking to provide a much improved treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne the results from these two studies clearly highlight that we are well on our way to achieving this goal the fact that we have been able to deliver good efficacy results with visonac while at the same time reducing pain and redness will be of major benefit to patients the second study which has demonstrated that we can simplify the overall treatment procedure with visonac while delivering equivalent efficacy is expected to help increase the penetration of visonac pdt into the overall acne market we look forward to confirming these positive findings in our phase iii program for visonac

8236859 i have seen four or five dvds of uzbekistan at the moment so for me it is not a big surprise anymore
8236860 for the players probably yes but we will have enough time to prepare for the game
8236861 i have always said that quality wise we are one of the best teams in asia
8236862 it is about circumstances it is about the trips we have to make and this time we will be well prepared we have to find out how the circumstances are when we arrive in tashkent
8236863 the china and middle east games we had to play under difficult circumstances so i am not so worried about that
8236864 it can never be worse than it was in dubai and qatar last june so the players will go there and adapt quite soon they will be ready

8236879 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue

8236885 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8236886 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8236887 data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage data access and timeliness
8236888 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8236889 this exercise is aimed at showing that knight riders is not just about kolkata we are looking at giving opportunities to cricket talent all over india

8236892 these groups almost welcome his candidacy because it gives them a focus for recruitment for fundraising and they have said as much he may end up being the most security protected candidate of any presidential election on account of his colour
8236893 there are many many groups that are deeply resentful of obamas candidacy that have said hateful and horrible things about him
8236894 most of them are just regular guys who work during the week and have a little too much fun at the weekends the majority of them are law abiding have families theyre just regular neighbourhood guys
8236895 they love their harley davidson motorcycles and love their brotherhood and the camaraderie of riding their bikes they are very pro government they stand behind the flag this is something they would never be involved in working with white supremacists would be an extremely unusual partnership
8236896 i have personally seen sos members wearing hats that say dirty white boy t shirts with swastikas and other nazi regalia
8236897 i dont believe that even a group like the sos would knowingly as an organisation get themselves involved in something like this because nothing good can come of it for them

8236905 we will be ready we have a data base of people willing to help and we could say we want 10 per cent now so lets talk
8236906 there is a long way to go but we believe we can have a genuine impact you cant score a goal if you are not on the pitch and we are certainly on the pitch as players

8236926 the growing coexistence of virtual and physical servers adds new layers of complexity to it management
8236927 tools such as vmwares virtualcenter do a great job of providing a single point of access to all vmware access methods but they only provide a partial view of the data center each server layer could potentially employ a different access tool with different authorization audit and administration layers instead of doubling or tripling the number of tools and adding extra complexity to data center administration a virtual machine as one more item in the it infrastructure that commandcenter secure gateway can manage
8236928 herefordshires rural way of life has been dealt a hammer blow with post office limited intent on axing more outlets here than anywhere else in the west midlands
8236929 everyone is deeply cynical about the process and although there are assurances that the plans are subject to a six week consultation post office limited will have to work hard to convince local people that this isnt a done deal
8236930 post offices are very often village stores too and are at the heart of village life especially in the more remote areas of the county herefordshire has a rapidly growing population of frail older people who depend on their local shop and post office and their quality of life and ability to be independent will be compromised severely if these closures go ahead
8236931 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers
8236932 we believe these proposals offer the best prospect for a sustainable way forward for post office services in herefordshire worcestershire and the west midlands bearing in mind the minimum access criteria and the other factors it has asked us to consider
8236933 i knew miriam for many years and she always distinguished herself as a servant of the community in brent

8236935 she was well respected by many people in the department as a great professional and will be missed by many staff
8236936 we are honoured to have had such a wonderful caring humanitarian mother whose purpose in life was to provide a better service for the young old and disabled people in brent
8236937 she will be tremendously missed even though she worked hard for the community she always put her family first her energy drive and passion are acknowledged by all who met her including ourselves
8236938 we are all comforted to find out how much she meant to others this will give us the strength courage and support that we need

8236946 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8236947 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women

8236953 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8236954 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8236955 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8236956 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8236957 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8236958 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8236959 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8236960 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8236961 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8236962 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8236963 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8236964 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8236965 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8236966 the third estate sunday review focuses on politics and culture were an online magazine we dont play nice and we dont kiss butt in the words of cher if you can dig it then im happy and if you cant then im sorry were not really sorry we just wanted a dig it quote dont like it there are millions of sites online move along youre blocking the view
8236967 coming away from kings lynn with any result is a tall order for most teams
8236968 our three danes will be riding the track for the first time but we are going there with a positive attitude
8236969 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8236970 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8236971 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8236972 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8236973 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8236974 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8236975 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8236976 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8236977 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8236978 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8236979 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8236980 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8236981 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8236982 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8236983 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8236984 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8236985 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8236986 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8236987 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8236988 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8236989 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8236990 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8236991 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8236992 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8236993 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8236994 the naysayers have gotten too much media attention while those who are engaged and do the hard work are too often ignored and criticized
8236995 whosoever acquires any influence here can obtain his share of legal plunder
8236996 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8236997 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8236998 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8236999 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8237000 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8237001 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8237002 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8237003 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8237004 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8237005 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8237006 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8237007 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8237008 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8237009 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8237010 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8237011 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8237012 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8237013 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8237014 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8237015 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8237016 isv virtual appliances should underpin a new surge in cloud use followed by self service mechanisms and enterprise connectors enabling organizations to cloudburst to using cloud services
8237017 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8237018 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8237019 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8237020 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8237021 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2
8237022 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers
8237023 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8237024 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8237025 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8237026 the namwolf conference is the only meeting of its kind that truly sets the standard for fostering thought provoking discussions on establishing diversity in our legal communities
8237027 this year promises to be another exciting event as we continue to grow our membership base we look forward to connecting nationally recognized minority and women owned law firms with companies
8237028 stay out of court stay out of the media and stay out of trouble the many faces of corporate compliance
8237029 that i have no health care benefits is the greatest challenge if there is a crisis theres nothing there to help
8237030 it makes me feel exasperated and frustrated i leave one job and go to another im still trying to be an involved parent and its very stressful
8237031 we see an hourglass economy where there is growth at the top in the financial and high tech sector the top of the scale and what we are missing is manufacturing jobs we are losing the middle
8237032 we are working hard to create jobs for people at every skill level whether its the airport or the seaport or positions with our corporate partners the seven year trend is positive a one year blip does not a trend make
8237033 working people did not share the economys recovery in the last business cycle and are at risk of being hit first and worst as we enter an economic downturn

8237040 it is crucial to present this fine film a cautionary tale for the entire world to act with courage despite fear and to speak truth to power is an inspiration for us all
8237041 i am hoping that the documentary will motivate people to vote

8237063 we begin by validating the current list of genes and improving the gene structure models using nimblegen tiled expression arrays the experimental results better delineate transcribed regions of the genome and guide the design of a comprehensive probe set for the 12 plex
8237064 in all 40 of the designed probes reside in unannotated regions no other array can easily afford this luxury in rapid time our transcription profiling experiments detect the co regulation of all identified genes and many yet unknown genes under a large range of conditions while simultaneously improving the genome annotation
8237065 use of the nimblegen 12 plex gene expression microarray is advantageous and more accurate than other platforms because it allows to run replicates within the same array that validate analysis within the same experiment
8237066 conducting array hybridization is relatively straightforward the analysis of the results is user friendly and does not require highly specialized informatics skills
8237067 the 12x135k arrays is a powerful tool for accomplishing high throughput gene expression profiling
8237068 combined with nimblegen custom design option and high probe density these arrays allow convenient and accurate analysis of a wide range of organisms from the simplest bacterium to complex mammals and plants these arrays will accelerate functional genomics research and support our goal of providing innovative solutions for faster and more accurate results

8237094 when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8237095 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama
8237096 i just liked how many people had their signs up
8237097 go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8237098 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8237099 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8237100 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8237101 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8237102 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8237103 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8237104 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8237105 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8237106 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8237107 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8237108 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8237109 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8237110 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8237111 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8237112 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8237113 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8237114 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do

8237122 a heavy decision weighed on my shoulders taking into account the freely expressed views of the ossetian and abkhazian peoples and based on the principles of the united nations charter i signed a decree on the russian federations recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8237123 what ive seen teachers do is take living breathing works of art and transform them into dessicated lab specimens fit for dissection
8237124 let me define the job of our players their job is to win win one on one win as a team win the grey cup otherwise why are we here
8237125 why are we taking all this abuse when we make the changes that we think will allow us to get better
8237126 you dont ever want to cut players or fire people but thats the nature of our business we love orlondo and we wish him well but sooner or later your career ends
8237127 were always in transition life is about transition were not going to keep this group together for the next 10 years or even five
8237128 with orlondo he felt like he was disrespected after being a co captain for four years
8237129 i guess a couple of the guys in the locker room feel that way as well but this is football and nothing is guaranteed around here nothing
8237130 when your defence isnt like it used to be then theyre going to make some changes it was loud shock value treatment with steinauer being cut and we all know our jobs are on the line and we have to perform
8237131 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8237132 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8237133 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8237134 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8237135 it was so disturbing how many weapons they found people are going how the hell did that happen
8237136 the rumours and speculation and information from sources arent what were going to deal with
8237137 were going to deal with facts that we find through our investigation
8237138 those kinds of questions will definitely be asked and will be answered
8237139 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8237140 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8237141 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8237142 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8237143 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8237144 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8237145 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8237146 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8237147 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8237148 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8237149 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8237150 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8237151 well let you know if we can use your services
8237152 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8237153 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8237154 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8237155 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8237156 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8237157 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8237158 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8237159 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8237160 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8237161 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8237162 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8237163 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8237164 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8237165 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8237166 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8237167 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8237168 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8237169 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8237170 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8237171 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8237172 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8237173 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8237174 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8237175 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8237176 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8237177 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8237178 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8237179 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8237180 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8237181 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8237182 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
8237183 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
8237184 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
8237185 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
8237186 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
8237187 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
8237188 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8237189 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
8237190 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
8237191 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
8237192 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
8237193 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
8237194 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
8237195 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
8237196 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
8237197 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8237198 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8237199 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8237200 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8237201 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8237202 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8237203 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8237204 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8237205 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8237206 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8237207 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8237208 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8237209 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8237210 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8237211 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8237212 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8237213 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8237214 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry
8237215 this is the first year with web 2 0 that candidates gave the tools to the voters allowing them to help raise money
8237216 we already had a powerful compensation plan rich with bonuses and onetime commissions now it quickly covers the monthly subscription fees associated with being in business with vmdirect
8237217 with the economy worsening it was important we enhanced our program so our business partners could create a more lucrative multiple stream of income the new enhancements are absolutely brilliant and are already creating a buzz of excitement within our affiliate base not seen before
8237218 we are on track to becoming one of the top destination sites in asia
8237219 we are now averaging more than half a million clicks to our site each day and expect this to increase substantially in the coming months through the introduction of more user friendly interfaces in the future
8237220 what originally attracted me to coming back to texas tech was the opportunity to work with coach larry hays
8237221 i was getting to the point in my coaching career where i might not do it too much longer so texas tech was an attractive job
8237222 what tech was able to do in the 1990s was really create a niche in the way they recruited california junior colleges
8237223 they also had great support from the town and were well coached partially what made tech decline were the new rules in place that made it harder to get and keep juco players
8237224 hays really had it going here with anderson and evans as his assistants but then they left and all of a sudden the dynamic of the program changed
8237225 things like that dont usually lead to stability for a program
8237226 we have to get back to winning to be able to recruit really well
8237227 we want a lot of texas high school kids but we also want to expand our horizons across the country we need to sell that lubbock sunshine
8237228 spencer is just a hard worker and is willing to do whatever he can to make a program better
8237229 he did a tremendous job with everyone he worked with here at osu but most important his work ethic was something i greatly appreciated
8237230 if you can get recruits to visit texas tech i think youre in good shape
8237231 the problem is that 85 percent of the recruits we speak with havent been to lubbock and act like the city is in a different state we must change that perception and make our university more accessible
8237232 you have to coach to your personality and my personality calls for me to be hyperactive and hard nosed
8237233 if you coach and recruit to your personality chances are youll be successful
8237234 i think the key for spencer or any coach is to find the player that fits in best with your program
8237235 accomplishing that goal at texas tech will be his first step in the right direction
8237236 i think its going to be beneficial to have so many new faces in the program this fall but we have to get more athletic across the board
8237237 we also have to learn how to pitch at a high level because if we cant do that we have no shot at competing for titles
8237238 if you can win a national title in corvallis you can do it in lubbock
8237239 i remember when we had trouble getting elite talent to go to oregon state now the beavers have recruits knocking down their door my goal is to bring that type of environment to texas tech

8237241 lo grande de nuestros atletas es que no tienen miedo
8237242 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8237243 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8237244 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8237245 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8237246 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8237247 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8237248 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8237249 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8237250 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8237251 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8237252 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8237253 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8237254 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8237255 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8237256 i think we have a good non conference schedule which will challenge us a great deal before the socon season starts up personally it will be a lot of fun for me to go up against my former boss melissa shelton at william amp mary and my former team at virginia the socon will be very tough this year and it will be a battle for the top spot in the north division with the hard work we put in this spring im expecting some great things

8237314 as a jew as an american and as a democrat i want to talk about national security national defense and not sacrificing israel or rewarding terrorists and that is not where20obama and the democrats are right now

8237325 none of this will be easy some of it may involve abrogating britains signature to various international agreements not least the various european treaties nor does much of this new populism appear to be immediately in prospect despite the darkening clouds over the world economy it could move rapidly on to the agenda should the crisis worsen markedly but it is also possible that it will take time to piece together a populist coalition we have touched already on some of the elements that might join such an alliance small business people and farmers if there are any left independent professionals and shopkeepers then there are those filling the basic supervisory roles that ought to be the backbone of society railway station managers and their equivalents in bus depots and motorway service stations police sergeants prison officers high street store managers noncommissioned officers in the forces and similar we would seek to add two significant blocks of members manufacturing and export businesses and trade union members industry and those working in it have been the biggest losers from the olympian experiment as productive capacity has been destroyed and millions of manufacturing jobs wiped out those owning running and working in industry know better than anyone the virulence with which new olympianism has blighted the economy both union members and managers have much to gain from a more sensible attitude to industry

8237360 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon

8237363 pan religious faith based political action strategies i think we are going to see a lot more of this in the future
8237364 this is a rising up over a 5 000 year old institution that is being hammered right now
8237365 if proposition 8 fails there is an inevitable loss of religious freedom
8237366 it is critical that we recruit talented young people into our industry at all levels
8237367 the support of pioneer and pic allows us to offer very generous scholarship awards to tomorrows pork industry leaders
8237368 it is critical that we recruit talented young people into our industry at all levels
8237369 the support of pioneer and pic allows us to offer very generous scholarship awards to tomorrows pork industry leaders
8237370 i believe the program is very valuable and we encourage other organizations to join us in our efforts to continue to make this industry competitive through the development of a talented workforce
8237371 it would create a very awkward situation for the aland islands if they rejected the lisbon treaty we dont have experience of such a matter
8237372 today there is a strong feeling among our politicians that there is not a qualified majority in favour of lisbon

8237374 if through these public hearings we establish that the overwhelming majority of south africans want the scorpions retained we will take it seriously
8237375 despite the committee chairpersons attempts to engineer the public participation processes in support of the african national congress resolution to shut down the scorpions their efforts have failed more than 50 of submissions oppose the closure of the scorpions 134 submissions out of a total of 247
8237376 it is inexplicable that only 247 submissions have made it into the final report despite the da alone submitting 7 978 written submissions by the deadline and many other submissions being sent directly by the public
8237377 it is clear that the portfolio committees have excluded the bulk of these submissions in an attempt to downplay the extent of the public outrage at the decision to disband the unit
8237378 the da wrote to the speaker asking that a special inquiry be made into the issue of discarded submissions on august 5 2008 we have never received a reply
8237379 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it

8237381 is merging the nda and equality authority raising questions for angela kerins
8237382 saturday was not acceptable and i was even angry running into monday the players got the wrath of that
8237383 tonight the response was first class we needed to be better without the ball we were compact and we competed
8237384 their three goals were premier league quality give them half a chance and theyll score but were strong here and we believed we could cause an upset
8237385 if you want to see hard evidence of the failure and unfairness of the free market then you need look no further than rural britain
8237386 the conclusion of the office of fair trading oft that there had been price fixing and collusion between major supermarkets and the big dairy companies and that this price fixing had led to profiteering to the value of 270 million at the expense of consumers
8237387 we are disappointed that we have been penalised for actions that were intended to help british farmers but recognise the benefit of a speedy settlement with the oft
8237388 the price initiatives in 2002 and 2003 which were widely and publicly reported at the time were designed to help british dairy farmers at a time of considerable economic pressure and public debate about whether farmers were getting a fair price for their products
8237389 everyone at asda regrets what happened particularly as we are passionate about lowering prices our intention was to provide more money for dairy farmers who were under severe financial pressure at the time
8237390 the supermarkets were fined for getting together to pay the farmers more
8237391 it has seen no evidence that the extra revenue raised by the price hikes went to farmers
8237392 i think its fair to characterise left wing as concerned about improving the conditions of those who are suffering most from the present arrangement of society
8237393 concern about the condition of others implies that you want to do something about it something which is not being done already
8237394 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008

8237396 he has got his hips out of place at the moment he has even got to have an operation on his hip which he skipped but hes having it done soon
8237397 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behavior and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
8237398 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behavior are not well understood
8237399 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behavior that conforms to our values from behavior that does not
8237400 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
8237401 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
8237402 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
8237403 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
8237404 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
8237405 its a great relief to everyone he is getting treatment
8237406 ive been over that bridge a few times over the years i know its a tight squeeze

8237412 isv virtual appliances should underpin a new surge in cloud use followed by self service mechanisms and enterprise connectors enabling organizations to cloudburst to using cloud services
8237413 in addition to direct sales to enterprises going forward it hopes that extending out from private clouds to public ones what we like to call cloudbursting will become a prevailing it weather pattern and provide it with additional opportunities
8237414 zimory will be covering off the key cloudy marketplaces and activities public cloud internal cloud cloudbursting grow over from internal to public clouds and cloudstorming connecting multiple clouds
8237415 the verticalization of the cloud would provide marketing benefits as friedman notes while also providing a possible means of addressing issues of information security crucial to industries such as health care and financial services
8237416 it is these companies that have dramatically leveraged their internal and originally private cloud computing infrastructures to significant economic benefit
8237417 with cloud computing becoming more and more popular large corporations are likely to set up their own clouds and integrate them with external clouds like amazon ec2
8237418 if an enterprise were to run an app in an external cloud and wants to connect that to their systems of record in their own datacenters they might want to consider the same platform in their data centers

8237422 platinis idee ist dass k nftig reine u 19 mannschaften teilnehmen es wird vielleicht auf einen kompromiss hinauslaufen ich halte die teilnahme von u 21 teams f r einen m glichen gemeinsamen weg die klubs m ssten sich dann zur abstellung ihrer spieler verpflichten ohne dass olympia in den internationalen spielkalender aufgenommen wird
8237423 nicht mit am tisch sitzen wird das internationale olympische komitee

8237433 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8237434 they have linked their action to not being taken off the state sponsor of terrorism list
8237435 the other members of the six party talks have made it clear that the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for pyongyangs nuclear programme
8237436 so thats not a new demand thats a longstanding demand its not just a us demand its a demand by the other five members of the six party talks

8237440 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this interfaith gathering is proof of that
8237441 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8237442 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8237443 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8237444 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george w bush and his failed policies
8237445 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone
8237446 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8237447 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
8237448 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
8237449 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
8237450 this is a race where sen obama should be further ahead
8237451 these people will decide this election if they go to mccain in large numbers he will win the election
8237452 we want to exploit more opportunities online and focus on pushing our product messages through online
8237453 tv is great for getting our messages to millions but we want to begin to use online more to target specific groups
8237454 its about getting consumers to interact with the brand and with our campaigns through specific sites
8237455 outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
8237456 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
8237457 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
8237458 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat tactics
8237459 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8237460 came from a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
8237461 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
8237462 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8237463 no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to its neighbors
8237464 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient

8237469 people with als maybe able to move their mouth a little but they cant exhale enough air from their lungs to produce audible speech but since the speech signals are produced by the brain even if they cannot speak we can intercept those signals and create the speech for them

8237472 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8237473 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8237474 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8237475 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8237476 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8237477 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8237478 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8237479 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8237480 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8237481 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8237482 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8237483 n early 60 percent of boys whom researchers classified as bullies in grades 6 9 were convicted of at least one crime by the age of 24
8237484 and get this 40 percent of those same boys grew up to have three or more criminal convictions
8237485 that means other adults have to step up at schools camps sporting events and youth activity centers
8237486 we need to tell parents when their children are being bullies and we should teach all kids to refuse to join in the taunting it is abuse pure and simple children can be scarred for life by a bully and once robbed of their self esteem they can suffer from mental and physical problems drop out of school and even commit suicide
8237487 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8237488 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8237489 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8237495 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8237496 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8237497 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8237498 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8237499 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8237500 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8237501 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8237502 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8237503 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8237504 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8237505 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that

8237548 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8237549 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8237550 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8237551 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8237552 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8237553 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

8237574 john mccain diz que a economia est sadia john mccain n o acha que ter 47 milh es de pessoas sem assist ncia m dica uma crise john mccain quer privatizar a seguridade social com uma agenda como esta faz todo sentido que john mccain e george w bush estejam juntos nas cidade g meas na pr xima semana porque est muito dif cil de diferenci los

8237576 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8237577 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8237578 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8237579 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8237580 ive never heard the f word before so its ok
8237581 increases in the number of imaging scanners over the last few years mean that the majority currently installed and in use in canada are less than six years old
8237582 these newer machines are using the latest technology to produce more detailed scans
8237583 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
8237584 our results demonstrate that heritable mutations of alk are the main cause of familial neuroblastoma and that germline or acquired activation of this cell surface kinase is a tractable therapeutic target for this lethal paediatric malignancy
8237585 it not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
8237586 this finding means that it is possible to offer simple non invasive screening for patients with a family history of neuroblastoma
8237587 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
8237588 identification of alk as a major familial neuroblastoma predisposition gene
8237589 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
8237590 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
8237591 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
8237592 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
8237593 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
8237594 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
8237595 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
8237596 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
8237597 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
8237598 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
8237599 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
8237600 prescription medication borrowing and sharing among women of reproductive age
8237601 it is clear that patients need to be counseled about the potential risks of sharing and borrowing medications especially if they are women of reproductive age
8237602 externalities in the classroom how children exposed to domestic violence affect everyones kids
8237603 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
8237604 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
8237605 there are many reasons for disruptive classroom behavior domestic violence is one particularly good indicator of a troubled child
8237606 based on these results we conclude that this new ethanol based hand sanitizer is a promising option for reducing the transmission of enteric viruses including norovirus by food handlers and care providers
8237607 we report that oral inoculation with a y pseudotuberculosis strain selected for its very low virulence induces an efficient immunity against bubonic plague without causing adverse reactions
8237608 this demonstrates that a live attenuated y pseudotuberculosis can be a promising vaccine against bubonic plague
8237609 in conclusion l salivarius cect5713 and l gasseri cect5714 appear to be an efficient alternative for the treatment of lactational infectious mastitis during lactation

8237616 this study marks a very important milestone for the prevention of vap in hospitals one of the major benefits of the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube is that it is the first prevention option available that requires no further action after placement by the healthcare provider
8237617 in developing the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube bard sponsored the largest randomized controlled trial in the field of vap prevention and we are pleased that the efforts of the independent clinical investigators have been recognized by such a renowned scientific journal publication in jama reflects the quality of their study and significance of their results we look forward to the benefits that the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube can provide hospitals and clinicians in their efforts to reduce the incidence of vap and improve patients lives

8237626 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8237627 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8237628 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8237629 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8237630 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8237631 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8237632 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8237633 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8237634 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8237635 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8237636 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8237637 it is the duty of those serving the people in public place
8237638 to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the government economically administered
8237639 because this bounds its right to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen and because public extravagance begets extravagance among the people

8237641 mddatacor has a proven track record of providing physicians with tools that improve patient care while helping them achieve financial rewards for delivering high quality evidence based care

8237644 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
8237645 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
8237646 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
8237647 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
8237648 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
8237649 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships
8237650 clearly we are excited about reaching this important milestone while each of our phase ii trials will stand on its own and give us valuable information in separate medical indications this trial will give us the first information on safety and efficacy in dermal wound healing currently there are no pharmacological agents approved for improving the healing of pressure ulcers and we look forward to reporting the results once they are available

8237656 there are all those people out there and if they wait too long theyre going to die an early death or degenerate to the point where they may need heart transplants
8237657 in the long run adult medicine needs to be the home for these folks

8237664 too often security can take a backseat to compliance thats why the aegenis group recommends that organizations deploy a web application firewall to meet pci requirement 6 6 and benefit from actual protection of vulnerabilities identified by code reviews or vulnerability scans
8237665 our experience has determined that the dynamic nature of web applications makes web application firewalls the most appropriate and cost effective means for securing payment card information

8237673 the student loan industry has experienced a volatile year and the impact of this volatility is starting to trickle down to parents and students tighter lending standards and falling housing prices have made it harder for parents to tap home equity loans and lines of credit to pay their kids education bills
8237674 it is critical for parents and students to have options if you dont apply you cant be accepted if you are not accepted to multiple colleges you dont have choices
8237675 each college has a different cost of attendance based on factors such as tuition fees room board projected expenses and regional costs of living parents and students want to weigh their best options of grants scholarships loans and work study
8237676 its creating issues where families are coming to us asking us for institutional help saying hey can i get more money any way to try to help get us through the spring semester but i think more colleges are going to see even more of this and feel the impact of this next year

8237686 but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope
8237687 the judge agreed with our evidence that patients would suffer if the payment cuts were allowed to stand
8237688 we presented compelling evidence that many family physicians would be unable to continue seeing medi cal patients
8237689 because the department of health care services medi cal payments already were far below the costs of providing care the cut would have forced many family physicians to close their practices to new medi cal patients
8237690 as advocates for our patients and for the publics health we just could not stand by and watch patients access to care deteriorate even further than it already has
8237691 when family physicians are forced for economic reasons to stop seeing medi cal patients there is an impact on quality of life and cost of care
8237692 patients often delay seeking care and when they absolutely must see a doctor they end up in already overburdened emergency rooms where care is more expensive and follow up care cant be tracked the public health of california depends on people staying as well as possible and when ill being treated promptly primary care doctors including family physicians are the first line of defense against declining public health and escalating epidemics like obesity diabetes and heart disease the courts decision keeps this critical public health element in place

8237712 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

8237718 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
8237719 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
8237720 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
8237721 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

8237770 i think had we done that some of the issues that you have uncovered in your investigation would not be as prominent within the system today as they seem to be
8237771 senator obama feels that patients deserve more protections than the patients bill of rights not fewer
8237772 one of the real tragedies of our health care system is that people who have had health insurance have done all the right things have paid their premiums they pay their co pays when they see their doctors and when they need it most the coverage isnt there
8237773 thats whats creating a lot of anxiety in the health care system
8237774 he would change the nature of the relationship so even if an insurance company has the power to interfere they would no longer have the incentive to
8237775 the reason they intervene now is because they make money by cutting off either people or treatments and we want to people to make money by delivering good health care and thats the purpose of the reforms
8237776 one of the real complexities in the current system is that fact that we have 50 states each with their own set of regulations governing insurance
8237777 you have to fight your battles at the state level and it really makes it very complex because it means you have to fight 50 battles rather than one at the federal level
8237778 my office hears from constituents all the time who have seen insurance companies deny care have seen insurance companies do everything but march into the hospital or doctors waiting room and try to cut off their conversation
8237779 the insurance companies have been far too intrusive in violating what should be a sacrosanct doctor patient relationship
8237780 i think it could be helpful to the physician community in operating on a level playing field
8237781 i dont think they are operating on a level playing field now
8237782 it is fixable it is going to take time and it is going to take some changes
8237783 the best way to provide care for patients is to create value for patients better safety better service
8237784 and one of the main ways of doing all of this is to coordinate
8237785 thats where insurance companies could play a significant role a positive role in making part of the insurance plan a care coordination model for the patients that they insure
8237786 it is a different approach when you think of the insurer as somebody you want to partner with and somebody who wants to do a better job for their beneficiaries
8237787 im very worried about the fact that the health care conversation in america is all about putting 44 million more people into the system which is certainly all well and good for the 44 million who right now dont have reliable access
8237788 but what nobody is talking about is if the system isnt shored up with more finances and more access to providers you are just going to dilute things further and you are going to have a lot more miserable people who now are insured but the insurance isnt covering them and the waits are long and the visits are short
8237789 it seems like a very superficial election year conversation as opposed to figuring out what we are going to provide who is going to provide it and how it is going to be there when people need it i dont hear anybody taking that approach
8237790 there are now 50 and i am certain that we will shortly have even more
8237791 he finished training and he felt he had to go to harvard business school and maybe leave medicine
8237792 when i say to them why are you doing this
8237793 they have to quit moaning and get back to the business of figuring out what is the most cost effective care they can give their patients
8237794 blue collar workers are fantastic but medicine is not a blue collar job we need very creative people with a lot with great memories and ability to correlate a and b it is not a road job but thats what it is turning into
8237795 the total loss of control the corporatization the unfunded mandates big overhead thats been a frustration to most of us
8237796 a lot of things are taking away from the satisfaction of being a doctor the doctor patient relationship is the biggest
8237797 growing up in medicine i was born to believe there was a lot of tradition
8237798 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8237799 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8237800 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8237801 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8237802 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8237803 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8237804 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8237805 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8237806 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8237807 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8237808 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector
8237809 todays wi fi handoff protocols are incredibly fragile in outdoor environments and mobile environments artificially limited to talking to only one access point or only one base station at a time even though there may be other base stations in the area

8237829 biden is a guy that even though hes from delaware he calls scranton home he comes here a lot and i think the people he appeals to are the type of people that scrantonians and northeastern pennsylvanians want to vote for

8237837 causeth commands all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and
8237838 if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god
8237839 here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus

8237842 the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
8237843 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
8237844 the complete silence of the new testament so far as any explicit command for the sabbath sunday the first day of the week or definite rules for its observance are concerned
8237845 up to the time of christs death no change had been made in the day
8237846 so far as the record shows they the apostles did not give any explicit command enjoining the abandonment of the seventh day sabbath and its observance on the first day of the week
8237847 during the old law saturday was the day sanctified but the church instructed by jesus christ and directed by the spirit of god has substituted sunday for saturday so now we sanctify the first not the seventh day sunday means and now is the day of the lord
8237848 the very act of changing the sabbath into sunday which protestants allow of because by keeping sunday strictly they acknowledge the churchs power to ordain feasts and to command them under sin
8237849 the bible and the bible only is the religion of protestants
8237850 the observance of sunday by the protestants is an homage they pay in spite of themselves to the authority of the catholic church
8237851 all both small and great rich and poor free and bond
8237852 them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god
8237853 we ran our campaign trusting god that his will would be done we want to give god the glory and let the people know we appreciate their support
8237854 they were all great there was no hard feelings or anything during the campaign it kept us out of the news
8237855 she decided to run and that was basically it people thought she would do a good job
8237856 she wants to get the fire department up to where it needs to be also she wants to look at beautification for the city ways to help the senior citizens and strengthen the parks and recreation
8237857 the obama campaign hopes that sen bidens scranton roots will give the democrats a boost in pennsylvania this poll was mostly done before bidens selection was announced so it is too early for any indication whether that will turn out to be the case obamas still in good shape in pennsylvania but his lead has been cut by almost half in the last two months
8237858 times have changed and the election is now very much a tossup in these states
8237859 sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start
8237860 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world

8237874 when i got my hospital bill i almost had another heart attack
8237875 my income stopped i couldnt do real estate my mind was so foggy i couldnt function
8237876 you think that people in this age group are sort of set with their fixed income and their nest egg and what really emerged from the report shows that this is not the case
8237877 fewer people than ever have enough savings and home equity to carry them through their retirement years this trend is more than likely going to continue
8237878 older people use their credit cards for medications or medical bills when they could not otherwise afford them
8237879 many take out cash advances on their credit card to help a family member usually a child or grandchild who needed help with medical bills housing or a car i hear that story at least once a week
8237880 older people know the meaning of the word commitment and they are truly remorseful that they cannot pay the bills as they come in
8237881 im certain that many of my clients would go to their graves paying debts if the creditors would be willing to work with them
8237882 it got so bad i was in tears all the time i thought how am i going to get well when i have people hounding me for money that i dont have ive always paid my bills and ive always believed that if you buy something youre supposed to pay for it i felt guilty and i still feel guilty
8237883 if you owed more than you owned and you were never were going to get out from underneath that you could petition the court for forgiveness of debt and start all over so you could be a contributor to the economy

8237890 for the first time a thorough sensitivity analysis of internationally comparable poverty estimates has been carried out second a poverty line that is relevant specifically to the asia and pacific region has been adopted
8237891 while the 1 a day poverty line remains an appropriate benchmark for counting the extent of extreme poverty in asia and the developing world more generally in a region that has witnessed rapid economic growth it might also be time to evaluate poverty incidence using a benchmark that reflects the regions dynamism
8237892 ppps are one of the most vital ingredients in generating internationally comparable estimates of poverty
8237893 our aim in this study was to shed light on how alternative approaches to compiling purchasing power parities can influence internationally comparable estimates of poverty
8237894 clearly the choice of ppp used matters a lot to the final estimates of poverty and it is therefore critical that we price the most appropriate set of goods and services this report shows that the collection of poverty specific prices the feasibility of which has been demonstrated by 16 developing asian countries is possible
8237895 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme

8237897 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8237898 and the question is then why is basically in american politics so much focused on ahmadinejad i think he serves the function that saddam hussein played hes an easy person to demonize one can call ahmadinejad many things but a dictator he is by no means he cant even he doesnt even have the power to appoint his own cabinet ministers its a presidency with very limited power and to claim that he is in a position to threaten the united states or israel is just bizarre frankly
8237899 i think there are probably no military options to disrupt the iranian program significantly because i doubt the us or israel know enough about where its key elements are hidden he wishes
8237900 iran at present does not represent a threat to israels existence if iran were allowed to develop nuclear weapons israel would be at realistic threat of more or less instantaneous annihilation
8237901 right that the only good response to this threat is engagement

8237940 they might not mean too much to the senior pros but to people like me they mean a lot
8237941 these are the games im going to have to impress in to get into the first team
8237942 i am looking forward to playing at ewood in front of the crowd again and hopefully we will get a few thousand in
8237943 after coming on as a substitute for the youth team when i was 15 if i start tomorrow it will be a sign of progression which is obviously what im looking to do
8237944 its not make or break but i need to get games in the premier league i am at that age now where i need to be playing
8237945 if im not playing i will have to look elsewhere obviously i want to play for blackburn and i will do my best but if i dont i will have to look elsewhere
8237946 they wont have the quality we will have but we will have to stand up to the test and earn the right to play
8237947 if i am playing regularly in blackburn first team i would expect to get into the ireland team
8237948 i thought it was a good performance these kind of games are always potential banana skins if you dont perform properly then you can find a few upsets in the early rounds
8237949 the boys did really well scored three good goals and i think just as importantly kept a clean sheet and i thought they defended well
8237950 its funny how football throws up these little things but the back four did well so obviously it will be down to the manager to decide thats two clean sheets on the bounce so well see
8237951 the managers got a squad that hes got to choose 11 players from so the challenge is there for everybody
8237952 im no different to anybody else i need to try to earn my place in the team
8237953 the performance last night showed me its going to be difficult but its something im looking forward to
8237954 ive not played enough up the road which is disappointing but thats football sometimes
8237955 theres no point dwelling on it ill just get on with it down here
8237956 the injury didnt help and when i came back the players in front of me did well for the second part of the season so i can have no qualms about the manager sticking with the players that he decided to go with
8237957 ive heard some good things about the manager and ive been told a lot a good things about the boys so i cant wait to get start properly
8237958 my first training session will be tomorrow morning so im looking forward to it
8237959 but it was good to get on the bench and be in the changing room for the game
8237960 the ambition is to try to do as well as i can personally and obviously to help burnley as well its a big club and theyre looking to kick on
8237961 from my point of view i just want to come and play football
8237962 its a good honest physical league and i really enjoyed the challenge
8237963 we have been chasing him for a while but obviously the finances involved along with a couple of other things did not make it possible until now
8237964 he is a player i have full admiration for i remember him at aberdeen where he was held in such high esteem that sunderland eventually paid 1m for his services
8237965 unfortunately he had no sooner signed than he picked up an injury and obviously he ended up finding it hard to get back into roy keanes side
8237966 the government is making about 3billion in tax from tourism

8237976 the universitys extremely successful annual irish conference has raised the profile of irish culture in the city over the past few years
8237977 this weeks event will raise that profile further and will also highlight to the people of sunderland the importance of this culture and its people to the city
8237978 the north east and sunderland in particular is an obvious choice for such a high profile event given the amount of people with irish descent in the region the links with irish business and the irish connections at sunderland afc with niall quinn roy keane and the drumaville consortium
8237979 because of the irish links with the football club the university and business we decided we would have the festival in sunniside gardens to strengthen irish links and raise the profile at the same time
8237980 the dubliners gave off the vibe that they felt good about being irish and who cared what anybody else thought
8237981 they had a swagger and a confidence more than any other irish group at that time
8237982 he helped a lot of english people accept irish people he worked against the prejudices of the english against the irish
8237983 ronnie drew reminded t h e m that all that was coming out of ireland wasnt bad
8237984 he helped that process of being able to stand up with confidence and say im irish
8237985 you hear about the pogues and u2 and the emotions they brought out in irish people but well before them was ronnie drew and the dubliners
8237986 they showed that irish people were interesting warm friendly and cool
8237987 there are two presentation nuns at the st osburgs parish that i attend in coventry one of them said they had a convent in peru run by two irish nuns and that i should call
8237988 we got a taxi and this nun met us outside this very poor area she gave us a tour of the town dump where they have been living for 15 years
8237989 there are 3 000 mountain indians who were driven out by communist terrorists who burnt all their homes and drove them out of the mountains
8237990 the government dont want to know them the catholic church in peru doesnt want to know them the only people that support them are the missionary society in ireland

8238188 o resultado obtido pela medida naturalmente indesej vel do ponto de vista social e contraproducente para o objetivo de expans o da base de assinantes em dire o classe c principalmente quando se leva em considera o que dado o atual cen rio de converg ncia digital a assinatura de um pacote de tv paga aumenta a possibilidade de que o assinante tamb m adquira o servi o de banda larga atendendo a pol tica governamental de inclus o digital

8238215 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty

8238231 i trust that he has the interest of the youngest soldier in his command in his heart and that he will not leave a single soldier in iraq one day longer than necessary
8238232 we need as a country to be focusing more enforcement against those employers who are kind of holding a carrot out at the end of the stick
8238233 slice off a small part of who i am i refuse to do that theres nothing positive really that they bring to the table they are the death of true representative government

8238237 around 75 100 militants attacked a checkpost on the night of august 26 27 security forces effectively repulsed the attack reportedly 11 militants were killed and 15 20 others injured the statement said
8238238 helicopters shelled militant hideouts in the salarzai and nawagai areas of bajaur tribal region today killing eight militants and wounding 12 others a security official said
8238239 will iraq disintegrate if the united states withdraws its combat troops
8238240 yes this is all true lets go on with business as usual
8238241 ballsy unapologetic we have to go after the fat cats type of discourse
8238242 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8238243 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8238244 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8238245 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8238246 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8238247 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8238248 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8238249 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8238250 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8238251 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8238252 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8238253 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8238254 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8238255 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8238256 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8238257 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8238258 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8238259 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8238260 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments

8238295 of course at that time we were trying in a war

8238299 but i was absolutely convinced that there was wine of a high standard that we could make now there is a very big dynamic here we not only have fresh wines but aged wines and there are a lot of people who appreciate what we are doing

8238303 a transfer ncia da zauria adamo n o se trata de retalia o mas sim para refor ar os recursos humanos na direc o da juventude e desportos em algum momento o comportamento dela n o foi elegante pois trabalhou em jeito de criar ratoeiras transferimo la olhando naquilo que a sua compet ncia para al m de que a direc o da juventude e desportos precisava de um refor o no sector dos recursos humanos
8238304 tentei elucidar a governadora sobre a corrup o na minha ex direc o mas ningu m quis me dar ouvido
8238305 pensei que estava a fazer bem denunciar a corrup o em resposta ao apelo do chefe de estado n o sabia que o apelo era uma armadilha contra mim mas n o estou arrependida pois o que denunciei tudo verdade e posso provar a qualquer momento
8238306 quando eu apresentei a exposi o junto da governadora telmina pereira onde levanto quest es de desvio de dinheiro nos antigos combatentes e a resposta disso foi a minha transfer ncia mas em nenhum momento tive oficialmente os resultados apurados pela comiss o de inqu rito que trabalhou no assunto
8238307 eu pergunto ao secret rio permanente quem esse funcion rio que fica inquietado por causa da aplica o da legisla o pois o estatuto regula que os funcion rios devem obedecer a lei
8238308 n o sei se criar condi es na institui o para o estudo da legisla o sendo eu gestora dos recursos humanos estaria a criar ratoeiras para os funcion rios com este posicionamento o secret rio permanente quer dizer que n o se pode aplicar a legisla o
8238309 se n o bato a porta do director n o sou atribu da uma tarefa e o testemunha disso o director tembe que foi transferido para tete a ele tive que exigir at um lugar para me sentar
8238310 entendo que a minha transfer ncia n o passa de uma medida punitiva estou acantonada pois nada fa o por que me receberam na juventude e desportos se n o h condi es para eu trabalhar
8238311 o recrutamento do pessoal significa disponibilidade de condi es para o trabalho
8238312 cheguei junto do chefe de estado porque ao n vel da prov ncia todos dirigentes fizeram ouvido de mercador sobre este assunto pedi para falar com a governadora e n o me atendeu procurei influ ncias dentro de deputados da frelimo no sentido de persuadirem a governadora para me receber mas nada porque o secret rio permanente me fez ver que a legisla o n o deve funcionar na institui ao preferi denunciar o caso durante o com cio popular para ver se chefe de estado resolve o caso
8238313 que tipo de ratoeira um subordinado pode arrumar contra um superior hier rquico pois dever deste contralar actividades dos subordinados n o tenho compet ncias para exarar um despacho de cessa o de fun es ent o se ocorreu um despacho nesse sentido contra um chefe ent o ter ocorrido alguma anormalia
8238314 eu fiz uma carta governadora a narrar os aconteciments da institui o para se corrigir os erros mas nada disso aconteceu e hoje virei r aproximei aos meus superiores hier rquicos e elucidei lhes que a legisla o dita isto um director ou qualquer outro funcion rio n o pode falsificar a idade para se beneficiar de pens o mas eles fizeram ouvidos de mercador n o sou perigosa a legisla o que perigosa pois n o permite o rombo do er rio p blico

8238319 we will drastically cut our diplomatic ties with russia up to consuls or envoys
8238320 but accounting for the fact that a great number of georgians live in russia there would probably be no such decision

8238328 do they really need to be spending money on signs warning that a helicopter may be in the air at a time when taxpayers motorists and apparently local councils are feeling the pinch
8238329 putting these signs up could be counter productive and could lead to more collisions because people are looking at the sky
8238330 essex police is keen to use and develop ideas and strategies that look to address and enhance driver and rider behaviour in an effort to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads and will embrace any idea or strategy that supports that cause

8238341 by political figures who had certainly not looked closely at the banks financial situation
8238342 the true drama is that this cost taxpayers around 10 billion euros
8238343 there is no evidence of rioting or strikes so far but the present unrest could develop into trouble it is the first time the coloured people have ever started putting up a fight for their rights
8238344 recalcitrant stubborn and politically obtuse not very numerous but extremely powerful in the material sense and pretty unscrupulous
8238345 the american tourist dominated bahamian islands represent the most gilbertian picture in the empire the trouble is the absence of any genuine democracy as a consequence the majority of members are elected by the business community which uses its political power for its own commercial ends
8238346 that the meter taxi cab firm is owned and directed by a family with considerable bay street interests and prominent in politics this would have almost certainly ended in a monopoly excluding the taxi cab union entirely
8238347 all of us were ready to go to jail if thats what it took
8238348 the power structure just did not see that the strike was something the people were ready for and did not have to be forced into
8238349 i believe that everyone in every sector had finally had enough and wanted things to change
8238350 the tragedy of it is that all this unnatural hatred has been produced by the greed and avarice of a few men in the community
8238351 little did i know on that sunday morning in january 1958 that the stunning and unexpected aftermath of the general strike would pave the way for the turbulent decade of the sixties ultimately leading to the freedom of majority rule for all bahamians
8238352 the transition from threatened violence and unrest to tranquility and prosperity marks a period which must be regarded as one of the most momentous in the colonys recent history
8238353 but these two years are outstanding not so much for the high level of prosperity as for the far reaching constitutional and legislative changes which were brought about which the general strike had shown to be vital to the progressive development of the colony
8238354 what the btc unions did was a blatant and illegal abuse of power it was a flagrant waste of time money and public resources a disturbance of the peace and a disruption of commerce all in pursuit of a dubious objective
8238355 robert farquharsons attempt to liken his misbegotten demonstration with the 1958 strike and presumably his leadership is simply too ludicrous for words he is no clifford darling mr farquharson and others like him are playing with fire and may well lose public support and leave the union vulnerable to attack by its ideological enemies like the british unions and margaret thatcher
8238356 this whole socioeconomic culture of government monopolies has created a power structure with union bosses making incomes of 100 000 if this nexus of power is taken away it undermines their self interest the btc action was a greedy attempt to hold the nation to ransom using ordinary workers to achieve their selfish ends there is absolutely no similarity with the issues involved in the general strike
8238357 we are not going to suspend the decision on nonmilitary
8238358 we do not have any intention of getting involved in the commercial activities of this private company
8238359 f r fernsehzuschauer die sich einen tollen flachbildschirm gekauft haben ist das ein schwacher trost und f r deutschland als eines der innovativsten l nder der welt ist das ein sehr trauriges bild
8238360 zum start des farbfernsehens gab es auch kaum entsprechende fernsehger te und in den 90er jahren sind viele sender ins digitale fernsehen eingestiegen obwohl es nur wenige digital receiver gab
8238361 allein mit der bandbreite der analogen ausstrahlung von br alpha k nnten die ffentlich rechtlichen sender bis zu vier hd sender ausstrahlen
8238362 les hicimos una oferta que aumentaba la anterior que mejoraba el b sico y el salario inicial
8238363 propusimos llegar a un b sico de 780 pesos para que mejore la antig edad la ruralidad y los plus porque eso genera una fuerte suba pero no s lo que no encontramos aceptaci n sino tampoco una contrapropuesta
8238364 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8238365 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8238366 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8238367 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8238368 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8238369 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8238370 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8238371 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and tsvangirai form a transitional government
8238372 unfortunate events have taken place in orissa in recent days these began with the senseless killing of hindu swami laxmanananda saraswati on aug 23 i am disappointed by the false claim that christians have responsibility for this murder and i am saddened by the atrocities being visited on christians in orissa
8238373 all christian villages are empty in kandhamal as christians old and young sick and pregnant mothers are hiding in forests exposed to the non stop monsoon rains without food
8238374 we are all under immense danger and threat from these groups please continue to uphold us in your prayer particularly for the safety of christian brothers and sisters who are now hiding themselves in jungles
8238375 i appeal to the governing authorities in india to intervene to save the lives of the many who are being victimized in the current crisis
8238376 respect for the principle of religious liberty and the sacredness of human life requires nothing less i also appeal to all baptists worldwide to pray gods protection for our brothers and sisters in orissa
8238377 now we have no request except prayer from our baptist world as we do not know how to face tomorrow
8238378 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
8238379 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8238380 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8238381 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8238382 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8238383 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8238384 if there was an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold they want another four year term to continue to alienate our allies spend our childrens inheritance and hollow out our economy
8238385 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8238386 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8238387 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8238388 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8238389 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8238390 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8238404 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8238405 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8238406 i do not know when that day will come i wish mdc leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8238407 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate
8238408 he should wait for the conclusion of the dialogue together with the mdc and mr tsvangirai on the way forward otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8238409 the talks have not been formally terminated so the natural conclusion is that the talks are on
8238410 but there hasnt been any formal communication from sadc from president mbeki to say this is the way forward
8238411 we are actually looking forward to the conclusion of the dialogue when mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai form a transitional government

8238418 i cant believe i said id do this shoot when i havent been able to exercise for almost eight weeks
8238419 i looked on while the dog peed on the floor
8238420 as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
8238421 if you use while in place of although be sure theres no chance it could be misunderstood to mean during the time that you could leave the impression that unlikely things were happening at the same time as in while dopey sleeps late he enjoys vigorous exercise only if dopey is a sleepwalker

8238424 das design dieses usb sticks finde ich wirklich genial das einzige was mich von einem
8238425 die haben nicht nur ein gestell entwickelt die haben sogar 2 entwickelt
8238426 das ist wirklich alt ich hab die dinger weihnachten 2006 geschenkt bekommen
8238427 auf dem bild ist nicht viel zu erkennen aber die neuen motorola razr haben soweit ich es
8238428 das tolle am ultraschall ist ja gerade dass er so hochfrequent ist dass menschen ihn
8238429 its a huge relief shes a fantastic filly and its great to see her back
8238430 she pulled up a bit sore after her debut and they found a small chip in her knee so we had that removed and gave her three months off
8238431 she had a slight temperature and she missed the race
8238432 we were a little bit worried there but shes all right now and we jump onto the back of the princess series in the flight stakes
8238433 but im not sure where well go between now and then with her
8238434 she got absolutely smashed and was a little bit rattled after the race but it was just one of those races you just forget they went around
8238435 ill sit down and discuss it with jockey corey brown and see what he thinks about getting that trip because the horse switched off a little bit in the closing stages today but overall it was a solid effort
8238436 sirmione will run in the memsie for sure but viewed might wait another week and run in the bobbie lewis quality at flemington if he doesnt run on saturday
8238437 we dont know yet well see how he works and pulls up in the morning
8238438 sirmione has been in work longer than viewed and viewed may not get a run
8238439 sirmione always runs well first up but with the rail out 11 metres its a bit of a worry for the backmarkers
8238440 im happy with them all baci and emperor have both drawn badly in 12 and 13 and that will make things a bit harder but theyll still be in there with good chances
8238441 particularly baci hes a real surprise packet and keeps getting better i wouldnt put anything past him
8238442 hes pulled up well and done very well since the run and i think hell run a big race
8238443 his run was a very good one but i dont think the track suited him
8238444 i came here with six runners in five races and i honestly thought i can win with five
8238445 but i won with two had a second and two thirds and the other earned a prizemoney cheque by finishing fourth so im still happy
8238446 when she first came to us she didnt settle in and she fractured her nose playing up one day
8238447 she failed in her first run for me at the gold coast in may last year but she never raced for a year by the time she had a spell and then the break caused by ei equine influenza
8238448 she won first up at the gold coast in june and now shes unbeaten in four runs this time in
8238449 sono molto felice di essere qui a venezia e non ho mai pensato di andare ad una convention dove le star devono essere i politici

8238454 da tempo cercavo di lavorare con loro quindi sono stato ben lieto di accettare quando mi hanno chiamato ma quando ho capito che la parte era scritta per me non ero pi sicuro di sentirmi lusingato o insultato
8238455 ho ancora questa incertezza ma stato divertente lavorare con loro come divertente essere qui oggi
8238456 dobbiamo assolutamente porre rimedio ad una situazione insostenibile e un dovere morale verso le nuove generazioni rivedere completamente il sistema scuola in italia
8238457 quando la spesa per il personale ha una tale incidenza sul bilancio complessivo del ministero questo significa che la nostra scuola non ha la capacit se non si interviene strutturalmente di rinnovarsi e di guardare con serenit al futuro

8238503 never underestimate what you dont know due diligence is a balance between cost time and risk
8238504 im not up on the economy dont know much about industry really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class but i know that one and one is two and if i could be just like you what a wonderful world this would be
8238505 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
8238506 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
8238507 people see the value of their homes fall at the same time that the price of gasoline and food is rising already tight household budgets are getting tighter
8238508 may not be the expert that some people are on foreign policy but i did stay in a holiday inn express last night
8238509 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
8238510 the issue of economics is something that ive really never understood as well as i should
8238511 ive never been involved in wall street ive never been involved in the financial stuff the financial workings of the country so id like to have somebody intimately familiar with it
8238512 if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice
8238513 that characterized the truman administration with marshall and acheson and kennan
8238514 the first president bush with people like scowcroft and powell and baker
8238515 leading with our values and ideals and not just with our military
8238516 shy away from being straight with the russians about human rights violations
8238517 and that kind of tough thoughtful realistic diplomacy used to be a bipartisan hallmark of u s foreign policy
8238518 it is time for a total change in washingtons worldview
8238519 that will require more than a great soldier it will require a wise leader
8238520 if you do not attempt to change the status quo by negotiations theres only one option
8238521 actually two options left status quo bogged down for decades losing our blood and treasure or war if john mccain has ruled out talking that means were going to get more of what weve had for most of the bush administration or worse
8238522 instead of regime change we should focus on conduct change it also requires a more sophisticated understanding that by publicly engaging iran including through direct talks we can exploit cracks within the ruling elite and between irans rulers and its people who are struggling economically and stifled politically
8238523 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8238524 mccain has a long record of doing that barack obama doesnt
8238525 gustav should pass between jamaica and the southeastern coast of cuba on thursday
8238526 the two hijackers and the crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8238527 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8238528 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8238529 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8238530 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8238531 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8238532 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8238533 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8238534 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8238538 i think she did what she had to do but i didnt feel any enthusiasm
8238539 what it did was it reminded us how incredibly strong a candidate she still is on that stage
8238540 but hillarys speech reminded me that im not a republican and im not excited about voting republican tonight reminded me that i am still a democrat at heart
8238541 you never gave in and you never gave up and together we made history
8238542 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8238543 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8238544 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8238545 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8238546 youre not going to undo a months long primary campaign with one speech but its a beginning
8238547 you think theyre going to go for obama you think theyre going to go with schumer whos against drilling in the arctic and offshore
8238548 and we know why were republican because the democrats have opposed our development every inch of the way biden voted against the oil pipeline five times
8238549 an internet was sent by my staff at 10 oclock in the morning on friday and i just got it yesterday why
8238550 because it got tangled up with all these things going on the internet commercially
8238551 they want to deliver vast amounts of information over the internet and again the internet is not something you just dump something on its not a truck
8238552 no we dont suppose thats going to happen any time soon
8238553 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
8238554 why do we keep and bear arms mr elder takes us from the beginning to modern day times in what leaders of the world including hitler had to say about an armed citizenry
8238555 the peaceable part of mankind will be continually overrun by the vile and abandoned while they neglect the means of self defense weakness allures the ruffian but arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world horrid mischief would ensue were the good deprived of the use of them the weak will become a prey to the strong

8238565 t his is not a right granted by the constitution neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence the second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed
8238566 s urely a most familiar meaning is as the constitutions second amendment
8238567 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state
8238568 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
8238569 if it was widely agreed upon the definition of the second amendment and was so rarely interpreted through law and referred to in writings after ratification not differently then how did we reach a point of banning ownership of guns without being challenged in the u s supreme court until now
8238570 in the absence of any evidence tending to show that the possession or use of a shortbarreled shotgun at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say that the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument
8238571 it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense
8238572 as incredible as it sounds that 90 of americans reject the lieberman warner plans costs the actual number who reject it may be even higher electricity and gasoline price hikes are only two of the costs of this proposal
8238573 the price for food and consumer goods would also be pushed higher and many americans would lose their jobs you cant merely accept energy price increases and opt out of all the other costs
8238574 as amazing as it is that 90 of the public agrees on anything
8238575 is the fact that all three of the major prudential candidates senators clinton mccain and obama favor a proposal the public appears to be almost unanimously against
8238576 theres been a robust debate over which economic analysis is accurate proponents believe that lower range cost estimates strengthen their case for approval of the plan while opponents believe higher range cost estimates strengthen the case against it that debate turns out to be irrelevant
8238577 americans oppose warner lieberman no matter which study is closer to the mark just 6 would be willing to accept the gasoline and electricity price increase ranges forecast by any of the three studies
8238578 this puts us in a gaping hole the size of the grand canyon
8238579 its a bad day for the cranston schools it really is
8238580 the little bastard will bite the end of your finger off
8238581 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

8238585 american employees must be punctual dress appropriately and have good personal hygiene
8238586 they need anger management and conflict resolution skills and they have to be able to accept direction too many young people bristle when a supervisor asks them to do something
8238587 i just wish our government would close the borders permanently ship all muslims out and find and deport all illegals i know i am a dreamer but i can hope
8238588 i am very proud to be able to bring jobs to the us and think the cost of 7 l1 transfers to be a small immigration price to create 21 more jobs for us citizens here
8238589 this car was only driven by a little old lady been just sitting in the garage and maintained regularly normally this would sell for 30 000 but just for you and today only 29 999
8238590 these f ing jews have taken our jobs we need them out of the country

8238598 russia has the potential to become the largest internet user market in europe its a huge market with fantastic growth every day more and more people in russia are discovering the internet
8238599 we have better technology and understanding of the market i take the competition seriously and every day check the latest figures to see where it is but i think we will stay far ahead what was enough for google to conquer other markets isnt enough in russia
8238600 in two years since google opened an office in russia we havent lost a single specialist to our competitors because yandex is one of the best companies to work for in russia
8238601 ironically my first business experience was thanks to the communist party
8238602 when the law about kooperativ was passed our boss at the institute came to us and said you guys are mathematicians you start a business we began trading computers and i was made technical director i was only 24 we were paid in hardware instead of cash and i earned two personal computers in one year a huge sum in those days enough to buy my first flat a two bedroom moscow apartment
8238603 we have brilliant mathematicians and programmers we are very strong on data analysis and have developed better technology which is cutting edge in russia we are constantly inventing new programs to stay ahead
8238604 im very proud of the fact that we have created something so successful out of nothing but above all a great brand that sends a positive signal about russia and that says something about the great talent there is here

8238643 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
8238644 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
8238645 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
8238646 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains

8238658 the pads last whistle blow is unjustified unnecessary provocative and illegal

8238660 even if he managed to get 30 mps it has to be of the correct distribution in terms of the malay muslims and non malay muslims
8238661 it has to be in such a way that it wont upset the malay muslims who are dominant in pakatan rakyat anwars coalition otherwise pas may leave or something
8238662 i think the main contents of his anwars policies are sound and they do make sense economically over the long run because it should have a positive impact on malaysias competitiveness
8238663 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies

8238670 barack obama is mijn kandidaat en hij moet onze president worden
8238671 of jullie voor mij of voor barack hebben gestemd het is nu tijd om ons te verenigen in n partij met n doel wij zijn hetzelfde team
8238672 de belofte van ons land en de hoop van ons volk verspilt
8238673 dat waren de redenen dat ik in de race was voor hetpresidentschap dat zijn de redenen dat ik nu barack obama steun en dat zijn de redenen dat jullie dat ook moeten doen
8238674 deze inschatting heeft zij op geen enkele manier gewijzigd miljoenen amerikanen blijven bezorgd over de vraag of barack obama klaar is om president te zijn
8238675 als obama wint wordt haar speech herinnerd als een hoffelijk gebaar van een rivale die heeft verloren als hij verliest wordt het misschien ge nterpreteerd als haar eerste speech van de presidentsverkiezingen van 2012
8238676 a lot of flights have been cut because of the fuel price problem
8238677 the purpose of this is to provide a consistent passenger experience
8238678 if some airline comes in and needs a lot of gates weve got them
8238679 i did start out by saying that as everybody knows i supported obama much to the chagrin of many people in the room i said it was a very hard fought election and then i segued into the fact that in 2003 i had one of my own in fact it was a really difficult race in which there were a lot of hard feelings on both sides
8238680 it made my trip out here this is a big deal
8238681 i thought that was a very poignant moment because thats an example of how if democrats come together especially in kentucky where we have 1 7 democrats for every republican then democrats cant lose elections
8238682 enjoyed working with congressman chandler on key issues and looks forward to continuing that bipartisan relationship
8238683 leadership from a mayoral chair denotes not only everyday activities as far as fixing things but its seeking out opportunities for expansion in business and industry in going in being accessible having good communication skills to not only seek new businesses and industry but to retain new businesses and industry

8238772 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8238773 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a byword for brilliance
8238774 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8238775 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8238776 cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and i am sure rickys speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person
8238777 sir donalds life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that our strong sport continues to grow stronger

8238782 i already know hes going to do good hes very smart
8238783 we need to give him every opportunity to see if he can take us a long way
8238784 again this kid hes very smart he can run he can make all the throws he just hasnt played that much yet but this summer i think he has accepted the fact that hes the quarterback and i think hes done a pretty good job of getting the guys organized throwing the ball around and giving him a chance to develop as the leader of the offense
8238785 thats just the way its been were going to give tommy beecher a chance to run with it
8238786 i know whats expected of me and if i cant get the offense to move at all coach spurrier has been known to have a short leash
8238787 thats to be expected we have to have a quarterback out there thats moving the ball ill be prepared to play and just hope for the best
8238788 its been well documented what kind of young man tommy is
8238789 i think that will help our team i hope it rubs off on the other players he certainly does have a chance to be a quarterback whos a leader because of the way he handles himself and so forth
8238790 he made a lot of mistakes in some scrimmages but i think he improved as we went
8238791 we can see it in the practices better decision making he hasnt played a lot in the games we need to wait until the live action starts flying around here
8238792 hes just a cool dude i guess being behind blake and smelley last year really humbled him hes showing a lot of confidence now hes making the big throws and big plays that we all believe he will make in the game
8238793 i have complete confidence in them that theyll make plays for me and i hope they do have confidence that i can get the ball to them
8238794 i have a pretty easy job getting the ball to them
8238795 this season should be the season i really show what im capable of doing
8238796 my goal is to make a lot of big plays and a lot of big hits just look out im trying to bring all the heat this year
8238797 thats the way most people describe the way i play because i go 100 percent
8238798 some folks symbolized that as a ball of hate because of the way i run to the ball im ok with it
8238799 ive been through a lot and overcame a lot everything ive gone through ive tried to learn something from that
8238800 by the grace of god im still here playing and pushing on ive come a long way and i still have a long way to go
8238801 just stay prayed up and continue to have faith in god and let him lead my way
8238802 hes got his head on straight and he works hard on his academics its a struggle to go to college as a student athlete and then you throw having a family on top of that there were some times that were disappointing but hes growing up hes going to be a good player for us
8238803 expect a strong healthy tray blackmon playing hard every game
8238804 my goal is definitely to make a lot of plays and contribute to the team i want to get through a whole season without injury i feel real good right now coming out of camp i have some little nicks and bruises but nothing major i feel 100 percent
8238805 we plan to win every game we play and take it all the way
8238806 i know we have some hard games but i think this will be one of the best teams auburn has had in a while were all level headed guys and on the same page and i think this team could be something special
8238807 were unique for our fans in that we have three huge rivalries
8238808 to me we even take it a step further i always say your rivalries are your league games because thats your goal every year to win a conference championship

8238825 what am i going to do for 60 grand its going to have to be more than a peck on the cheek
8238826 i think youre a disgrace youre a disgrace to the fashion industry how can you call yourself a professor
8238827 we were driving and i asw this picture of you it was realyl big
8238828 marlon ive just been sent this script for the brian jones story im meant to play anita
8238829 as a consequence i had to find myself a new gp and after becoming a new patient i attend to have some routine tests for cholesterol and diabetes
8238830 unbeknown to me the nurse who gave me those tests ticked the box for a psa test which is a blood test which establishes if theres a problem with the prostate gland
8238831 that test normally takes place if a patient has symptoms of prostate disease or if a patient has heard about a psa test and requests a test
8238832 in my case i was a new patient and the nurse made a mistake
8238833 i basically owe my life to that nurse and i went back and i told her that weeks afterwards because that test found a high psa which was then investigated further
8238834 as i recovered from that i started to wonder how i could pay back some of the good things that happened
8238835 earlier this year i decided to try to put in place a support group of the type i would have wished for
8238836 i was desperate i would really have liked to spoken to someone who had had surgery and someone who had had radiotherapy but that was not a possibility
8238837 one of the aims of the group is to make men and their families more aware of the dangers of prostate cancer
8238838 the test is there the important thing is to raise awareness of that because the nhs will not screen men routinely
8238839 we advise people if there is a history of prostate cancer to request the test earlier but general speaking at 50 to go along and have the test
8238840 prostate cancer in the early stages has no symptoms yet it is at that stage it can be treated more successfully
8238841 quando la spesa per il personale ha una tale incidenza sul bilancio complessivo del ministero ha commentato il ministro mariastella gelmini questo significa che la nostra scuola non ha la capacit se non si interviene strutturalmente di rinnovarsi e di guardare con serenit al futuro dobbiamo assolutamente porre rimedio ad una situazione insostenibile la scuola italiana stata troppo spesso usata in passato come un ammortizzatore sociale e un dovere morale verso le nuove generazioni rivedere completamente il sistema scuola in italia

8238843 weak banks should be allowed to disappear from the market
8238844 a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system
8238845 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8238846 after the german economy began the year with a bang that was to be expected i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction
8238847 domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated but this weakness will be temporary
8238848 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8238849 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8238850 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8238851 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8238852 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8238853 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8238854 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8238855 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8238856 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8238857 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8238858 im sad that were not standing here talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8238859 previously our recommendation was based on a first half u s recession and continued economic growth in europe and emerging markets these assumptions are no longer reasonable
8238860 the european market has seen two months of lower light vehicle sales with talk of significant production cuts china also seems to be headed to a downturn with the slowest pace of wholesale shipments in over three years
8238861 this was a challenging quarter to drive top line sales predominantly due to the change in our talbots brand annual june clearance strategy coupled with a difficult macro environment
8238862 while a year over year shortfall in retail sales impacted the quarter results were largely offset by the talbots brand merchandise gross margin expansion
8238863 however given the heavy inventory position of the j jill brand we took aggressive markdowns during the quarter which hurt gross margin and our second quarter total company operating performance
8238864 terminated all discussions in relation to financing for a possible offer and that gfk will therefore not be pursuing an offer for tns
8238865 were glad that gfk has clarified its position at last
8238866 we are ready to allot another 50 acres of land adjacent to the 900 acres of land already given to tata in dharwad
8238867 i am working now on a structure which i can be directly involved with for the development of other shooters and athletes i will actually try and groom people for the future i am in the process of starting off with a shooting plan
8238868 i will give more details on that when i have finalised the plan and things are a bit more concrete
8238869 i have not planned how to use it but i will certainly spend a portion of it on the development of olympic sports in the country
8238870 i want to use this time now when people are willing to listen to my opinion for the greater good of indian sport and actually go out there and make a difference
8238871 i would like to give back to not only shooting but also to the whole indian sport movement i would like to offer my help to all who seek it and also like to be available to other shooters so that i can share my experience with them
8238872 for the usual comment about how india underperforms it is very simple we dont have any sport structure whatsoever so the fact that we are even winning a couple of medals is phenomenal it is time we all join hands and try and change this acceptance of mediocrity
8238873 i think we should all be positive and actually offer solutions since it is pretty obvious we all know the problems
8238874 it is important that we do this in a team effort where the more the merrier and only when we all join hands can there be a change for the better in the indian system
8238875 performing at the top level always isnt really fun there is so much pressure to perform expectations to live up to facing your fears and doubts and yet one had to find a way out
8238876 it is certainly the pinnacle of my sporting career but i wont call it a turning point the turning point was the whole journey when i put in my everything to achieve my goal
8238877 olympic is a different experience altogether there is a greater aura around it as it is the greatest spectacle on the earth but the world championships is a tougher competition worlds best shooters participate there it is hard to answer
8238878 it is in 2010 which is still a long way
8238879 with the skud class making its debut to the games in september we are delighted to be taking a larger number of sailors to the games to contend for more medals than ever before and we hope to see the squad live up to sailings reputation in britain as one of the countrys most successful sports
8238880 these six sailors although a mix of youth and experience are all proven performers at elite disabled sailing events on the world stage and represent great britains strongest chance of success in qingdao in 2008 while at the same time building towards a successful home games at weymouth and portland in 2012
8238881 that can happen when you are 1 0 down on a set piece but the way we conceded it it was a special game where we knew it was important not to concede a goal on a set piece
8238882 and we didnt manage to come back which is unusual for us
8238883 its an absolutely must win game we have to bounce back to victory before welcoming newcastle because our group is getting better and better as soon as we win
8238884 as a consequence we are going to play this game to win despite the difficulties we faced against this team in the first leg
8238885 we are competitors winners but we didnt show it at fulham
8238886 we failed to create a threat we conceded a goal from a corner and paid for the mistake

8239151 that is unless you live in apartment 3l at 1254 holden st you watched money train on tbs last night at 3 a m and your name is nate walsh
8239152 i have always said that the change we seek will not come easy that it will not come without its share of sacrifice and struggle
8239153 and the last thing we need is dead weight like nate walsh adding another 20 or 30 years to the process
8239154 when i began this campaign my mission was to help this nation share my vision for one america not a black america or a white america or a latino or asian america
8239155 but now what i see what i envision is a nate free america and once we get rid of that guy there is nothing we cant accomplish nothing we cant achieve
8239156 i am reminded of an instance early last year when nate told his sister elizabeth that he was going to start going to the gym three times a week after work
8239157 i was rooting for nate i thought that this time things would be different that this time nate would be capable of change but it was just like 1997 1999 2000 and 2002 all over again he went to the gym twice and quit
8239158 people of america not nate we have the ability to heal this nation
8239159 yes we can nate excluded seize our future yes we can with the exception of nate and his stupid cargo shorts that he never washes turn the page to a new tomorrow i am confident that where we and by we i mean everyone but nate are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we cant we again not nate will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in six simple words yes we can except nate walsh

8239203 lets face it both brothers like to drink to unconsciousness
8239204 men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been
8239205 guilt which refers to criminal responsibility for a criminal action try it another way the rapist is not culpable for the rape he is guilty of it the victim may or may not be partly culpable for creating the conditions in which the rapist could strike
8239206 would you have been any less deserving of sympathy if you had been drunk and someone had mugged or injured you
8239207 whatever language you choose to use it is blatantly obvious that you are placing a degree of responsibility with the victim of rape who is drunk
8239208 even though you say quite clearly and unequivocally that rapists are entirely responsible for their actions whether their victims are drunk or sober i will nonetheless conclude that you mean the opposite of what you say and too bad
8239209 are women supposed to expect that all men are rapists who will rape as soon the opportunity is there
8239210 what if a drunk woman goes home with a man she is friends with is it still her fault if she gets raped
8239211 it is reasonable to expect that women as sexual beings should be able to express sexual availability and interact as active rather than passive sexual beings asking them to do otherwise to avoid rape is like asking people to stay indoors after 6pm to avoid being mugged or asking men to stay celibate in order to avoid false rape accusations on pain of any compensation being cut its not reasonable in a way that say asking people not to scream abuse at strangers who might thump them is or say asking men who drink half a bottle of wine a night to keep their counsel about who the drunken idiot is might be
8239212 consent consent is defined as the act of willingly and verbally agreeing to engage in specific sexual conduct the following are clarifying points consent is required each and every time there is sexual activity all parties must have a clear and accurate understanding of the sexual activity the person s who initiate s the sexual activity is responsible for asking for consent the person s who are asked are responsible for verbally responding each new level of sexual activity requires consent use of agreed upon forms of communication such as gestures or safe words is acceptable but must be discussed and verbally agreed to by all parties before sexual activity occurs consent is required regardless of the parties relationship prior sexual history or current activity e g grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity at any and all times when consent is withdrawn or not verbally agreed to the sexual activity must stop immediately silence is not consent body movements and non verbal responses such as moans are not consent a person can not give consent while sleeping all parties must have unimpaired judgement examples that may cause impairment include but are not limited to alcohol drugs mental health conditions physical health conditions 2 all parties must use safer sex practices all parties must disclose personal risk factors and any known stis individuals are responsible for maintaining awareness of their sexual health these requirements for consent do not restrict with whom the sexual activity may occur the type of sexual activity that occurs the props toys tools that are used the number of persons involved the gender s or gender expressions of persons involved
8239213 tamara compared being drunk a voluntary act with being mentally ill which is involuntary
8239214 so a man or woman who is killed whilst walking down a street at night is responsible for putting themselves in a dangerous situation
8239215 im sick of men trying to blame women because they cant admit to the fact that a large proportion of men are sexual predators
8239216 write it in fire across the night some men are more or less all right
8239217 where in this article is any blame apportioned to the rapist
8239218 men who take advantage of women by raping them drunk or sober should be severely punished for this wicked treacherous action however stupid the victim may have been
8239219 the comments agreeing with peter make me so sad as a young girl i see now all men want to rape me and are waiting for the moment to do this this makes me never want to date or marry men are all just potential monsters

8239237 just a few months ago the situation in cyprus came to table while kosovos independence was being discussed
8239238 why the same respect which is being shown to kosovos choice for self determination is not being shown to turks living in the north of the cyprus who have their own flag lands border and administration
8239239 it will be inevitable that the turkish republic of northern cyprus issue would be sound more loudly with south ossetia and abkhazias independence struggle which was being whispered during the process of kosovos independence
8239240 when our troops advanced on august 7 in south ossetias capital tskhinval we all had the impression that the americans or the british would provide assistance the russians sent their tanks into south ossetia the next day and within hours we were driven out by russian forces that advanced on into georgian territory outside south ossetia

8239255 now i want to see how we recover from the hard work every game has its difficulties and the game against numancia will have its own too
8239256 we have to learn from these defeats because now the league is beginning and we wantt o make a good start
8239257 we have carried out a pre season campaign that was designed to prepare us for the season but also to ensure that we qualified for the champions league 2 he continued
8239258 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8239259 its a tough moment she clearly felt she was the right person for the job and she didnt get it
8239260 so she has to come out there and do everything she can to persuade her people that theyve got to come together and that a divided party is a defeated party
8239261 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8239262 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front
8239263 i think the democrats understand just how tough this is going to be
8239264 clearly the american people are now looking back and saying what else is there i think its going to be a tough challenge for sen obama and hes got to do it over the next couple of days the democrats have really got to put more meat on the bone and let people know why they should win and sen mccain should lose
8239265 if you listen to all the speeches up to sen clintons speech they were full of talk about the need to stop jobs from being taken overseas

8239270 el club me tiene en gran estima y cuando me lo han vuelto a demostrar con esa claridad eso es lo m s grande para un futbolista y por eso he decidido no pensar en nada m s que seguir aqu este club es el que me ha abierto las puertas siempre y espero devolverle su apoyo en el campo

8239272 my optimism about new signings gets less the nearer we get to the deadline
8239273 if we dont then we will have to soldier on with what we have but hopefully we will still get a couple in
8239274 if we dont get anyone in then well have to wait for our strikers to get fit but we have six strikers out at the moment and mark viduka obafemi martins and damien duff are all going to be out for three or four weeks were stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment
8239275 james has a three year contract with us at the moment
8239276 i dont even want to talk about losing james milner
8239277 hes a very important player for us and i think hes worthy of a call up to the senior england side hes been too long in the under 21s once youve played 30 odd games for the under 21s you deserve a crack at the big time

8239285 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8239286 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8239287 these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8239288 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8239289 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8239290 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8239291 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8239292 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8239293 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8239294 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8239295 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8239296 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8239297 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8239298 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8239299 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8239300 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8239301 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8239302 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8239303 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8239304 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8239305 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8239306 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8239307 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8239308 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8239309 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8239310 we saw no cars when we arrived today and were wondering if something happened
8239311 i tried to stay in close because sharks are less likely to be there

8239313 wishes to conduct ms riggs examination because we understand she has information regarding lusters assets and liabilities including funds which may be owed to him
8239314 they feel its their last chance in their lifetime to see a woman president
8239315 she said everything and did everything anyone could possibly do in terms of talking both to her supporters and to barack obama supporters
8239316 the media are making a mountain out of a mole hill
8239317 im as determined a hillary clinton supporter as youll find but i am enthusiastically behind obama
8239318 we have to end the years of republican authoritarian rule
8239319 i dont know when a woman will win but it certainly is time
8239320 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects
8239321 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one

8239333 a woman may not like to talk dirty because it takes her away from her body and sensations
8239334 but she might really like it if you talk dirty to her
8239335 i wonder what itd be like if you took the lead tonight that would really turn me on

8239341 they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8239342 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8239343 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8239344 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8239345 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8239346 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8239347 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8239348 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8239349 private insurance has been falling and public insurance definitely went up
8239350 the number of uninsured is considerably higher than when the president took office and in each year since then employer sponsored insurance has continued to diminish
8239351 i think its more like we are seeing a tide that i dont think anybody can easily fix particularly in the small business sector

8239354 imagine if we had a government that would give us broad based tax cuts to increase cash flow and help consumer spending in troubled times
8239355 imagine if we had a government to would provide substantial direct financial help for families to offset increasing energy costs
8239356 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this

8239362 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand

8239365 the united states has no illusions about the regime in pyongyang
8239366 the united states is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8239367 north korea does not care whether it continues remaining on the list of those countries which are disobedient to the united states
8239368 analysts in south korea said tuesdays angry statement by the north fits a familiar pattern of negotiation by fist shaking
8239369 this is quite an expected reaction from north korea given that not much has happened since they symbolically exploded the cooling tower

8239603 i was proud of our ability to rapidly mobilize and deploy to the louisiana superdome prior to flooding
8239604 we saved thousands of lives by providing security at the dome along with distribution of mres and bottled water and played an integral part in moving persons from the dome
8239605 from there we were on point of the convoy providing mres military meals ready to eat and water to persons at the morial convention center
8239606 we secured the msr main supply route for the transports formed distribution points and subsequently directed and oversaw an immediate and timely evacuation of all persons from that venue
8239607 we performed a law and order mission in high visibility areas such as the french quarter the new orleans central business district where we demonstrated great readiness reliability and relevance as a military police battalion during the most difficult of circumstances
8239608 the most important part of being a battalion commander in iraq is taking care of soldiers and maintaining the values of the army i serve and the values of the great men and women that i serve with which are loyalty duty respect selfless service honor integrity and personal courage

8239610 the other day a brave young man from this battalion died near here
8239611 i know who he was and i know the name to be etched on a concrete grave marker i consider the name and life that one day will be forgotten by all but the ones who loved him and or knew him i wondered as i signed a letter to his spouse as i have before about these soldiers some who look like children and some who do not and about a mother or father or wife or friend who on a clear morning in the calm of their home were struck with the pain of learning that someone they love isnt there anymore my duty as battalion commander to soldiers is my greatest challenge and one that i will always embrace
8239612 this units very recent loss of a great soldier father and son relates on a personal level to me
8239613 my most vital sources of support are faith family friends and my fellow soldiers
8239614 i believe in the power of prayer and take strength from it spending time with my eight year old son and ten year old daughter always makes me happy i love the laughter of and smile upon my little boys and girls face

8239625 after all the talk this week about the clintons can you imagine how happy democrats would be about a republican revolt in st paul about john mccains choice for vp
8239626 its an attack ad it attacks me personally its nasty its mean spirited frankly it tells you more about sen mccain than it does about me that he would run an ad like that
8239627 i must admit that the mccain ad was well it was reminiscent of what he did against george w bush in 2000 which is you recall he accused president bush of twisting the truth like bill clinton and again this is the kind of nasty personal attack which really doesnt have a place in this process
8239628 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do

8239632 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8239633 its absurd and disingenuous for the obama campaign to say we are running this ad they are trying to blame us and use a straw man to take this issue off the table if he thinks having a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist is not an issue that concerns the american people he is deluding himself or being naive

8239677 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8239678 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8239679 however should such an offer be received then the club would be forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave

8239685 in addition to the dedicated team of over 30 detectives who are working in these cases we have increased high visibility police patrols around workington to reassure the community and provide a visible presence
8239686 it is extremely rare for two incidents of this nature to occur just over a mile apart in an area such as workington and we are devoting significant resources to catching those responsible
8239687 following inspection of the affected boilers a thorough cleaning process is underway
8239688 if all aspects of this process are successful then we will be able to give further clarification on when the plant will resume production
8239689 i dont believe the proposal is in the best interests of tenants
8239690 at the time we took it through the transfer of council houses to carlisle housing association in 2002 there was an awful lot this council did to make absolutely sure that tenants were involved
8239691 there was a vote in favour of transfer i dont believe this proposal is in the spirit of the transfer agreement im not in favour
8239692 i would like more information about the consultation with tenants and the responses to that
8239693 at present rental income is used for the betterment of the housing stock in carlisle im not certain
8239694 i realised what i did was bang out of order and we were taking it back when the police caught us
8239695 i still cannot believe this happened we were only a few minutes late because a rides queue hadnt been moving and then the ride lasted longer than we thought
8239696 we ran back to the bus zone as quickly as we could but we were seven minutes late at first i wasnt worried because the bus driver had said he would wait 10 extra minutes but soon i realised he had gone and left us
8239697 who leaves a bunch of kids in an unfamiliar area
8239698 alton towers is based in the middle of nowhere on a dark country road anything could have happened
8239699 the kids shouldnt have been late but if the coach company is willing to take teenagers on trips they should be prepared to give them a bit of leeway especially when youre only talking seven minutes
8239700 youd think in this day and age that people would look after the younger people in the community
8239701 there are strict policies that the bus driver has to follow so he had to leave them
8239702 the driver needed to get back up to carlisle before his driving hours were used up there are tight working regulations for coach drivers so we have to keep to a strict schedule the driver waited for five minutes before setting off
8239703 it was the drivers first day doing those sorts of trips usually the coach drivers should say be back for 5 15pm so they can leave at 5 30pm
8239704 we didnt know he was that young but even so he isnt too young to get back on time
8239705 ive suggested this to dobbies and they seem quite keen and the bus company are reasonably receptive
8239706 there is a shortage of parking spaces in the square because pensioners from outlying areas are leaving their cars there while they pick up a free bus to carlisle
8239707 we would welcome the opportunity to discuss such a facility as i can see that there could be some benefits for all parties concerned
8239708 we do have additional land within our ownership outwith the application site and it may be that this could come into play
8239709 at around 6 45pm yesterday police received reports that two men had damaged a car belonging to the family of the 22 year old man who was stabbed during an incident in wigton officers attended the scene of the damage then arrested two males in the crosby villa area
8239710 a 15 year old male from aspatria was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder a 33 year old man from carlisle was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation assisting an offender drink driving criminal damage making threats to cause damage and resisting arrest
8239711 both males are in custody and are helping police with their inquiries
8239712 its really to try and stop any criminal activity taking place in the first place
8239713 if the operators can see a problem brewing they can make the perpetrators aware that they are being followed
8239714 it will act as a deterrent and hopefully they wont follow it through

8239771 i dont see anybody out there who is better we need him in washington i dont think we can afford to lose him there
8239772 i think the reason that both candidates are not making fundamental suggestions is that they are not really sure how much its going to cost and they are not sure how it is going to run up against other priorities like rescuing the economy short term
8239773 there is just going to have to be a lot bailouts of the financial system and thats going to cost a huge amount of money
8239774 this is a stay awake at night issue for american families and there has not been a lot of attention played against it

8239777 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this

8239779 we play so good over all when you win you should give your speech in english

8239784 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8239785 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8239786 everybody was tired of hearing about it so they finally had to step up and do something to make a change
8239787 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8239788 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8239789 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8239790 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8239791 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8239792 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8239793 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8239794 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8239795 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8239796 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing

8239803 but by and large they are not willing to pay for it
8239804 at the moment we still dont know what the schedule of the weekend will be
8239805 we go there we havent tested we dont have any idea its going to be a night race its going to be the rainy season so its not exactly what you really want from a safety point of view

8239858 it was not our understanding that they were just going to give the job to jay we in no way thought that we knew he would have to win the job
8239859 while no one promised him the job we were under the impression he would be given a better opportunity to win it if theyre going to base it off two days of kicking they probably shouldnt have signed him it makes no sense to make a decision about jay without letting him kick in the preseason game
8239860 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8239861 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8239862 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8239863 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8239864 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8239865 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8239866 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8239867 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears
8239868 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
8239869 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
8239870 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rates in children and for the fall in uninsured rates in the general population
8239871 but when you look at whats really going on the number of uninsured dropped by 1 3 million and the increase in coverage under medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip went up by 1 3 million
8239872 you just see the difference the new massachusetts health reform plan has made in improving coverage
8239873 45 7 million people who are uninsured is still a major problem there is no cause for celebration that we only have 45 7 million uninsured there is still a very serious problem the most serious problem we have in the health sector
8239874 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large

8239878 many traditional indian practitioners believe quite strongly that if rasa shastra is done correctly it is safe
8239879 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8239880 its not an accident that ahpa members performed better weve called our members attention to the presence of heavy metals in plant materials lead is ubiquitous its in the soil and in the plants i dont think you can get these levels to zero but it is the manufacturers responsibility to know the amount and to limit it
8239881 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated blood pressure although not representing a fully developed strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8239882 in contradiction to a 60 year assumption in archaeology weve managed to show that neanderthal stone tool technologies are no less efficient in a number of respects than homo sapiens stone tool technologies this suggests that neanderthals did not go extinct because of inferior intellect or technology
8239883 i think this study is very important in that it is helping move neanderthals out of that dark box that they have traditionally been confined to
8239884 they are not just dumb limited versions of ourselves but highly advanced very intelligent cousins different does not mean inferior
8239885 theres been a longstanding historical bias against the neanderthals in any number of categories technological prowess hunting prowess intelligence reproductive abilities and success
8239886 the roots of this go back to the nineteenth century and its taken us a long time to shake this bias
8239887 have put a whole bunch of nails in the coffin of this idea
8239888 flint knapping is essentially chipping or flaking certain types of stone flint chert obsidian that have predictable fracture patterns
8239889 this assumption was published in all the textbooks but has never been tested thoroughly
8239890 in fact i just started excavating a site in armenia this summer that has blades from 200 000 400 000 years ago
8239891 it is also hypothesized sometimes that the reproduction levels of homo sapiens were much higher than that of neanderthals
8239892 this might have resulted in homo sapiens simply outpopulating the neanderthals out of existence
8239893 previous studies have shown that it does reduce infections there is some evidence that it may reduce medication errors the physician can talk to the patient in private and the family can be there
8239894 most of the cases of the sars outbreak in toronto came out of a hospital which could have been avoided if they didnt have multiple patients in a room
8239895 many people consider an expensive hotel room to be 300 to 500 per night whereas the average cost per night in a hospital is 400 to 2 000
8239896 about 40 000 in overall construction costs could be recouped and its not that much considering the cost of equipment
8239897 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
8239898 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
8239899 we found contrary to current recommendations that actually consumption of these foods did not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and didnt appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or its complications
8239900 there are probably going to be a subset of people where perhaps a more restrictive diet does benefit them
8239901 if you are a patient with known diverticular disease and you have had the experience of eating seeds nuts and popcorn and developed diverticular pain as assessed by your doctor you should probably not have those foods
8239902 given the overall findings of this meta analysis it seems appropriate that the guidelines recommending tight glucose control in all critically ill patients should be re evaluated until the results of larger more definitive clinical trials are available
8239903 possible explanations for the discordant results of the study by van den berghe et al and the meta analysis by wiener et al are that the meta analysis is flawed the studies that form the basis of the meta analysis are flawed or inherently different or the findings of the study by van den berghe et al occurred due to random chance or as a result of another unique factor interacting with tight glycemic control
8239904 those investigating tight glycemic control should take a step back and address the fundamental questions of defining quality standards for tight glycemic control finding affordable methods of frequent and highly accurate measurement of blood glucose in the icu and conduct multicenter efficacy studies to determine if tighter glycemic control can reduce mortality under optimal conditions if tighter glycemic control can be proven effective in optimal conditions determining how to make that benefit available to millions of critically ill patients in both developed and resource poor countries around the world would be a truly worthwhile challenge there is no simple or clear answer to the complex problem of glycemic control in critically ill adults at present targeting tight glycemic control cannot be said to be either right or wrong
8239905 there are patients who can fluently say something that sounds like a sentence but its just garbage
8239906 its one of the least understood disabilities in the world because these people cannot communicate for themselves
8239907 what makes the science very difficult in this field is that no two brain injuries are identical and therefore no two aphasias are identical
8239908 you know that smoodle pinkered and that i want to get him round and take care of him like you want before
8239909 the dog needs to go out so i will take him for a walk
8239910 its what youd do in italy youd use gestures to communicate things such as you need something to drink if someone gave you hell on the highway you wouldnt know what they were saying but you would know to back off
8239911 if its not the nodding up and down its the thumbs up or thumbs down
8239912 i start that right off the bat for folks with severe aphasia
8239913 to change the brain and then have the speech pathologist help change the brain in the right way
8239914 people who have aphasia need to be included in life
8239915 you need to have patience speaking with them but if you have patience they have a lot to say
8239916 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8239917 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8239918 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway

8239923 rampage feels awful about the womans baby but he had nothing to do with it and the traffic incident occurred because he was very ill and not with him in control of his faculties

8239987 viewers build up strong relationships with their favourite television shows and when theyve built up a rapport with these characters there is often a strong demand to see more of them on the big screen as evidenced by this years outings in the cinema for the x files and the phenomenal success of sex and the city even four years after the series finished on tv dr who and his latest incarnation david tennant has such a huge cult following that you can see why it has won this poll
