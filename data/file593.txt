5930000 theres a lot of interest and right now our game needs the boomers to gain respect
5930001 i amp squo ve been thinking about it and i don amp squo t think it will help the nbl that much
5930002 i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball but defensively we gave some chances away we have to improve in that area but that is what these games are for
5930003 overall im very pleased with the performance they looked fresh sharp
5930004 its always a good feeling to put one in the back of the net especially for australia
5930005 i thought we played well in the first half in the second half we made a few subs and didnt play as well as we could have but overall it was a good result
5930006 i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball but defensively we gave some chances away we have to improve in that area but that is what these games are for
5930007 just wanted to let you know that kathi russ and i loved the wizards they worked out perfectly im sure well be using you again
5930008 ive been thinking about it and i dont think it will help the nbl that much
5930009 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5930010 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5930011 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level
5930012 i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competition is there
5930013 but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order
5930014 its a very important time for our game in our country its taken some shots and a win wakes the whole country up
5930015 its like the socceroos in the world cup or the when wallabies play the all blacks
5930016 theres a lot of interest and right now our game needs the boomers to gain respect
5930017 i amp squo ve been thinking about it and i don amp squo t think it will help the nbl that much
5930018 that was the hardest thing ive ever done but i was the one who wanted the change from houston
5930019 were trying to find a fit for the young man
5930020 hes got a really good motor hes a good smart player usually when a guy really has a motor and pretty good speed and pass rush technique you try to find a place for him
5930021 this season is big because i finally get a chance to say look i can play defensive end
5930022 thats what im trying to say to myself to my family my friends the nfl i can play this position thats important to me
5930023 i just have to keep practicing hard and playing hard
5930024 the biggest thing for me since im the lightest defensive end is they want to be darn sure i can play the run
5930025 i think they have a good idea of my pass rushing they just want to see consistency in that
5930026 its been a long journey getting back to doing what i love to do at defensive end but i think were getting closer
5930027 we run hunts on it sell exotic animals breed whitetail deer scientifically with artificial insemination
5930028 we have a whole program of things its not a fortune 500 company but were doing all right
5930029 i got a good taste of how life could be
5930030 i used to wake him up at 5 a m and hed run sprints while id load trailers i taught him the same way i was raised but its something thats got to be in you mentally hes very strong hes always been able to train himself
5930031 penny is going really well were quite happy with her shes got a lot of swelling at the moment but were working on that and shes weight baring on it so well keep assessing things
5930032 i cant give a percentage about that whether she will play for the game tomorrow night shes certainly a chance and were giving her every opportunity
5930033 i definitely think she will be playing if we get past this next game and were hopeful that she could play tomorrow night
5930034 i cant see a reason why we cant get her on the court in the final
5930035 lauren has had some problems with the front of her ankle in the last couple of months
5930036 weve had to inject her on several occasions to get her to these olympics shes playing with a lot of pain at the moment and were looking towards an arthroscope operation in sydney next week
5930037 i feel okay im just focused on the semi final tomorrow and the gold medal game
5930038 its just one of those things where its been a long term injury that has basically been getting worse and worse this is just one of those things thats been building up but i cant wait to play against china tomorrow night
5930039 i feel like im getting better every game and its not stopping me from playing and nothing really to worry about
5930040 i dont mean to sound bitter cold or cruel but i am so thats how it comes out
5930041 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed
5930042 its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
5930043 its happened to me twice in my career believe me its disappointing
5930044 wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reasons to come back wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back for what happened this off season the only reason i came back is i wanted to play simple as that
5930045 once again in the two minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try weve put in during the weeks and really just talked about them
5930046 we never really came out and executed them and we kind of turned it loose today
5930047 we did good on a couple we didnt do quite as well on other ones the good thing is it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections i dont think were even close yet
5930048 he was pretty straightforward he would have wanted me to play all along im sure it would have been in green bay but hed probably be out here at practice every day raising hell with me what i could be doing better
5930049 he wouldve wanted me to play until my legs fell off that was just the way he was
5930050 i said theres no substitute for game like situations two minute drills red zone situations and third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5930051 with every preseason game ive played in id love to play the whole game
5930052 if im going to come out here and practice id love to play in the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it
5930053 if we can get that chemistry and play well together this team has a good chance our receiver talent here is a lot like what i played with in green bay young quick guys
5930054 each one of them offers something different than the next but we have four or five guys who can easily make big plays at any time i like it
5930055 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs
5930056 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5930057 we are worried the fcc will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services
5930058 the radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use
5930059 in that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do
5930060 everybody is not only angry and upset they are very very worried
5930061 from the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the fcc signs off on it
5930062 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get
5930063 lets just get back at it and get the field goal

5930079 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5930080 ive put too much work into this to lose because ive got long hair ive got to get the gold
5930081 if i had quit or stopped working i wouldnt be in this position
5930082 we made ben give up a lot of the opportunities of funking and go back to the basics of defending his legs and not giving up opportunities for position
5930083 in the olympics you cant give up that kind of position against the best guys in the world or they will take you down
5930084 thats the difference between ben in 2007 and ben in 2008
5930085 at first i didnt want to speak because i dont really like talking about myself in front of a bunch of kids
5930086 then i started to think wait this is a lifelong dream im an olympian it just hit me and i started bawling in my car
5930087 i have no fear its a wrestling match there are no weapons
5930088 the worst thing that could happen is i could be thrown over his head and thats a big maybe the only thing fear is going to do is make me perform poorly
5930089 mental toughness is one of those things that sets me apart along with my confidence
5930090 hed be making people scared during weigh ins if they had to wrestle him
5930091 however that removal provision now sits alongside a set of clauses that propose the dissolution of the entire board and the installation of a small hand picked interim board without any transparent process
5930092 that is offensive intimidatory and destructive of the security of tenure without which this body cannot protect section 16 editorial independence and the right of the public to be informed
5930093 it also puts on public display the intentions of the ruling portion of the ruling party
5930094 obviously the thinking is that the polokwane faction in parliament will decide and the new chairperson of that party will force the president to execute that decision
5930095 but that is the most primitive form of power politics it cannot be the law because it is unconstitutional
5930096 the proposition that an entire board of the sabc can be removed not by due enquiry but merely after a finding of a committee of the national assembly is quite simply outrageous
5930097 it is a patently obvious intra party political manoeuvre and in so doing this honourable house is being used as a tool for the political machinations of the new post polokwane ruling clique of the anc
5930098 we cannot and will not support bad law this bill is bad law

5930107 it is very good to be a vegetarian and particularly a vegan it is very healthy with low cholesterol or none if you are a vegan and good morally because of the bad treatment of animals at farms
5930108 if you like to have good vegan food talk to like minded people and just have fun then this is a good place to join
5930109 meet ups like this are not only great opportunities to meet the other vegans vegetarians in the area theyre also great places to stay informed about new products events networking whoo
5930110 you mean youre giving people discounts on health services they need and giving away free gas
5930111 ive got 18 year olds telling me theyre ready to turn pro now instead of staying in the program
5930112 theres no reason to for every olympian doing well in the pro game theres 10 guys doing better who werent
5930113 none of them are happy about leaving their coaches or being away from home
5930114 the team is very talented we should have all been doing real good
5930115 but everything we went through just with the residency program itself they should put that off it almost seems like they were going against you
5930116 it would have been better off if we were with our coaches where they know us weve been with them for years i was away from my family i wasnt doing good in school i wasnt training how i wanted to train so i was real stressed out
5930117 whatever decisions have been made i just go with it without complaining
5930118 im not a guy that complains the program has been pretty good on my behalf
5930119 an impeccably mounted survey of voices from across the spectrum of african american accomplishment a rich and revealing work of portraiture
5930120 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5930121 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5930122 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5930123 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5930124 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5930125 its something you can note and say we had a good draw
5930126 theres an element of luck but you ask anyone in the tournament and theyll say id rather have their draw than someone elses
5930127 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5930128 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5930129 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5930130 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
5930131 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5930132 when my grandmother got arthritis she couldnt bend over and paint her toenails anymore so my grandfather does it for her all the time even when his hands got arthritis too thats love
5930133 when someone loves you the way they say your name is different you just know that your name is safe in their mouth
5930134 love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other
5930135 love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your french fries without making them give you any of theirs
5930136 love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him to make sure the taste is ok
5930137 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss
5930138 love is whats in the room with you at christmas if you stop opening presents and listen
5930139 if you want to learn to love better you should start with a friend who you hate
5930140 love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt then he wears it everyday
5930141 love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well
5930142 during my piano recital i was on a stage and i was scared i looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling he was the only one doing that i wasnt scared anymore
5930143 my mommy loves me more than anybody you dont see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night
5930144 love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken
5930145 love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than brad pitt
5930146 love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day
5930147 i know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones
5930148 when you love somebody your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you
5930149 you really shouldnt say i love you unless you mean it but if you mean it you should say it a lot people forget
5930150 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5930151 even if the ministry needs to investigate the case further the teacher should be suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry
5930152 we commend the health ministry for acting decisively the same cannot be said about the education ministry which seems to be dragging its feet
5930153 the way theyve been pitching me i just looked for something out over the plate
5930154 how great you are o sovereign lord there is no one like you and there is no god but you
5930155 the scots invented hypnosis chloroform and the hypodermic syringe wouldnt it just be easier to talk to a woman
5930156 im glad they invented emoticons otherwise i wouldnt know what my dad was thinking
5930157 my uncle cleetus is illiterate and ambidextrous which is a double tragedy he is unable to write with both hands
5930158 listen i heard latrece was in the hospital have you heard from her today
5930159 no and thats odd too i normally would have an email from her by now after making a couple phone calls it was confirmed that she was in the hospital suffering from a blood clot in her brain

5930161 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
5930162 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
5930163 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
5930164 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
5930165 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
5930166 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
5930167 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
5930168 like you we also want to improve to make a change
5930169 there are two things stopping the chinese soccer team from going outside asia to take part in international games their left feet and their right feet
5930170 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5930171 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5930172 the man the legend the owner and primary alcoholic at buckman motors and lube
5930173 whoa self remember your promise chill out the debt exists separate from the worry they are two different things
5930174 what is really going on what is really on my mind
5930175 i dont we now get to the third problem which is fairly simple the and lil wayne chris cornell onerepublic pussycat dolls solange knowles and timbaland and lynyrd skynyrd to name but a few it is the fifth annual concert but the first time with all the hoopla of three network news anchors formally announcing plans for it back in july now t that has loads of pictures and information should that pique your interest the princess merely thought a website for a fundraiser of this magnitude would be a bit more well active or something wouldnt it if you would like your social secretary to pencil this in the concert is on stand up to cancer now that tp has that little tirade episode behind her lets talk fashion magazines shall we all is not hunky dory for at least for more than a few of them when it comes to the all important september fashion issues for openers vogues september issue with keira knightley on its cover is down by about 50 advertising pages from last year a rather stunning development cosmopolitan and w are among those magazines losing traction on the advertising side of the business on the other hand it turns out that actually boosted its advertising by a good percentage it features jessica simpson on the cover whats elle doing the others arent tp thinks it may have something to do with the cover girl selections last months cover showcased mariah carey before that mary kate olsen and the month prior to that it was singing star rihanna unless were misreading things they seem to be trending toward a much younger demo vanity fair and their slight shrinkage well we dont know about everyone else but here at the prepatorium the increasingly strident attacks on so many different things and people have become tiresome perhaps were poor citizens but were just tired of all the yelling one way publishers try to goose sales a little can be with different covers like the two bazaar used for their september blowout both with tyra banks we received the blue issue in our mailbox some designers actually spent more on magazine advertising this year than they did last year one of those doing so is oscar de la renta one of tps favorites below we show two looks from his 2009 bridal line that provides the perfect opportunity to showcase what has to be one of the most scenic locales for a fundraiser tp has ever seen ever seen were talking about oscar de la rentas 8th annual benefit for the league to save lake tahoe one arrives by boat for the party in what appears to be a classic century regardless of make it is tdf totally tp was used to the family century but realizes the majority were chris craft is there a better locale for a fashion show that you have attended if so you simply must tell us about it so we can share that info with the rest of the class we leave with something from a line tp currently doesnt have in her walk in and it will probably stay that way but we definitely applaud any new designers willing to take on the fashionistas with something new so how about this for the ultimate in lighting things up
5930176 when not being worn the pieces double in function as lamps avoiding the fate of hanging neglected in a closet
5930177 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
5930178 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5930179 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5930180 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5930181 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5930182 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
5930183 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
5930184 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
5930185 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
5930186 of course christ is the truth and only he has words of eternal life
5930187 mary most holy is always situated in the mystery of christ and of the church
5930188 the one person who had the clearest look the best look at the perpetrator in this case when given the opportunity was unable to identify him
5930189 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5930190 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5930191 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5930192 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5930193 it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
5930194 at the same time there are still a couple preseason games left and time before the season opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
5930195 the surgery was a complete success and he is resting comfortably
5930196 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5930197 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5930198 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5930199 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5930200 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5930201 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5930202 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5930203 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5930204 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5930205 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5930206 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5930207 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5930208 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5930209 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5930210 while we continue to believe bobs stores has great potential and an excellent organization our decision to sell the business reflects our vision to grow tjx as a global off price company
5930211 we believe that focusing on the significant opportunities to expand the domestic and international presence of our core off price concepts is the right strategy for us at this time
5930212 we believe tjxs sale of bobs will help management maintain focus on its core off price business model as bobs was the only non off price division in tjxs portfolio of brands and was not a strategic fit in our view
5930213 you work hard you get ahead and you dont stop
5930214 there is a job to be done and it is a good job because it pays it doesnt really matter what my education was at home the opportunity is here and you take it and you do it and it will work out
5930215 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
5930216 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
5930217 no money for anything clothes for us for our baby nothing
5930218 i saw how my father lived it was hard there in el salvador i saw how he tried to make ends meet to support us
5930219 when i saw that how he lived and i see this the opportunities that i have we have i say theres nothing that i cant do if i just keep at it
5930220 what choice do i have this is what it will take

5930244 i have seen it where people are made responsible for the cost and that gets quite high when you have to pull in resources from the province
5930245 when you are burning and there is a ban on obviously you have to be held responsible for the damage it causes but there was nobody there last night to lay charges on because they were gone
5930246 most of the calls we get about open burning are nuisance as opposed to anybody in any immediate danger you are a nuisance to your immediate neighbours or whoever
5930247 i think that is a part of the reason why there is a burning ban and it has been on here for a long time long before i got here that and the fact that everything is drier in the summer time
5930248 the worlds poorest nations are making halting progress in water but little or no tangible improvement in sanitation two of the basic necessities of life
5930249 the design of murals would be required to be reviewed to ensure they are in good taste and reflect local and provincial history in addition the location of the mural and safety of the artists would have to be addressed
5930250 while there were no issues with that we wanted to make sure if people are doing this they check it out with the city first
5930251 we want to have some control over what somebodys going to put on the side of a building
5930252 we didnt go after that individual because there were no issues with his mural
5930253 it was fairly tasteful but at the same time you could see some controls have to be in place it was raised to us by the dba not that there were any issues with what that individual had done but we dodged a bullet here
5930254 all the murals that went up in the downtown were done by our association except a couple of new ones done recently on broadway

5930257 i can think of probably three or four accidents in the past year myself
5930258 the department of transportation has a program where it checks rutting each year
5930259 it the pasadena deer lake highway wasnt on the list this year but the rutting got worse
5930260 hopefully this work can be done soon in the interest of public safety
5930261 people should still be cautious there until the work is done

5930266 i spoke to a lady and told her i needed accessiblity
5930267 if she told me there was no wheelchair washroom on that floor i would have paid the extra and booked a cabin to not tell you and you get there like an idiot its not good right
5930268 no power chair is going to get on that boat
5930269 you cant get on the elevator you cant do it unless youre able to pop a wheelie like me the boat is not accessible
5930270 you cant get on deck without somebody lifting you out there you cant go from one room to the other you cant go from the cafeteria to the bar power chairs dont do wheelies they dont its accessible where you park but the moment you leave your vehicle shes not accessible the terminal in port aux basques has one of the most accessible washrooms ive been in
5930271 shes actually going to try to contact this individual to see if she can get the information she needs to get and initiate an investigation into the complaint
5930272 this has been the most difficult and disappointing year since

5930292 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5930321 a number of former test players including majid imran khan wasim bari javed miandad and ejaz butt have been invited for a meeting at the sports ministry on wednesday in which the ad hoc committee will be given final shape
5930322 we dont know anything about the constitution being suspended by the sports ministry the board is working normally
5930323 they are still some other candidates in the run to be on the ad hoc committee among them dr zafar altaf a former bureaucrat and selector and dr mohammad ali shah president of the karachi city association kcca
5930324 some officials in the board asked ashraf that they wanted to resign with him but he told them not to do this and wait for the government to take its next decision
5930325 we are definitely going to appeal because the test results of the same samples are different
5930326 i am not disheartened the different results show something is wrong somewhere we will be filing an appeal with the drugs inquiry tribunal of the indian premier league and we will fight this case to the end

5930337 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego

5930355 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state

5930378 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5930379 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5930380 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
5930381 down the stretch run one season the cardinals get outfielder cesar cedeno whos near the end of his career and in the last year of his contract
5930382 and for a month hes the cardinals best player hes playing great center field hitting everything
5930383 i ask about his defense and whitey says hes playing like hes 24 again
5930384 i asked him if hed be in first place without cedeno and he said
5930385 so i finally asked him are you going to sign him to a contract extension and whitey says of course not i traded for him because he was in the final year of a contract and i knew hed play his behind off once he signs a deal this winter you wont be able to keep him on the field
5930386 clearly if youre working in the sixth or seventh inning youre not in to get the save so you cant get the save but you can blow the save
5930387 so at the end of the season ill probably have worked the ninth inning once and gotten the save but ill have six or seven blown saves i got a blown save in the sixth inning this year when we made an error and a run scored i dont get the rule

5930395 you can say the man was still in his senses despite his injuries he couldnt speak but he communicated with gestures police captain herman ruben gab told telam news agency after he responded to an emergency call by the mans nephew who heard the shots

5930405 we looked across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened that was one of the ways we delivered the budget surplus and we thought that was very important in fighting inflation

5930419 its going to be a little different set up for our fans so we felt the proper course of action was to temporarily suspend charging for admission to fetzer until we get a little cleaner access to the front entrance
5930420 a win win for all of us weve desired a night race for a number of years
5930421 we have to pinch ourselves to be sure this is really happening
5930422 we know how complicated the schedule change was to complete
5930423 this is an emerging market for nascar but also a very important one
5930424 also moving to the end of october separates our two events
5930425 we have a tremendous fan base with what we believe is enormous growth potential our iowa fans are crazy about racing since we have no professional baseball basketball or football teams in the state to compete with
5930426 we have a lot of great competition and were very proud of the progress weve played in trying to establish nascar motorsports and chicagoland speedway
5930427 a tangible example of our growth is our tv ratings for this year for the nascar sprint cup series up 26 percent compared to last year
5930428 the inaugural labor day event in california was the addition of a second race in california and the schedule throughout the 60 year history of nascar has been a work in progress to find the right place at the right time for the series
5930429 we certainly dont think were going to replace darlington but what weve done is given southeastern fans an opportunity to have an event back in the southeast at a longtime nascar speedway
5930430 well be celebrating our 50th year of racing next year and this event certainly is going to be the keystone of that celebration
5930431 we felt the opportunity to have a night event in a summertime setting on a holiday weekend overshadowed the opportunity to be in the chase
5930432 we have some unique marketing partnerships with the military and with our area sports franchises everything from the angels to college football
5930433 ive challenged our staff to throw the box away weve only been in existence two years officially next month this just raises the ante
5930434 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert he said

5930439 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
5930440 had the vegetation been adequately maintained the truck driver would have been able to clearly see the ghan stop and then proceed safely over the crossing when the train had passed
5930441 i cant comment on our internal investigation and im not privy to the facts in the sbis criminal investigation
5930442 based on the information we discovered the district attorneys office wanted an independent review
5930443 this doesnt mean the bad guys wont chop it up
5930444 the motivation behind the move was the need to scale our organization while taking into account employee preferences to be located together as much as possible spokeswoman malorie lucich said via e mail
5930445 the move is the best solution to limiting our continued fragmentation in palo alto
5930446 we have loved our time in downtown palo alto and consider it part of the dna here at facebook
5930447 many of our employees live in the area and will continue to be a part of the downtown community
5930448 positions us well to continue looking for a long term campus solution
5930449 im sorry to see them go but i understand that they have to
5930450 in college you need to have the welfare of the kids in mind
5930451 and im not sure the chance of getting guys injured in live contact against other schools would be the way to go there are positives but i think the injury factor outweighs the positives
5930452 i think every coachs nightmare is turning the ball over and crazy special teams play and thats what happens in the first game your first game is really your first live practice against another team so it makes sense if you could have controlled scrimmages from that standpoint
5930453 the nfl wants to put the best product possible out there on the field on opening day and thats one of the reasons they have four preseason games
5930454 but we dont have a bunch of free agents that were going to get rid of
5930455 you want to do whats best for them the product might not be as sharp in your first game as it would be if you had an exhibition or a scrimmage but thats just the way it is
5930456 fisher deberry used to talk all the time that at the end of the spring you have a game and the proceeds could go to the university for the athletic department or maybe support charities or whatever
5930457 and that talk is still out there it would give you an opportunity to play a real game in the springtime
5930458 but adding the 12th game has squelched some of that talk and i think when it all came down to it if coaches were asked to make a decision they would still vote against it you just dont want to risk injuries and you dont want to be doing that stuff when youre down to crunch time academically im not unhappy with the way we have it now
5930459 you work with drawings and plans and you think you have some idea of what its going to be and then you walk into it for the first time and i was shocked i was thrilled of course by just the magnitude of it all
5930460 we think its going to have a positive impact not only on the football program but the athletic department and the university and the community
5930461 we want this facility to be used by all of those organizations within the university but also to be used by the community
5930462 we want to let fans in for that game with baylor and its free of charge
5930463 we are looking at that possibility and the tower is available for a naming opportunity and weve talked with some individuals about that
5930464 nothing is on the immediate horizon but we are hopeful for the future
5930465 i love that when you go on the photo deck on the seventh floor on the south side there is a phenomenal view of the skyline of winston salem
5930466 we hope to get the tv reporters who do their shots from the stadium that they will use that as part of the back drop
5930467 everyone has had exactly the same response i cant believe its this good
5930468 skeeter was an icon and not only at wake forest but for the acc in fact we have an award named for him in the acc
5930469 we have a lot of details to work out but we are really in the first hour of this
5930470 i learned that you really have to be conscious of your activity and your decision making
5930471 as a leader of the team im held to a higher standard i definitely have to be smarter
5930472 it was fine it was a good move by coach
5930473 it was good for me personally so i could get mentally focused on what was going on with the season
5930474 coming back and being able to speak and represent the team in a better light is definitely a positive for me now
5930475 i learned so much from it i definitely plan on not making that mistake again
5930476 coach said were not having that at all he said he wanted linebackers that can run
5930477 this past summer i made so many changes in my body
5930478 i feel great ive been running sprints with the defensive backs and receivers it was something i couldnt do last summer
5930479 im a big believer that everything happens for a reason
5930480 the new staff came in for my last season i have the opportunity as a leader and as a senior leader to leave a mark here before i leave
5930481 thats all ive been thinking about all summer every time im in the weight room every time i come in early every time i run im thinking about setting myself up and this team to shock a lot of people
5930482 no matter how big you can ever be for whatever fee or publicity never loose your integrity for years theres been some prize horses in this stable
5930483 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
5930484 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5930485 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5930486 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5930487 im going to out there to run my heart out
5930488 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5930489 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5930490 he had a tight hamstring last night so we didnt put him out there
5930491 he actually tweaked it in the weight room thats the first quarterback to ever tweak a hamstring in the weight room
5930492 but we didnt want to take any chances on having him pull it
5930493 ive got to tell you im really impressed with brett hodges
5930494 to be behind riley and to not complain and to come out every day and practice the way he has
5930495 if you watch us practice you would never know that brett hodges is not the starting quarterback by the way he performs on a daily basis he has gone out all spring and all summer with the second team offense and never complained one bit and tonight to watch him perform was fun
5930496 it just got tight on me the last two days and it was just kind of precautionary coach grobe felt its not worth the risk to do something running around and pull it when its not 100 percent and be out four or five weeks
5930497 its a little bit like defensive end matt robinson and tackle jeff griffin guys who have been starters for us and know what to do that are proven guys
5930498 we dont need to find out how tough they are we just need to make sure before we put them back out there that theyre healthy
5930499 he could have gone last night don gave him the green light to go tonight and i just felt like it didnt do us any good to have him going if his leg is sore
5930500 leroi moore saxophone player for the dave matthews band died tuesday of injuries suffered in an accident on an all terrain vehicle in june he was 46
5930501 not knowing who done it or why they done it because we heard were not the only ones this has happened to
5930502 weve got to fight to make sure america gets back on track
5930503 are we going to do the same old things or are we going to change how government works
5930504 what we have inside the spirit of freedom is a museum and exhibit about the berlin airlift
5930505 and we fly around the country educating people about what happened right after world war two
5930506 i didnt realize at the time what a tremendous mission this was
5930507 it not only saved west berlin it saved all of europe
5930508 was over there at the invitation of the german government
5930509 they remember i didnt realize at the time how significant it was but that part of europe is free and the berlin airlift is the catalyst that kept it free
5930510 its nice to remember something where you have saved a city without firing a shot
5930511 and kept the western sectors of berlin free cause freedom you cant buy it you gotta earn it im very proud very very proud get a little choked up at times too
5930512 we still have the ability to issue citations and confiscate placards for abuses
5930513 doing a green building from scratch turned out to cost a lot more than we anticipated
5930514 you name a big democratic fundraiser who has given to democratic politics in the last four years and they were there
5930515 it makes sense why they would want to be called it it makes no sense why we would want to call them that
5930516 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not
5930517 they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence
5930518 the fact is the muslim world isnt waiting around holding its breath to hear the u s government an infidel entity define islamic terms for them
5930519 this seems to me unprecedented when we fought the japanese and we fought the nazis we called them what they called themselves
5930520 if osama bin laden calls himself a mujahid we should understand what a mujahid is and we should understand that that is in english a holy warrior whos fighting on behalf of islam
5930521 you want to know your enemy how they think what they call themselves what those terms mean
5930522 according to islamic law offensive jihad offensive not just to defend yourself but offensive to go out and invade is as codified and is obilgatory
5930523 you trace it to islamic doctrine and law jihad is simply warfare to subjugate the infidel world to islamic rule
5930524 having said that if there is some sort of discrimination that comes out in the reporting that is arguably contrary to the code then i would also feel that it would be open to a complainant to challenge the reporting as being discriminatory on the grounds of race
5930525 im of the opinion that even if i dont like what you have to say i have to accept it theres lots of times i dont like what i read but im not the judge of that
5930526 im having a real philosophical problem with barbara hall recognizing freedom of expression and at the same time telling the media what their responsibility is
5930527 i wanted to call every single one of the nominees in because if were going to have a human rights system in ontario i think we deserve as ontarians to know what the individual philosophies are of these tribunal members
5930528 for a province as large and as diverse as ontario to have 2 500 formal complaints a year that thats a very low level
5930529 because it means that as a society we are treating people fairly and equally and that members of society dont feel the need to complain about their treatment
5930530 it is relatively clear that the foreigners are not seeking asylum to stay in sweden but to receive financial support
5930531 a lot of people have discovered gaps in the swedish market which has led them to introduce products or services they have experience of from their home countries
5930532 theres a lot of interest but at the same time its danish there are the cartoons
5930533 its not about being blasphemous though its about things that make both sides have a laugh thats more difficult than being provocative
5930534 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5930535 malaysia is shocked and expresses its disappointment over the intention by the pro koln group to host an anti islamization congress in cologne germany proposed to be held on sept 19 and 20 2008
5930536 malaysia wishes to emphasize the importance that all efforts are necessary to be taken by governments and responsible organizations to build and promote interfaith relations dialogue and understanding between different religions and cultures
5930537 this way zukorlic has imposed himself as the only protector of islam and causing this much stir over the book will only result in a bigger demand for the novel
5930538 i doubt that the mufti has read the book and it seems he is acquainted only with the parts which directly refer to scenes from the koran the muslim holy book
5930539 i expect that no one will ever again with any publication insult muslim sanctity the jewel of medina will not have its second edition
5930540 if someone regards the prophet mohammed as a saint one cannot force others to have the same symbol of faith
5930541 225 000 ethnic albanian men aged between 14 and 59
5930542 unlike synagogues mosques rarely require armed guards much of the violence directed against jews actually emanates from muslims muslim extremists
5930543 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5930544 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5930545 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5930546 it is 99 likely that the film will be banned in all arab countries
5930547 we are also passing through a very hard time in the rest of the middle east
5930548 some of the arrested suspects were planning to stage terrorist attacks on oil fields and installations
5930549 i am announcing now that iran is ready to launch satellites of friendly islamic countries into space
5930550 every year a large number of poor people caste hindus buddhist muslims and tribal people convert to christianity through financial support
5930551 poverty and economic problems are the main causes of conversion to christianity
5930552 christian missionaries and ngos are working to convert people in the name of social service and development works
5930553 i have no information about increasing christian population in bangladesh
5930554 because there is no department in the ministry of religious affairs to look into how many people convert into christian
5930555 musharraf has proven himself to be one of the biggest enemies of islam if not the biggest
5930556 all support to topple the muslim emirate in afghanistan it is evident that during the past years the pakistan armys primary duty has been to take part in the killing of muslims from kabul to islamabad
5930557 the evaluation will determine whether or not the followers have truly adhered to the items in the decree we are considering whether to return them to their home villages but it all depends on the community there
5930558 the government cannot work alone to resolve the issue the initiative must also come from the ahmadiyah followers they must be able to assimilate into society before we can return them to their homes
5930559 lamb the gospel according to biff christs childhood friend which both jess and bridge will tell you is hilarious it was one of the funniest things ive ever read
5930560 consumers have embraced the dvd format like no other technology and invested in large libraries of their favourite movies

5930562 you cant be here this is my house i dont wanna see it burnin down on the damn tee vee
5930563 we give that evidence to support the little shoulders on which this case lies
5930564 after reviewing a report of the sbi investigation it is my opinion that the officer acted at all times in a legal and appropriate manner
5930565 it is always a tragedy when someone dies under these circumstances
5930566 it is also a tragedy that the officer no matter how justified in his actions will live the rest of his life with the memory of these events
5930567 what hes doing at the university has not been worked out yet
5930568 weve done a lot of work over the past 18 months
5930569 clearly customers have embraced this agreement and given us strong feedback and completely support the approach weve taken
5930570 they just wanted microsoft and novell to provide what we call a covenant not to sue
5930571 this is definitely a year for our leaders to emerge in each class
5930572 leadership is really going to be a key for this team in order for us to have the type of year weve been working for and talking about all off season
5930573 the seniors are an important aspect of our success this year
5930574 we are counting on them to fulfill their leadership roles with their actions on and off the field
5930575 the junior class is a talent group of individuals that can really help take our program to the level of play we want
5930576 with an additional year of experience they should be ready to make the transition into established veteran leaders
5930577 everyone in the sophomore class should be at 100 when we start practice in the fall
5930578 now that the first year learning curve is over the time is now for this group to step into new roles and produce on both ends of the field
5930579 this is a tough athletic group that should compete for a position right from the start
5930580 we have a lot of challenging non league road games at the beginning of the year that will help prepare for conference play at the end of september
5930581 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
5930582 this ordinance is a bald faced mean spirited political attack on me
5930583 if you share hope and faith for what we aim to accomplish you will help me oppose this vicious political attack
5930584 we are trying to make sure there is a quality volunteer experience and the city and the volunteer are both protected
5930585 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5930586 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5930587 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5930588 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5930589 i think a lot of americans are starting to rethink the whole energy and transportation question in this country
5930590 so critical to the survival of the businesses out here
5930591 he brought a gun to a fistfight and used it
5930592 the star s feature sections routinely eschew the routine in favor of imaginative design lively writing and relevant content
5930593 from fyi to a amp e to food readers find interesting stories and eye catching presentation when a special occasion arises such as the opening of the redesigned nelson atkins art gallery the star rises to that occasion with a special section that captures both style and substance when most newspapers are cutting back and trimming down the judges were impressed with the star s continuing commitment to kansas citys life beyond the headlines
5930594 insurance touches everybody those who are covered those who are not covered
5930595 nobody likes to buy it that gives rise to the adage that insurance is always sold never bought but once insurance companies and their agents close the sale do they provide the expected service often the answer is no this series explores why problems so often arise then explains what consumers can do to alleviate the damage
5930596 to be able to open today tuesday is very rewarding
5930597 our 10 year long range plans were condensed into one summer
5930598 while it the tornado was devastating it became an opportunity to be better than we were before
5930599 they school officials have taken a tragedy and turned it into an opportunity
5930600 in the back of my mind i had a plan b but i never shared it
5930601 what at this point in my life is my understanding of my jewish identity
5930602 how and why and to what extent is that significant to me
5930603 i experienced a validation of raising our children within the traditions and community of the workmens circle in the eyes of my more conservative aunts and uncles after the event i felt that our daughter had undergone a certain rite of passage
5930604 i found myself needing kleenex for quite a bit of the ceremony the kids were so composed and it did feel like a true rite of passage im very glad we did it
5930605 im happy to share in all the rituals and learn alongside our kids
5930606 i thought it was a lovely event and interesting that most kids spoke about being a secular jew
5930607 it seems to me that the wc crowd is secure enough in its own jewishness not to feel the need to defend against non jewish people and ideas and to truly welcome all thats the kind of non defensive at ease big hearted jewish identity id like to see take root in my children
5930608 since in america today being jewish is really a choice why should you choose to be jewish
5930609 so be jewish as part of our community because its good for you
5930610 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
5930611 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
5930612 this part of the road is a blind corner going downhill and its a sharp corner
5930613 the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour but the car was going to fast to take the curve
5930614 he went airborne once he hit the end of that yard and he went straight through the garage and out the other side
5930615 we find ourselves in a situation where if we want to be able to enforce our speed limit on massachusetts we need to raise the speed limits
5930616 unopened product lasts 2 years and opened product lasts 18 months remember traditional makeup supports the growth of bacteria and must be discarded after 6 months
5930617 if it has a higher percentage of pigment such as mineral makeup then you have about a year
5930618 though many promising policies have emerged to promote physical activity and good nutrition in communities
5930619 they are not being adopted or implemented at levels needed to turn around this health crisis
5930620 i asked him what was up he said he was taking them and selling them
5930621 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5930622 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry i think its all part of healing
5930623 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemo and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be ok no matter what
5930624 i am not dating michael phelps i have never ever in my life hooked up with michael phelps
5930625 to tell you the truth we dont even talk to each other
5930626 i have to keep something private you guys know everything else
5930627 stop dating the church and start falling in love with the family of god
5930628 it gives you a better look at what the skills of that individual are so if you can have that information its better to know
5930629 they have a good understanding of what they do and the biggest thing i think they do well is they adjust well to you when you move theyre prepared for the next move
5930630 you have to be strategic and able to execute the physical side of it also
5930631 it does you no good to be standing in the right place if you cant make the tackle
5930632 thats one of those things most teams dont like to do when you start chop blocking theres a chance you lose someone so you have to do it in a controlled manner
5930633 i think we have done that and exposed our guys to it but at the same time not put them at risk
5930634 they want me to do everything im doing to be pain free and that was the case monday
5930635 im not really allowed to open up and really sprint yet well see kind of day by day when im able to do that but besides that i feel really good
5930636 i feel like i could but its not necessary at this point
5930637 check out their whole podcasting section theres some really good stuff there
5930638 greylodge regularly posts links to cool arty stuff on youtube and elsewhere wow subscribe to their video linkdump rss feed
5930639 take time and look two or three times before pulling into the intersection
5930640 theres so many talents out there and the community needs to know that
5930641 i feel as though everybody should be given a second chance these guys know they screwed up and want to give back
5930642 wouldnt it be great if we could have some paint
5930643 i didnt expect to get 52 gallons of brand new paint
5930644 its allowed us to really spruce things up for the kids and do some projects we couldnt have done with two people
5930645 i feel ive taken the taxpayers money so i feel privileged to give something back
5930646 its good to provide something you know and learn something in return
5930647 i feel like im going out on a good note
5930648 i think both of us feel we made a difference in their lives
5930649 in my experience those that are skilled tradesmen like to see the results of their work
5930650 then again we see guys who like to work in the humane society we try to fit a square peg in a square hole
5930651 they do seem to get a lot of satisfaction from helping others
5930652 i think they really do get some idea of what it means to do something for someone else
5930653 i feel like the clients and the community benefit in a way that would never be realized if they were confined to a county jail or state institution
5930654 theyve been very respectful theyve been hardworking they seem to take an interest in the school
5930655 theyve done a lot of work that we wouldnt have been able to do
5930656 we dont guarantee anyones behavior and it is extremely unfortunate for the decisions he made but what i would regret is if his decisions reflected poorly on the program itself or all of the hundreds of other people who made good decisions
5930657 its such a rare event it would be a shame to have all of our clients get painted with the same brush
5930658 were going to provide a client to come down here and assist jack
5930659 its the first step in being a productive member of society
5930660 that kind of summarizes what we hope to do here
5930661 it is a place for students and teachers to experience activities beyond the scope of the regular classroom curriculum
5930662 last year when the schools came together jane and i were talking and we wanted to do a gifted program
5930663 he had this expertise and enthusiasm to get the program going
5930664 it forced us to come up with something completely unique
5930665 what we notice is that students are gifted in many areas and may not be academically qualified
5930666 we realized we wanted something that could touch the whole school and help kids on both ends of the spectrum
5930667 if we can alleviate some of the leg work and organize some of those things for the teachers thats what were here to do
5930668 are they going to get what they need for testing purposes and to meet state standards absolutely because theyre going beyond
5930669 its almost like taking a field trip in the building
5930670 i think its just a start of something that everyone in the community is going to share
5930671 i believe in catholic education and i believe were got a lot to offer
5930672 teachers and administration have a responsibility to give the best education with the best up to date tools
5930673 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5930674 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
5930675 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5930676 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5930677 even the miniscule erratic wireless signal at the window seems to have been extinguished so heaven only knows when i will be able to post this
5930678 thalia asked why they arent giving me anything for contractions and the answer is that contractions are often a sign of infection which could be dangerous to simone and they dont want to mask them as soon as my water broke i was started on antibiotics which were discontinued a few days ago so they are certainly trying to prevent infection just not contractions
5930679 this is great getting a regular cable show is something ive wanted
5930680 everybody likes to work the refs to make their own kind of political hay
5930681 this moral police must not be allowed to control our agitations and determine our morality
5930682 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5930683 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5930684 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5930685 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5930686 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5930687 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5930688 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5930689 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5930690 the incident was not worthy of the time spent to adjudicate it
5930691 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been brought
5930692 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
5930693 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
5930694 this honor reflects mattels strong commitment to providing a great work environment for its employees because it is their creativity and talent that enables mattel to design develop and market fun and innovative toys

5930698 isnt it hard to only have three minutes to argue against the death penalty
5930699 you have to learn to survive and prosper in a hostile environment
5930700 its kind of a talent that gay people bring to everything we do

5930716 my mother was not only a good worker who never let any adversity get her down but she was also a happy and fun loving woman who people liked
5930717 she was always on the go and thats why she loved living in mckeesport with its mills churches and busy shopping areas
5930718 mom fit in wherever she went whether it was at the restaurant her church or at a bingo game
5930719 it was a fairly big restaurant that not only catered to the men and women who worked at u s steels national tube but the various businesses
5930720 and on busy days mom would also go out on the floor and wait on customers
5930721 my mother would take them for long bus rides and on picnics she even took my children to disney world in florida
5930722 she was known for her easter pascha her ice box cookies and her chicken noodle soup my mother also enjoyed crocheting and creating numerous crafts that she sold
5930723 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5930724 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5930725 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5930726 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5930727 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5930728 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5930729 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5930730 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5930731 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5930732 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5930733 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5930734 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5930735 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5930736 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5930737 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5930738 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5930739 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
5930740 i will be by the entrance until opening time and then proceed inside
5930741 we have no plans to sow terror in mindanao it is the government of the philippines that is creating trouble in mindanao
5930742 there are three things a government must handle for no one else can external defense internal order and maintaining an honest currency
5930743 of course a government can and occasionally ought to do all kinds of things but the more additional things it takes on the more likely it is that it will neglect the three musts and the one most likely to be neglected is the currency do everything governments nearly always allow inflation to gain a hold
5930744 liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate the farmers liquidate real estate and so purge the rottenness from the economy
5930745 im just focusing on staying on the field as long as im on the field and playing to my potential everything will fall into place
5930746 we have to get darren on the field as much as possible
5930747 hes having a good camp after that it becomes a competition between mcdougle and chris clemons for a roster spot
5930748 mcdougle has come a long way and hes performing well its tough for chris right now because hes not on the field until we get him back were not going to know if he is good enough to make the team
5930749 i learned a long time ago that the more things you can do to help the team the better off you are
5930750 moving from right to left is going to be an adjustment though it sounds like the same position but its really not its like asking a right handed batter in baseball to switch hit or for a right handed golfer to play left handed
5930751 the injuries have definitely set me back a little bit
5930752 when youre not able to get out there with the rest of the guys and mesh with them its tough to make progress
5930753 its frustrating but i know once i get on the field ill be ready to play
5930754 hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick
5930755 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5930756 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5930757 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5930758 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing

5930760 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5930761 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5930762 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5930763 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5930764 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
5930765 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
5930766 it was hour after hour not even letting up for a minute
5930767 ive been doing this for 10 15 years and the biggest rain was two point something inches that was a big deal
5930768 i said holy cow how much rain have we had we had 7 inches i emptied it it can only hold ten
5930769 the flow across the front and at the surface and aloft promoted training of thunderstorms
5930770 the cells were moving east southeast and they kept regenerating on the backside as one moved along the next one was coming up and continuing down the same path
5930771 i looked out the window and saw things ive never seen before
5930772 infrastructure damage that i didnt think i would ever see it will stick with me for a long time
5930773 such a large area and so many people were affected it dwarfs any other events ive seen
5930774 we lost 8 people total within 50 miles of la crosse from that event
5930775 i think you have to give tremendous credit to the folks who responded incredible response and they can be grateful for the work they did they saved many people
5930776 theres got to be the ability for people to get those necessities of life
5930777 they city residents pay twice the level of taxation because they pay city and county taxes but you get lower water rates that is sort of the agreement across most of the state
5930778 effectively put ashevilles noncity water consumers on equal footing with ashevilles city water consumers
5930779 its my hope that we can still reach some settlement with the city of asheville to put all these issues behind us and move forward
5930780 to allow our state representatives to successfully steal control of ashevilles water system without exhausting our legal recourse would be cowardly
5930781 it creates opportunities for us to see at this point how we can come together for the greater good of asheville and buncombe county
5930782 it was basically what we had expected to occur we just want to come up with a settlement thats fair to everybody
5930783 the city taxpayers are paying city attorneys fees county attorneys fees and state attorneys fees i think that everyone just wants to get some resolution and get on to other things
5930784 i think its the most fair thing that could happen and i am just thrilled
5930785 i think theyll be happy asheville cant force annexation on them and they cant raise water rates to take care of city service
5930786 my hope has been quite honestly for a long time that we could get an agreement worked out between the city and the county and maybe this will go toward helping it happen
5930787 we will continue business as usual the city of asheville has been operating the system under the current sullivan acts that are in place so it is seamless
5930788 there is an inequity in the situation that we as city residents have compared to other cities usually higher rates outside the city is the way that surrounding areas help shoulder the burden that other municipalities have
5930789 citizens of asheville are stuck with higher water bills as well as higher property taxes because of this unfair legislation it singles asheville out and treats us differently
5930790 i hope that the other parties would agree that for the sake of the community its in everybodys best interest to try to get back to the negotiating table
5930791 i would support appeal to the highest courts to allow our state representatives to successfully steal control of ashevilles water system without exhausting our legal recourse would be cowardly
5930792 this is the third time its been through the courts since 1933 and every time the sullivan acts have been upheld i just think its time for everybody to sit down at the table
5930793 dont you wish sometimes that north carolina had some interesting political characters who were just a little bit naughty
5930794 what do you think he eats he does not eat cabbage nor turnips nor ham and eggs nor fatback like you and i do my friends think of it senator morrison eats caviar
5930795 this here aint a jar of squirrel shot its fish eggs friends it pains me to tell you that cam morrison eats fish eggs and red russian fish eggs at that and they cost two dollars now let me ask you do you want a senator who aint too high and mighty to eat good ole north carolina hen eggs or dont you

5930798 eat your heart out melbourne nowhere to be found mr iemma said at the board game launch in sydney today
5930799 how pleasing it is that sydney scored the red squares right next to new york and london
5930800 statistics have revealed that more australians voted for melbourne than sydney but it was sydneys popularity around the world that secured its inclusion mr peattie said at the launch
5930801 language group on the board with london and new york also being english speaking cities
5930802 sex contributes to general good health any sexual intimacy that is enjoyable and pleasurable promotes well being by providing several physical and psychological benefits it is believed that sex boosts chemicals in the body that protects us against diseases research also suggests that sex and masturbation can help ease joint and muscle pain combat depression promote heart health and lengthen ones life span
5930803 the basic fact is that a good sex life also means in a larger picture a good relationship with ones partner and this makes the partner happier less stressed and by virtue of that physically healthier
5930804 a satisfying sexual relationship strengthens the bond between couples making them feel secure and loved the feeling of emotional connectedness adds to ones sense of belonging which in totality helps them achieve a positive physical psychological and spiritual state that is necessary for ones general health
5930805 sex is a way of bonding at the physical mental and emotional level and leads to health including psychological benefits if it is used as a mechanical process it may have limited benefits there are physiological benefits of positive changes in parameters like pulse heart rate reduction in blood pressure after an increase in b p specially if vigourous sex is tried dilation of blood vessels and capillaries of the skin leading to a glow burning of a few calories depending on the duration of the act and vigour exercising of some of the muscles thus improving lung capacity during heavy breathing
5930806 the extra edge of sex may be due to the feeling of being wanted an expression of emotions and certain hormonal and physiological changes that happen as an expression of love for another individual unfortunately the benefits of sexuality are usually quoted out of context and people may look at this as a panacea for everything but sexuality without emotions have limited value
5930807 this really is showing that we need to be starting these prevention efforts even earlier
5930808 whether were talking about sexual intercourse or substance use one thing is clear
5930809 the earlier youths engage in the behavior the better chance they have of experiencing long term negative impacts in their lives
5930810 it is definitely something that shapes our health curriculum over time
5930811 my mom is open to me coming and asking her anything
5930812 theres more pressure in middle school because you are young and more vulnerable

5930820 but i think mccain will be better for indian country
5930821 you know where his commitment lies and it will be strong thats an incredible opportunity in my opinion
5930822 that will only happen on the backs of indian people
5930823 john mccain at one time claimed that he was a friend of indians
5930824 he hasnt done anything substantial except hold an occasional hearing and talk like a friend
5930825 im telling everybody out there that hes not the guy hes not the man for indian country
5930826 the hell of it is neither is the other one

5930841 a few years ago i was practically the only woman on the beaches and in the outdoor restaurants wearing a vlh but ive now noticed that more and more women are covering their heads with them whether for protection or fashion i dont know but either way it works
5930842 this was the worst possible scenario naming it at 10 minutes to 5 on a friday afternoon
5930843 had they not done it then it wouldnt have gotten peoples attention until monday morning
5930844 nobody was doing the things they need to do to prepare
5930845 everything here is new 4 years old new poles new feeders new transformers

5930850 brazil renews its strongest repudiation of an unjustifiable act of violence against innocent people especially since it was directed against those working for peace and development
5930851 to second guess the mind set of a young man in the heat of battle four years later and to put the question in a civilian court system that cant even remotely comprehend the battlefield is shameful for this government
5930852 while not acknowledging that any part of the governments case is true the fact is the military sent these people out to do a job and kill everything that moved in a city where there were no good guys left
5930853 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5930854 the buck will stop with me because ill be the president
5930855 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of the government where he thinks hes above the law
5930856 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
5930857 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5930858 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5930859 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
5930860 we had a vigorous campaign senator clinton ran a historic campaign
5930861 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5930862 we know that there are people who have valuable information so we ask individuals to look deep into their hearts and help us bring the person responsible for this horrible and senseless act to justice
5930863 here is what you do friends forget country forget king forget wife and children and freedom forget every concept however noble that you imagine you fight for here today act for this alone for the man who stands at your shoulder he is everything and everything is contained within him
5930864 a king does not command his mens loyalty through fear nor purchase it with gold he earns their love by the sweat of his own back and the pains he endures for their sake that which comprises the harshest burden a king lifts first and sets down last a king does not require service of those he leads but provides it to them he serves them not they him
5930865 i said no no no we dont want any dogs in the house but its funny how a dog can win you over fast by her second night with us we all began to love her
5930866 because we saw her as the girl we never had
5930867 the moment i walked through the door there shed be tail wagging so happy to see me
5930868 whenever shannon would hear me shout shed run up the stairs and this was not a dog whod back down shed wait up there until i cooled down and came up too and then shed lie beside me licking my face as if to say hey its going to be ok and i still love you
5930869 this dog i did not want ended up being my shepherd
5930870 some nights after a confrontation i would take her with me for a ride just the two of us in the car this might sound corny but i would pat her and say youre right shannon everythings going to be ok
5930871 she was such a source of comfort to me in those terrible times it was if she understood me like no one else could she never let me down not even when we both knew i deserved it
5930872 these last few weeks she was hardly able to walk
5930873 and she had stopped eating i would carry her up the stairs and lay her at the foot of our bed we could see she was becoming feeble
5930874 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5930875 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5930876 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5930877 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5930878 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5930879 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5930880 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5930881 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5930882 i wish i had never had you and had stuck with dogs
5930883 im not going to pay you to be my mother
5930884 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
5930885 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
5930886 the government has been deceiving the milf for a long time
5930887 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5930888 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5930889 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
5930890 we want russia to be able to have the possibility if it so desires to inspect the future base
5930891 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
5930892 if youre telling me they want to work ill give them a go
5930893 why not ill employ anyone so long as they are willing to work
5930894 the kind of money which employers are putting up to bring them in and repatriate them would be much better invested in getting local aboriginal people a start in the local economy
5930895 the fact that weve got a substantial pool of unemployed people who are our immediate ongoing responsibility makes this an exercise in folly because obviously if any of these pacific islanders are working nearby high unemployment aboriginal towns the local people are going to feel cheated
5930896 my frustration in all this stuff is the inept failure of government to actually engage
5930897 to hear that the government are proposing to bring in more overseas workers when aboriginal people are disadvantaged in the workforce is shameful
5930898 i cant understand them importing people from other places when youve got really high unemployment in your town be it aboriginal white or what
5930899 every season we get aboriginal people here picking fruit for us
5930900 any person who comes in looking for work gets put on
5930901 in a place like robinvale thriving industry not enough workers they should be supplied from within australia
5930902 if weve got a work shortage in places like cape york and theyve got a worker shortage down here we should provide the workers
5930903 if youre going to fly people from the pacific islands whats wrong with flying people from cape york for instance or karratha or melbourne or sydney or brisbane or nhulunbuy
5930904 sick to death of watching their fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick
5930905 the requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first
5930906 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
5930907 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
5930908 i think there is a fair chance perth will be the 21st centurys first ghost metropolis
5930909 there has been a swirl of information based on being seen in a bodybuilding video that he is somehow concocting some fraud regarding his disability

5930914 you have to look the runner back you have young players they are going to do some things hopefully they learn from it that was a tough way for johnny to give up his only run
5930915 that runner on third base is far more important than that runner going down to first base
5930916 soto executed the play perfectly by going at the right time staying just behind encarnacion and out of his peripheral vision until he threw to first base
5930917 the wind plays tricks here plus the lights came in to play this is a tough outfield to play still i thought i had it because i saw it all the way
5930918 we tried to be greedy and try to get the runner at second base and that opened the gates for four runs
5930919 a team like the cubs an offensive team you cant give them any extra outs because they know how to capitalize
5930920 thats as good as johnny has thrown since the beginning of the year
5930921 he gave up two leadoff doubles in a row third and fourth and didnt give up anything but then he gave up a leadoff triple in the fifth and its hard to keep getting out of that kind of trouble
5930922 the guys told me before the game i was facing good hitters and i told them i dont care im going to throw a good game i lost and i feel good but i threw one of my best games this year
5930923 the problem has always been with size the fact is clothes made overseas are just too large for the japanese body
5930924 unfair and inaccurate to call taos products vintage or recycled products what theyre creating is something completely new

5930933 being around the guys is a real good distraction and really helps take my mind off everything
5930934 i love what i do and this gives me an opportunity to do what my dad would want me to do
5930935 this was important to him and he said he watched every game it was part of his routine he was a hard worker too one of those guys who did it every single day then come looking forward to watching my game
5930936 i got a lot done saturday and sunday a lot of extra everything im happy i got those two pinch hit at bats and plenty of other stuff
5930937 i like to have one to take pressure off my bullpen but its hard to get one when pitch counts are high
5930938 reminds me of my last year in chicago when i had one very similar there were 80 some starts of five innings or less
5930939 a bunch of starts by first year players 37 starts by rookie pitchers this year
5930940 they all seem to have one big high count inning and what it has done is put a whole bunch of pressure on the bullpen
5930941 its those starts of five innings or less that kill you
5930942 he is from just up the river from cincinnati and was a reds fan and wanted to pitch for the reds before he was drafted by arizona baker said
5930943 considering what edinson has done 15 5 2 73 era on a team not in first place last place he should get consideration
5930944 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
5930945 i kind of feel like its like that already people are underage drinking all the time people may go a little crazy i dont know if it would be the best idea as people might go nuts
5930946 i think people do it more because they like to rebel so they like to do things i think its a very good idea
5930947 if you go downtown on any thursday friday or saturday night now youll see there are a lot of persons 18 or 19 who are now illegally drinking
5930948 basically theyve just been driving for a couple of years if they are able to get the alcohol legally and start experimenting with that and then get behind the car thats a whole other issue
5930949 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
5930950 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
5930951 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
5930952 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
5930953 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own

5930957 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5930958 im not trying to create any expectation around the time line its possible we may have a decision by friday
5930959 were waiting for the process with the taskforce which is visiting the member nations to be concluded and then we will be making a decision at the end of that process
5930960 we will be recommending that players dont travel to pakistan and that hasnt changed
5930961 icc sent their taskforce out here on thursday we heard what they had to say and we fully accept that the security plans that have been designed are of a very high level

5930973 i know that stuff happens sometimes but catching routine fly balls should not be that much of a problem
5930974 i really had no idea that he would throw me out
5930975 he made an unbelievable play i saw it on the replay he slid on his knees barehanded it and threw a strike the way were swinging the bats right now i thought being aggressive was the best option
5930976 every night that you lose it makes it more difficult
5930977 its really comforting to know theyre giving me a couple of games to see how it goes
5930978 thats the best part for me because ive already started my routine for the next five days and its nice knowing im going to be here
5930979 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later
5930980 hes a guy thats been here for a long time my heart goes out to him because i know what he has had to go through this year
5930981 i think it was just so new to me last year i didnt know what to expect
5930982 now i know what boston does this team is here to win and produce championships and to be a part of that sometimes nerves might get the better of you
5930983 tough to swallow whenever you go out there and you have a game plan and execute it and it still doesnt work out
5930984 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5930985 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5930986 his way of managing was his way of managing and during that time you could do it i think he has freely admitted that you couldnt do it now dick talks to me now more than when i was a player
5930987 its just one day and obviously this has been a tough stretch
5930988 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5930989 you take a look around and see what it all is and get a little perspective
5930990 but at the same time this is a once in a lifetime thing and i find that the more experiences you take in the better you are as a person you cant miss the games we saw the 100 meters how unreal is that fastest man alive
5930991 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5930992 dont bother me im caught up in your legs i dont want to get out
5930993 weve been running ever since we came here many years ago
5930994 now the whole world wanna know how we running so they say there must be something in the air down there in jamaica that make jamaicans run like the wind
5930995 quarrie winning gold in the 200 in the 1976 olympics and silver in the 100 was a catapult for a lot of kids who thought if i work hard i can be like don quarrie
5930996 now youre going to have more kids being spurred on to be the next usain bolt
5930997 according to this theory right handed people are thought to process information using a
5930998 those are issues that he has to deal with but i dont know that theyre political issues
5930999 its not that i dont think it has a bearing on the race im sort of against kicking people when theyre down its not the nice thing to do
5931000 if other people are doing it for you you dont need to do it for yourself and you can take the high road
5931001 i dont know that id really use that as something to hit him over the head with
5931002 shed probably see that were already doing what shes talking about
5931003 we have done over and above our call to duty
5931004 its just a charge the judicial system has this great thing called innocent until proven guilty it will play out in the judicial system just like it should
5931005 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
5931006 if you have a green party i want to join
5931007 this is a gathering spot where people can talk and eat and enjoy all sorts of different music and art
5931008 since then weve just been watching the market build and build and build again and so it is really time for a correction
5931009 si hubieran sido todos ajustes de cuentas de violencia de g nero o el resultado de atracos podr a se alarse un problema previo sobre el que actuar retoma p rez pero lo cierto es que cada caso es un mundo la v ctima el autor sus circunstancias el m vil una deuda de seis euros puede ser una an cdota o un desencadenante puedes prever un aumento de carteristas pero no uno de homicidios

5931017 the single smartest move ever made by a television network
5931018 i feel like if majority of americans can accept these pedophile catholic priests molesting and raping their children then i should be able to heal those emotional scars through my music and literature without censorship issues
5931019 these whacked out parents dont understand the mentalities and the emotional needs of their own children said newt they dont take the necessary time to learn about what they created there are reasons why kids go to school and shoot everybody up there was a reason my homegirl blew her head off her shoulders there is a reason why a three year old girl starts crying when you leave her alone with her grandfather i am just giving you the reasons why
5931020 i dont care what people may say or think about who i am what i am or what i am about i refuse to let the opinions and comments of others deter me from my mission and vision im always gonna stand up for what i believe in even if im the only one standing
5931021 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5931022 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5931023 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5931024 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
5931025 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5931026 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5931027 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5931028 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5931029 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5931030 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5931031 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5931032 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5931033 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5931034 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5931035 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5931036 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5931037 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5931038 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5931039 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5931040 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5931041 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5931042 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5931043 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5931044 who are open to doing something on the production side
5931045 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5931046 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5931047 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5931048 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5931049 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5931050 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5931051 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5931052 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5931053 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5931054 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5931055 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5931056 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5931057 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5931058 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5931059 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5931060 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5931061 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5931062 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5931063 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5931064 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5931065 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5931066 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5931067 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5931068 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5931069 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5931070 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5931071 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5931072 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5931073 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5931074 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5931075 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5931076 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5931077 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5931078 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5931079 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5931080 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5931081 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5931082 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5931083 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5931084 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5931085 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5931086 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5931087 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5931088 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5931089 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5931090 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5931091 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5931092 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5931093 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5931094 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5931095 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5931096 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5931097 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5931098 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5931099 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5931100 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5931101 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5931102 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5931103 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5931104 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5931105 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5931106 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5931107 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5931108 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5931109 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5931110 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start

5931117 all were talking about here is the processing of a mineral which was really brought into south australia in the first place
5931118 but what were going to see is a lot more minerals mined in this state and exported from this state
5931119 so i dont think one should see some fine tuning at a refinery at port pirie in the context of the broader future of the mining industry
5931120 its much too premature to be talking about that this studys underway its going to take them three months or so to look at their operations
5931121 theyve been upfront in public in saying what theyre looking at and i think we obviously need to await the outcome of that

5931140 in a recent trade ad pictured above no technical specs about the release aside from that it will be on a 2 disc set that includes a
5931141 will be mostly an entertaining show while it did get a bit tiring seeing a sort of creature of the week type show the plots presented are worth the time invested for fans the characters are interesting and of most note is that actor
5931142 as lex luthor plays the flash here villain on one vs hero on another
5931143 is rewarded for this span of 26 episodes across only three discs fans of the show will definitely be pleased with what they get here visually
5931144 typically do lack a real sense of atmosphere usually relying on a frontal setup
5931145 is unfortunately all i can reward this dolby digital 5 1 ancient track that was originally probably on the dvd release
5931146 and also not the first time cameron diazs significant other committed something regretful in vegas
5931147 for complimenting the film well in moments to make you feel realistically in the las vegas or new york city settings but due to the films material there are no actions invoking jaw dropping audio

5931150 this 2008 film is a remake of the same titled movie that was made in 1980 which currently has a 5 0 avg on imdb apparently making the remake only slightly worse than the original three years ago donna
5931151 just only ummm bad why is it that every single hollywood horror film nowadays has to rely on such simply plot devices and instead doesnt go for the genuine scare instead is it just that american directors are lazy and cant seem to direct horror anymore perhaps they should take a hint from directors like the orphanage
5931152 but each and every move she makes in this movie is almost worth a laugh
5931153 is a real big disappointment granted i didnt go into the movie with high expectations but i figured
5931154 makes a solid enough transition from its 35mm print to hi def
5931155 so to speak until street date so i cant tell you if this features any title specific content yet but ill be sure to update this after it has been released

5931160 again for this as it still continues to impress me every time i see it even more so now on
5931161 is an interactive feature that lets you view high def cg models of the
5931162 as i said about them on the previously released hd dvd review the inclusion of

5931174 and the ultra famous industrial light and magic on your team you know something special is going to occur
5931175 is just as good as the original film if not slightly better
5931176 and one of the original definitions of the term rock star the film starts out with his own voice over narration done by actor
5931177 as a band makes for an excellent film that is best suited for those with an open minded sense of thinking it shows tribute obviously to the late
5931178 the band included no bassist this does its job quite well in delivering the musical and dramatic film from
5931179 which i can now see that comparison this proves to have a great cast with great witty dialogue that offers some unexpected comedic relief at times
5931180 overall for audio quality on this release which seems low for a pcm 5 1 lossless track but does manage to deliver the film pretty well regardless of my few rants
5931181 with its somewhat interesting plot might not be that bad of a movie perhaps
5931182 so to speak until street date so i cant tell you if this features any title specific content yet but ill be sure to update this after it has been released

5931187 sending americas vital energy resources overseas during our time of need should stop
5931188 that export level amounts to nearly 10 percent of all the oil the united states consumes every day
5931189 rather than being shipped overseas that oil should remain here at home to help american consumers who are facing record energy prices
5931190 one ninth the amount of oil we currently send to foreign countries every day
5931191 we have to export oil because we cant refine it said
5931192 if jesus died for our sins wouldnt his death be senseless if we not commit them
5931193 why are we being billed for something we didnt want
5931194 makes a solid transfer to hi def especially when you consider that the film was low budget
5931195 so to speak until street date so i cant tell you if this features any title specific content yet but ill be sure to update this after it has been released
5931196 stefan sonnenfeld and company 3 and i have worked for the last three months to get the print looking like what you saw no matter how good the cinematography is there is new potential to make the image more impactful beyond what you can do on location or on the set so when you do blu ray you have an up rezing quality so things that were sharp before become sharper
5931197 according to the article obviously no technical specs have been announced yet as this title isnt due out until

5931205 perhaps companies will want to put wind turbines atop bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out off the atlantic coast where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy
5931206 but we can work on using less and in new york were determined to do what no other city has ever attempted and that is to keep our energy usage at or near its current level even as our population grows
5931207 new york city is going to make money by being green
5931208 and thats the message we want to send to the private sector as well you can have it both ways
5931209 theres a lot of logistical as well as esthetic considerations off shore is much more likely

5931363 i imagined that i was driving in the playstation game ridge racer
5931364 stars such as debbie harry patti smith and jane birkin had distinct looks and their own natural styles but madonna really entered into the fashion world her relationship with gaultier made her like the supermodels of the time its never a catwalk look its creating a whole new self and exploiting cultural references to get this self talked about in doing so she transformed herself into a brand
5931365 idolising her awareness of visual style her sensibilities her forever moving forward i never dreamed id get to work with her

5931368 as someone who has just turned 40 im really bored by being told whats right for a certain age we should wear what we want to wear madonnas body may be unique but we can all learn something from her spirit of transformation her attitude
5931369 no one else is able to do that reinvention and thats what fashion is

5931374 you cant count on hot water a lot of time the water that comes out is dark brown and starts lightening up only after 20 minutes im lactose intolerant and need a special diet but over there i had to learn to live with what was available
5931375 i grew up in a place like this where everyone i knew went to space
5931376 i always assumed that my future would include going into space
5931377 but i went from shock to dismay to who is he to tell me what i cant do
5931378 im spending the majority of my money to do this
5931379 ive got three more to go the space station everest and the lunar surface
5931380 im the one going to space unless this guy breaks my legs
5931381 there is nothing the right seat person is doing that couldnt be done by one of the other crew members

5931400 if anyone got on he was going to be in the game
5931401 it was very similar to the groin strain i had in may it was something i felt like i could pitch through youre accepting responsibility when you take the mound at full speed or half speed and thats why i never wanted to make a big deal about it if it was significant enough to make a big deal about i should take myself out of the game

5931410 have worked hard so they probably dont feel like theres anything else they can do right now theyve practiced hard and invested the work so now its time to game plan and execute the game plan

5931419 responding to questions about whether sen john mccain had an unfair advantage over sen barack obama at saturdays forum on faith at the saddleback church in california
5931420 arlington va how unprofessional was it for andrea mitchell and nbc news to air anonymous allegations that mccain had cheated and heard the questions in advance during saturdays event wouldnt an unbiased discussion have included denials from the mccain campaign instead of being a stenographer for the obama campaign shouldnt she have done some reporting on the subject checking out the room etc before spouting their spin on nationwide tv

5931427 lawmakers has virtually no plot to speak of but is composed of many loosely connected scenes each of which touches vaguely on a different aspect of american life and culture
5931428 though i found much of this experience to be esoteric and hard to follow there are some moments of brilliance that deserve mention

5931435 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5931436 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5931437 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5931438 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5931439 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5931440 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5931441 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time

5931453 son speros con buena talla y mucha experiencia pero tenemos muy buenas chances de pasar no en vano nosotros fuimos dos y ellos tres en su grupo
5931454 son un equipo sin grandes individualidades no tienen los jugadores esos que pueden crear un tiro en cualquier momento y desbordar por s mismos
5931455 vamos a tratar de interrumpirles su juego y su movilidad para lograr que esa peque a falencia que tienen pueda quedar en evidencia y as poder sacar provecho de eso

5931457 i was bound hand and foot assaulted and abused by army personnel
5931458 the main area of concern of our side was the product support required for indigenous production of t 90 tanks the main issues were related to the delivery of ventilation torsion bar gun barrels and anti aircraft gun mounts
5931459 the russian side agreed that the delivery schedule mutually accepted in the sub group meeting of land systems in june 2008 will be maintained the indian side stressed the urgent requirement of specification of t 90 gun barrels the russian side agreed to deliver the document by december 2008
5931460 the working group also discussed about mrta multi role transport aircraft that will be jointly developed by india and russia another meeting to further discuss the modalities would take place next month
5931461 admiral mehta will be visiting japan and south korea aug 19 24 taking further the indian navys endeavour the indian ocean naval symposium ions held last year
5931462 the navy chief will also visit the yokohoma shipyard the frontline ships of japanese navy and japanese naval bases
5931463 in south korea the navy chief will visit the submarines of the south korean navy and meet its minister of defence he will also visit the south korean naval academy
5931464 the three ships will come off mumbai coast and on their way out will engage in an exercise with indian navy ships ins beas and ins godavari the jds asagiri and jds umigiri are equipped with harpoon sea sparrow missiles and sea hawk helicopters
5931465 the ships will be conducting flying operations cross deck operations and over the head targeting exercise
5931466 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5931467 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5931468 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5931469 this community will be discussing what measures will be taken in response to the contempt for democracy that has been reflected in the position by self appointed prime minister commodore frank bainimarama
5931470 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
5931471 we will be discussing today and tomorrow the forum countries reaction to that
5931472 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5931473 therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle
5931474 certainly we would be addressing what the next steps would be
5931475 he tests the strength and relevance of the forum and as a consequence we will have to address that very issue tomorrow
5931476 president mwanawasa was a champion of democracy in his own country and throughout africa
5931477 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
5931478 his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people
5931479 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5931480 supplies were disrupted to the entire jammu and kashmir just not the valley
5931481 the state has 22 districts of which the 10 in jammu and two in the ladakh region were equally affected
5931482 around 2 800 trucks carrying essential commodities like fuel and medicine have come to the valley
5931483 around 3 300 fruit and vegetable laden trucks left the valley during the same period for different parts of north india
5931484 some disruption on the jammu srinagar national highway otherwise we used to get 1 000 trucks per day going to the valley
5931485 my vehicle was stoned and i saved myself by ducking
5931486 we were carrying supplies for them and they beat us up
5931487 even now if they call it an economic blockade and fuel the fire in kashmir on a non issue this is the most unfortunate thing to happen
5931488 the world has been seeing and reporting the economic blockade enforced by the extremist forces in jammu against the valley people it was their frustrations and they cannot deny what is the writing on the wall
5931489 will the isi try to take advantage of this volatile and potentially volcanic situation i have no doubt they will
5931490 its in vital interest of india to defuse the situation in kashmir before long the issue will be internationalised as long as this pot is on boil the capacity for mischief on part of the isi will be boundless
5931491 political transition in pakistan and future of india pakistan relations
5931492 and what better issue than kashmir to whip nationalistic frenzy
5931493 domestic tensions must be curbed the sentiments of both jammu and the valley have to be addressed some semblance of normalcy has to be restored
5931494 the crisis in kashmir portents of war hopes of peace
5931495 much will depend on to what extent asif ali zardari co chairman of pakistan peoples party and nawaz sharif leader of pakistan muslim league nawaz can move beyond their past
5931496 neither of them has any experience in running a coalition if they continue to squabble this coalition will unravel in a year
5931497 the united states has a keen national security interest in the affairs of pakistan due to its nuclear arsenal and the fact that it borders india which is also a nuclear power
5931498 india and pakistan have been embroiled in a long standing dispute over kashmir
5931499 allowing terrorists to grasp pakistans nuclear weapons must not happen
5931500 he has sought a peaceful relationship with india and despite much domestic resistance has tried to bring the border regions under control
5931501 musharraf believing that he was the best ally for the fight against al qaeda and the taliban
5931502 and pakistans people deeply resent washington for propping up the dictator
5931503 focus american policy on his dangerous and dangerously neglected country
5931504 pakistans newly elected civilian leaders must also move quickly to challenge taliban and al qaeda forces who threaten their own countrys stability and the pakistani intelligence and military officers who are in league with them
5931505 a spent force after he declared a state of emergency in november in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to sideline opponents

5931509 the miscreants attracted a large shia crowd at the hospital by killing one of their leaders and then carried out the suicide bombing maximising the damage
5931510 more such attacks will be carried out if the military operation in bajaur and swat districts are not halted
5931511 we will launch countrywide attacks on government installations for which the government would be responsible
5931512 algeria can count on europe for its support in the fight against terrorism
5931513 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time
5931514 searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception
5931515 we get it off their balance sheet and we take on the management duties
5931516 i believe if i wasnt in this group i would be in juvenile detention or jail
5931517 it has helped me focus on what i want to achieve
5931518 you allow them to set their own rules and be expressive but in a controlled way
5931519 we work together as a team but its their show and they understand that
5931520 the media has picked up something that was already an issue and this has affected the perception of the funders
5931521 they have classed the carnival project as high risk because ours is the only float that consists 100 of youth
5931522 its a last minute fight we have got all the top urban artists who play for free for us but no platform for them to perform on
5931523 we have children coming from all different postcodes and most from hackney and islington probably two of the most deprived areas of london
5931524 everything you hear about young people is negative these children come and work together and there are no arguments or problems
5931525 we have had some children who knew someone killed in the area we have discussions about it and on issues like friendship choices you make in life and what are you doing for the community
5931526 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up

5931553 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5931554 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5931555 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels

5931559 the shortage of interpreters will pose a problem because its already difficult enough to get to guantanamo and to see ones client
5931560 if we got them to change the rules the number of hours and we worked new york lawyers hours instead of a european auto plant workers schedule there would be less of a problem
5931561 i expected the type of criticism i would get and decided it was worth it
5931562 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
5931563 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
5931564 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
5931565 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
5931566 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
5931567 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
5931568 having put together the list over the past two years we contacted those folks directly
5931569 and that lowered the number of broker transactions that would have been done once we move through the list and exhaust the list we will continue to enhance the relationship with the prince georges brokers
5931570 i feel that we should get some of the listing business not just at national harbor but at woodmore towne centre at glenarden places where there is a public private partnership where county funds are being used
5931571 the idea behind economic development in the county is for other businesses that are in the county to benefit from the project
5931572 board does not solicit business for members we are all competitors
5931573 coalition governments are by definition fractious when they come together there is bound to be disagreement on how to resolve certain issues and how to address certain problems
5931574 so far off the mark as to be incomprehensible and useless
5931575 were talking costs in the thousands of dollars not in the millions of dollars
5931576 if it did nothing else i thought it was a deterrent the prospect of its imposition would prevent the wrongful taking of human life but that was then
5931577 how in the end does killing its citizens help the state to build the nonviolent just and civil society that we all desire for ourselves and for our children
5931578 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
5931579 police officers play a critical role but if they abuse our community they will not be trusted
5931580 with this kind of incident people are not going to trust
5931581 maybe it has something to do with the fact theyre not as alert because theyve already worked an eight hour shift or are working on what would have been their day off
5931582 even when were working secondary employment were still police officers
5931583 the schools of the district of columbia have suffered decades of neglect since i have been facilities director my team and i have worked tirelessly to make sure that we are providing the best environments possible for students we are the first to say we have a long way to go

5931589 we ask that you and your staff will dedicate a portion of that sacred day to community service honoring the spirit of unity that brought our nation together in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
5931590 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state
5931591 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
5931592 provide a nonpartisan forum for you to address the events of 9 11 and the importance of national service

5931598 he has been working to keep our energy costs down and increase our access to clean renewable fuels for our cars and energy for our homes in one way or another since 1988
5931599 his reputation as one of the states leading environmental voices and his experience and relationships here in harrisburg with legislators stakeholders and the administration will prove to be a valuable asset as we work to make a better cleaner and healthier pennsylvania for our 12 4 million residents
5931600 i urge the senate to act promptly and confirm his nomination
5931601 with john hangers strong background on energy issues through his work on the puc and with pennfuture we will expect energy to be front and center during his tenure as dep secretary
5931602 when i would disagree with him instead of making logical arguments to change my mind he would say i was in the pocket of the polluters that i take money from polluters and thats why i vote this way
5931603 that doesnt get a dialogue going its offensive you can say im wrong or you can say im stupid but dont say im corrupt
5931604 hes a very intelligent guy i just dont know if hes somebody we can work with
5931605 a pragmatist who recognizes the economic opportunities we can gain while protecting our natural resources
5931606 he didnt toot his own horn very much but i know he was very proud of the successes he had at the law firm
5931607 he told me he wanted to live to be 65 and if he didnt leave the firm he wouldnt make it
5931608 he always enjoyed helping younger lawyers and many of them have told me he was a mentor for them and a help to them
5931609 he wanted to practice law as honestly as he could and he wanted to take care of his family which he did nicely
5931610 while pheaas mission remains beyond reproach the agency has lost its focus
5931611 many of pheaas leaders seem to have put their self interest ahead of the needs of pennsylvania students
5931612 if we change the governance lets just make sure we understand what that means before we proceed
5931613 what you have to look at is whats really happened going forward our board and our management and our employees are dedicated to reform
5931614 above all he does believe he can help in some way and he has truly done that hes put that belief in something concrete
5931615 up to 12 million more people can be treated using these highly effective drugs with the available donor funding this means that up to 40 000 lives can be saved
5931616 thats important because of the foundations buyers consortium of 69 countries which trust us
5931617 i was tapped to lead the program for the first year i was basically a one man team in terms of what i had to do i had to develop a strategy establish the corporate foundation relationships and negotiate the deals
5931618 one of the neat aspects of the clinton foundation is that it brings a business oriented perspective
5931619 with the itch to again apply his business skills to social problems
5931620 i had the great opportunity of studying at a medical school
5931621 the health sciences program was trained along medical school students in the medical school we even did clinical rotations so we got to deal with patients
5931622 the entrepreneurial bug bit me when i started the foundation
5931623 in a year it became the largest community service organization on campus and i incorporated it
5931624 i think my parents having been raised in india and witnessed tragedies like hunger poor education have instilled in us an awareness or concern for the plight of others
5931625 they encouraged us to volunteer we both volunteered at the hospital
5931626 i think they just taught us that every contribution is important and inder brought that to a different level in college and in his career as well
5931627 i guess thats what a library is supposed to be
5931628 who knows i may be lucky and see anna mae there shes 92 you know and im 81 so i think i should be able to keep up with her for a lap or two
5931629 ive never had any trouble like that at the store
5931630 with the closing of the financing we are excited to restart construction immediately and build and operate a world class facility of which pittsburghers can be proud
5931631 some of those guys were past their lines of credit
5931632 they needed this money to operate their business not this job their business
5931633 this is a great day i got an e mail earlier today saying they had closed and the money would be wired im just waiting for the controller to come into my office to say we got it i just have to hear those words
5931634 its going to take some schedule acceleration whether its working saturdays or doing some double shift work we dont know yet but something is going to be required
5931635 as she was lying in the hospital bed two weeks before she died patients were coming in to see her and she was asking them if they were still taking their medications and how their husband was doing
5931636 she was too young and too talented to go so soon
5931637 she was not fast was always late and always took her time doing things but she always looked immaculate when she left the house
5931638 if she had something to do she would spend all night doing it
5931639 she was very good under pressure to come up with great things
5931640 cancer is an ugly disease but it brought out the beauty in donna the beauty of her spirit
5931641 i am a working guy i have a family and kids in college
5931642 councilman mcculloughs family and mine have been friends for more than 30 years
5931643 a judge may have to determine whether two council members can have such a relationship
5931644 you had to know by calling murderers that they would handle the situation like they usually do
5931645 now youre sorry for what happened well guess what so am i
5931646 i do apologize to the lady that lost her sons i have to live with that every day of my life
5931647 im not a cruel person i dream about the homicides all the time
5931648 i truly think theyre sorry but i also think they knew what was going to happen
5931649 i have to forgive all of them because if i cant forgive them god cant forgive me
5931650 i dont know what the future is going to hold
5931651 whose business commitments and travel obligations necessitated an independent study that was in excess of allowable independent study credits
5931652 when i think of mark the first word that comes to mind is decency
5931653 we are not going to discuss the process in depth
5931654 it didnt work as it should have in this case and were looking at it
5931655 this looks from the outside like a pretty decisive action
5931656 unlike a couple of other instances of these issues popping up where institutions dragged their heels and meandered as they dealt with the crisis it seemed like the institution did act swiftly
5931657 even if theres an error in judgment why does it warrant such harsh treatment
5931658 he was a person who challenged you to do the best and take the most difficult courses
5931659 i was in the masters program and took ph d classes because mark wanted me to do my best
5931660 i thought he would have a flourishing career at cmu he really cared about that place and cared about his students
5931661 we always learn about the food pyramid in school but its boring so we dont remember it
5931662 obesity is a silent disease because nobody wants to talk about it
5931663 medicine has needed designers for a long time to help deliver the information that we already know is important that is the biggest dilemma
5931664 this game is all encompassing and helps us deliver the information
5931665 it teaches you how to be healthy without it being really confusing it is important to know what the right balance is for everyone
5931666 every kid who gets the talk will also get the game that the whole family can play together its a holistic way to talk about getting healthy
5931667 in the future we would like to get the support of insurance companies so that physicians can get trained to teach simple nutrition to kids
5931668 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
5931669 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
5931670 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
5931671 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
5931672 we would get things almost every day from people all over the country
5931673 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
5931674 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people
5931675 there is just so much these days with the internet and web sites and blogs but this was a story about a kid who was just so real that it grabs you
5931676 i know pittsburgh is probably all concerned about what the steelers are going to be like this fall and how maybe the penguins couldve done things differently in the stanley cup but this kids story was just so different
5931677 the story that the post gazette did started the fire for this kid if maybe i threw another log on to help get it going more then great because it deserved to be a bonfire
5931678 you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
5931679 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be
5931680 i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
5931681 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
5931682 he said he just wanted to meet john coach maddon has really become touched by john and his message
5931683 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
5931684 now john had no idea about these madonna and a rod rumors about an affair and john goes so wheres your wife i couldnt believe it but a rod just said she was in florida at their other home with their kids
5931685 then john asked him if his wife worked john wasnt trying to be smart he was just curious he told john that she didnt work but that she had a psychology degree
5931686 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
5931687 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5931688 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5931689 if i can help someone else going through this then that would make me feel good
5931690 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is
5931691 this represents a milestone in the development struggle of the hill district but it does not represent the end
5931692 the struggle is not over we have a lot more work to do at every level
5931693 we want to work together with you with the residents of the hill district to build a new city on the hill and i think this agreement today allows us to do so
5931694 that was roughly as long as the one they use to launch the space shuttle
5931695 it depends on the time of year whether its flu season time for seasonal allergies or with our younger population time for physicals
5931696 we cant treat sprains strains or fractures because we have no x ray machines
5931697 the other things that people ask for all the time and that we dont do are pain medications especially for migraines
5931698 for those who dont know what our service includes an electronic message board spools the information and some people just want direction on what the next step in taking care of themselves would be
5931699 are great for people who are relatively healthy but once youre taking multiple medications or have multiple chronic conditions you should be seeing your primary care doctor
5931700 if you dont have a medical home we try to direct you toward one
5931701 twenty out of 22 departures will be cancelled we have two early morning flights to port blair and mumbai which depart before 6 am when the strike starts these will not be cancelled
5931702 there will also be a bandh across the city and hence none of our employees will be able to come for work hence there will be no operations from kolkata tomorrow we have a similar case in bagdogra where all our flights will be cancelled
5931703 due to the strike we have rescheduled our kolkata flight to august 21 the flight which was to arrive at the airport on the night of august 20 will now arrive on the 21st
5931704 we have a contingency plan in place we will do rostering of staff adequately so that no inconvenience takes place
5931705 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
5931706 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with bonita dania
5931707 whats the point in releasing 200 prisoners when israel is continuing to build in the settlements although its a positive step i dont see how its going to bring us closer to peace
5931708 israel is today releasing 200 prisoners to make room in its prisons for the hundreds of palestinians who were arrested by the israeli army in the past few weeks
5931709 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5931710 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5931711 youve got to win some series here otherwise you can start thinking about next year
5931712 a lot of first basemen give up on that ball and let the right fielder get it
5931713 it was just going through my mind just try to keep him off second
5931714 walking into the stadium they have these two semi truck trailers with speakers stacked as high as you can possibly imagine just pumping out reggae music
5931715 the stadium is packed and everyone is partying during the game anywhere near your net and its like theyre trying to suck the ball into the back of your net its just incredible
5931716 if canada loses to jamaica wednesday night it will be as good as saying they will probably not qualify for the world cup
5931717 this game for my money is a must win situation
5931718 this is the first time i think were going to have a pro canadian crowd and i think for the guys thats very special
5931719 the support that they will have will be huge for them the referees in this area are heavily influenced by the crowd and hopefully we can influence them because normally we dont
5931720 i think the attention the team has got is good i think the guys deserve it and its been a while since theyve played any games in canada
5931721 we got to go and take advantage of the spotlight and go out and perform
5931722 we certainly dont encourage employees to get physically confrontational with suspects but they have the legal right to do so
5931723 picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
5931724 picture yourself on a train in a station with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
5931725 its 5 oclock i want to shoot everyone and go around them

5931727 the congressional freshman orientation at harvard doesnt cost millions of dollars but even the thousands of dollars of tax money used for this congressional boondoggle sets a bad example for new members of congress

5931730 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
5931731 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
5931732 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
5931733 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
5931734 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
5931735 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
5931736 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
5931737 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together

5931772 these cases are only the latest incidents in an intensifying government campaign to undermine malaysias vibrant and growing community of online commentators
5931773 we call on the malaysian authorities to stop harassing bloggers and uphold the spirit of the governments 1996 policy pledge not to censor the internet
5931774 it cools me off after a long night of pouring beers for everyone else
5931775 if this were doom and gloom we wouldnt be doing it
5931776 though i think in a few years there will be a dance space because there are so many people in the community trying to make it happen
5931777 if you want to make art you make it any way you can
5931778 if youre not being presented at a certain moment its like screw it ill do it in my living room or in a warehouse or in the street theres been tons of that going on philadelphia for years thats the big thing working with whats in front of you instead of waiting for someone to present you
5931779 thats one of the amazing things about fringe founder and director nick stuccio and the fringe festival
5931780 sometimes they act as if theyre invisible even though theyre not
5931781 its about what people become when they get into their cars
5931782 we generally did two to three rehearsals a week but since june were in lockdown mode ive been rehearsing with two full casts so i rehearse three hours with one cast then three hours with the other cast at least a few days a week
5931783 then there are weeks that we have intensives and work every day
5931784 to be honest i had done a lot of dance pieces and they left a funky taste in my mouth
5931785 my issue is and people have said this to me that a lot of people have done it and everyone always feels like its an afterthought and it looks that way too
5931786 im really proud of that we work really hard on it
5931787 its more like shes doing a site specific dance piece within the video pieces that ive designed for the space thats why theyre so good
5931788 the goal is to make anonymous bodies a small core of dancers that i can have on salary it can be a full time company but i just dont have the financial wherewithal to give everyone full time jobs right now
5931789 but those are my peeps theyre my support system who make it happen
5931790 i think it has a lot to do with wanting audiences physically closer to the work and have a different experience
5931791 to not just sit but walk around the city go on a subway to experience performances in such a way that they arent just sitting and watching philadelphia artists are constantly pushing their audiences to see art in other ways
5931792 shes one of a bunch of artists in the city here whos been really investigating immersing the audience sort of participating rather than just spectating
5931793 thats a big thing nationally and internationally in the performance world i think her work is on the forefront of that
5931794 when you go to see her pieces it just feels really relevant that whats going on taps into our world and our lives thats not true for a lot of dance and even a lot of dance that i make
5931795 and thats not a bad thing often dance can be really esoteric and thats what can be so beautiful about it
5931796 you can make a site specific piece but still have the audience sitting there passively in seats quietly shes really changing the role of the audience it is a site specific piece but also more than that
5931797 it was always clear to me that kate had both strong performance presence and also strong creative ability which is what i look for in my group motion dancers in general but she emerged as someone with her own very particular voice
5931798 the fact that she has entered into site specific work doesnt surprise me she was always very interested in the juncture between art performance and real life
5931799 she was able to show she was making interesting and sophisticated decisions in her work
5931800 and shes so young and the potential in a young artist is always exciting for a panel but kate also seemed to have a certain control and awareness
5931801 listen guys there was some drinking of water and some shifting around youre equidistant from us at that point we can see you youve got to remember that its all a stage
5931802 belgiums answer to pina bausch laurie anderson peter brook and robert wilson
5931803 it must be tough to be european theres such a weight of tradition one feels compelled to overthrow
5931804 to work with corn in mexico is to enter a historic cultural political and economic world thats very complex something like how they talk about grapes in france
5931805 in philly i was working in cool restaurants along with nice people earning good money at alma de cuba sometimes i had eggs with a little salmon for breakfast now im working in the dust with animals eating corn tortillas and chilies as lunch but i decided to come back to see what i can do for my family and my community from here
5931806 is to help a few farmers market their product differently
5931807 a lot of third world development discourse is grow this grow that but the people of san mateo already know how to grow corn and since we dont have the power to overturn nafta which 99 9 percent of the time works against the community we can turn it into an advantage
5931808 for example with fair trade coffee from chiapas they give the growers a decent exchange rate but the buyer makes most of the money the cool thing about this project is its transnational wherever the money is made it stays in the community because they live here and in mexico
5931809 if you ask people from the north of mexico they probably will not know it only people from puebla oaxaca chiapas the areas with more tradition even in mexico city you wont see this
5931810 its like if you go to mexico city and find someone selling scrapple when i found out peter bloom was selling pinole i thought cool were a mexican restaurant i want to make something with it
5931811 insert name of reputable culinary publication or grilling chef here
5931812 theyre so big theyre huge ohmygod im freaking out we have to go
5931813 in philly if you have a backyard youre batshit insane to cook inside your house in the summer
5931814 it makes life a lot easier because you dont have to worry about prepping styles and technique
5931815 you cant beat people up and have them say i love you
5931816 son i love the way he sings this song but i always thought you did it better
5931817 sweetie i aint going to sugar coat it for ya i just plain forgot about ya
5931818 i dont know if i want you driving my car everytime you drive it you break it
5931819 this may be ascribed to the red necks a name bestowed upon the presbyterians in fayetteville

5931822 exxon has failed to show that any cercla authorized remediation effort or indeed any federal involvement whatsoever is implicated in this case with which the application of the villages nuisance ordinance could conflict
5931823 we have to get a picture together when its up right now its not looking very good
5931824 so it was you guys standing back there this whole time
5931825 are you guys going to be here all day then

5931840 well no i couldnt let you in your shoes are too dirty

5931842 goaded by john mccain who has been brilliantly resolute in his

5931886 these companies are making a lot of money by doing highly targeted and selective advertising of these products
5931887 in china india and other asian countries there is a strong preference for boys
5931888 this combination of a preference for boys and modern technology the ultrasound machine has proven deadly for millions upon millions of baby girls
5931889 in light of this what does it mean to love our neighbor how can we separate issues of environmentalism consumerism and materialism from genuine love for other human beings in particular the orphans widows and the oppressed
5931890 i just wish my children had died in my lap

5931915 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
5931916 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
5931917 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
5931918 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
5931919 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
5931920 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
5931921 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris britney ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
5931922 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
5931923 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
5931924 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
5931925 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
5931926 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
5931927 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
5931928 hes starting a blistering tv campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism
5931929 now john you know that every time he tries to get tough he quickly runs out of gas sometimes in debates hed be exhausted by the third question he must use up all his energy in the gym he doesnt have any stamina and he certainly doesnt have our bloodlust besides you can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos
5931930 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me
5931931 that was inspired to snatch his convention away makes him look so weak listen why dont you stop in sedona on the way to denver wear a black wig and ill spirit you up to the cabin for the night ill catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you it will be an adventure
5931932 glance into the world just as though time were gone and everything crooked will become straight to you
5931933 it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages
5931934 i believe amp i know god is in total control amp satan shudders at just the name of jesus christ
5931935 i will call you squishy and you will be mine
5931936 i will hug him and i will squeeze him call him george
5931937 on that ouija board of concerning were past overly yeah this is concerning no question about it
5931938 i cant control injuries but ive been hired to do a job
5931939 the next guy steps up and i have to do the best coaching job i can to play a tough opponent
5931940 its kind of a game time thing if youve got to scramble and make something happen with your feet then youve got to make something happen
5931941 ideally wed like to stay in there and hit things on time
5931942 i know hes a good player so thats just another guy weve got to worry about
5931943 i got home and immediately knew it wasnt gluten free
5931944 my friend barely made it out of the parking lot
5931945 four of those beds are on the surgical ward and these have been closed for some time because the government hasnt been able to recruit nurses to that area for a period of 18 months now
5931946 eight of those beds are closed in the childrens ward
5931947 over the last couple of months weve seen the loss of two medical registrars from the emergency department the hospital running at over 100 per cent capacity patients being transferred to outlying rural hospitals when they are from launceston and not st helens ambulance ramping outside the hospital and elective surgery lists cancelled regularly
5931948 what the minister fails to recognise is that bed shortages has a flow on effect to other workers at the hospital not to mention the general public and to do nothing apart from blame everyone else is not a good option
5931949 the fedora infrastructure team is currently investigating an issue in the infrastructure systems
5931950 that process may result in service outages for which we apologize in advance were still assessing the end user impact of the situation but as a precaution we recommend you not download or update any additional packages on your fedora systems
5931951 we know the community is awaiting more detail on the past weeks activities and their causes were preparing a timeline and details and will make them available in the near future we appreciate the communitys patience and will continue to post updates to the fedora announce list as soon as possible

5931954 but trying to keep a positive outlook i went with
5931955 here im the referee and i want a fair true portrait of the man how did bush go from an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world its like frank capra territory on one hand but ill also cover the demons in his private life his bouts with his dad and his conversion to christianity which explains a lot of where he is coming from it includes his belief that god personally chose him to be president of the united states and his coming into his own with the stunning preemptive attack on iraq it will contain surprises for bush supporters and his detractors
5931956 the film tells the story of a man with an iq of 75 and his epic journey through life meeting historical figures influencing popular culture and experiencing first hand historic events while being largely unaware of their significance due to his lower than average intelligence
5931957 he was a fine singer who made a great contribution to the opera stages of the world
5931958 its the single best management team in all of baseball maybe all of sports
5931959 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be but i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
5931960 he was going to come out for a couple days and i was going to put him on a deer
5931961 i knew the chances werent real good that he would make it and it didnt work out god had another plan for him
5931962 what john brought all of us for the day he was with us the courage he showed the message he had its something well never forget
5931963 the number of lives that he touched in a short period of time is phenomenal i think if he was sitting here today if he could talk to us he would say dont fret he did all he wanted to do
5931964 but everything seems to be going as well as expected the doctors told us it went perfect
5931965 which the doctor said you couldnt have put a bullet or a needle in a worse spot
5931966 i think the whole team was not good especially me because hes almost like a second son to me
5931967 the most competitive marketplace online for sellers and the best place for buyers to find bargains
5931968 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5931969 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5931970 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5931971 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5931972 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5931973 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5931974 it really just displays our patriotism throughout the voting process
5931975 this is the first edition of monopoly that is worldwide
5931976 basically theyll reflect iconic images from each of the continents
5931977 every city will have a token that will be iconic to their city
5931978 we hope that fans of the worlds most popular board game will enjoy buying selling and trading real estate from around the globe in the new monopoly game that they created with their votes
5931979 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcase the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
5931980 this is a serious issue that has been raised by teachers and it has to be taken seriously not in a childish way that some academic wants to raise
5931981 this would encourage the speedy integration of these students into the school community and into mainstream subject classes
5931982 would not injure or interfere with the medieval town defences of cashel
5931983 it justifies everything we have done in the campaign we have been running against the proposed development called on cashel town council to liaise with community groups about the future use of the former convent lands
5931984 now that pleanala has made its decision the town council should chart a course ahead for the land with all relevant community groups including the save our town park committee it is essential the community is united over whatever plans are devised
5931985 the fact remains that cashel does not have sufficient tourist accommodation the rock of cashel receives a quarter of a million tourists a year and the town still needs a hotel i would urge the town council and the community to work towards a solution in this regard
5931986 its very important to us to show the world that our footballers and our people can still do their jobs in spite of what has happened
5931987 the fifa decision has come as a shock to me and to all of the people of georgia because we hoped to play this game against ireland in tbilisi right now they say that we cannot play but i dont know what the situation will be in three weeks
5931988 we are in contact with our government and with people who can advise us on whether the irish team might arrive in tbilisi but i dont think any decision on what to do will be made for another day or two we can appeal but im not so sure that fifa would change their mind
5931989 its hugely disappointing because its our first qualifier a crucial game and we worked very hard at the fixtures meeting
5931990 but we have a bigger situation back at home and it wont matter where we play the players will use this as a bigger motivation against ireland to get a result
5931991 but what can i do ive said before that a decision was needed and that its important to respect the calendar group schedule
5931992 playing on the 6th of september is important but first we have the game tomorrow then we can talk of the 6th of september
5931993 that we start with the first course and then we go on
5931994 the players were looking forward to playing the two games ireland play montenegro four days after georgia i know its not in georgia now but the reality is that the decisions been made and we have to respect it its been out of our hands
5931995 the reality is that a decision had to be made for the safety of the players the fans who were going to travel over there and even the media
5931996 after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5931997 aryzta will be the leader in value added baked goods serving over 200 000 customers across the globe
5931998 we will seek to build on the excellent track record of iaws and hiestand to deliver significant value creation to iaws and hiestand shareholders and bring strategic benefits for employees and customers
5931999 i would like to apologise that the people of the town have been without water the council have been working night and day
5932000 what happened was that the filtration system wasnt able actually to take the flow of the water
5932001 the majority of the water used in the mallow area is actually river based and the filters were not able to cope
5932002 i have been dressed in what is an explosive belt which the kidnappers say will be detonated if there is an attempt to storm the area
5932003 they say they are ready to turn the hideout into what they describe as a death zone if there is an attempt to free me by force it seems the answer is to return to negotiations which i am told are very close to achieving a deal
5932004 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5932005 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5932006 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia
5932007 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond
5932008 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5932009 the russian occupation of my country is untenable it cannot be sustained
5932010 this will give them a voice and they will no longer be part of a group that is represented internationally as being unable to speak for themselves
5932011 when the world congress takes place here the people of ireland are going to learn that disability is a bit of a misnomer here they have a capacity for independent living and growth i think the world congress will help to demonstrate that nothing is impossible
5932012 we wish to be just as much a part of the congress as our parents and carers
5932013 higher than the question of our duration is the question of our deserving
5932014 i think i got my peaking right im just not as strong as these guys and this is the olympics these are the best sprinters in the world and like 20 25 making the final we havent seen that before
5932015 yeah i expected the other three to qualify and the last place to be between me
5932016 ive hammered christian during the year but he ran a great bend and hes just got better with every race i think his injury troubles are finally behind him hes finding his groove again for the first time in years
5932017 hes found it just at the wrong time for me
5932018 ive clearly improved and come on another level this has probably come a year too early but it was a good championship for me
5932019 i knew 20 25 would probably make it and it did from both heats but i just didnt have that extra gear and i was moving up a class again
5932020 generally i think i was just a touch down most of the race it was just a tiny tiny fraction but i was fifth off the bend where id hoped to be fourth maybe and then tightened up
5932021 i had a great time out there i said id enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt come around very often theres 91 000 people there but you dont really see them until you finish
5932022 yeah i suppose so because how close can you be one place but i couldnt do any more ive improved and improved this year i ran 20 3 twice here and maybe next time i can run 20 2 twice
5932023 ive tried so hard and havent made it but im the number two european here a metre off the final against the best jamaicans and americans so i cant be too disappointed
5932024 i havent messed up ive just been a metre short
5932025 we have enough offensive players already like robbie like doyle like duff like mcgeady hunt and keogh
5932026 its up there with the strongest weve had in my time its certainly as strong as it has been in the past five years you look around the squad and theres a lot of quality a lot of players in the premier league which is great
5932027 i think we have a good chance of making it to the world cup yes its a tough group but we have a chance as much as everyone else
5932028 it just hasnt been good enough its as simple as that
5932029 as players you have to take responsibility both as an individual and as a team its a team game and we have to look after each other if we dont do that then we havent got a chance
5932030 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
5932031 this is not perfect legislation the first step is what we have before us today so that we maintain important provisions in our gun registration law while we continue to look at how we can further refine our gun registration law
5932032 the handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement as applied to self defense violate the second amendment similarly the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional
5932033 the weak position of the federal budget became the main reason of the black august in 1998 in the summer of 1998 the finance ministry could fund only a half of its spending with the help of taxes the other half was funded at the expense of borrowings when markets stopped lending money to the ministry the federal budget was unable to function properly
5932034 i was very surprised to hear yesterdays statement from finance minister kudrin who did not say a word about the budgetary policy and the weakness of russia s budget during the period of the crisis moreover i was surprised to hear mr kudrin laying the blame for the crisis on the imf if the minister said what he really thouhgt then it means that our government had not learned any lesson from the events that happened ten years ago
5932035 you have a style of writing i just cant do
5932036 my book is a respectful portrayal of islam of aisha of muhammad and anyone who reads it with an open mind will come away with an understanding of islam as a peaceful religion
5932037 we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions
5932038 im going to tell you there are no terrorist threats against random house there was never received any terrorist threat
5932039 by saying that muslims will be violent that they cant intelligently discuss this book its disrespectful to muslims
5932040 to me it feels racist for them to say that someone will try to attack them that someone will try to go after me
5932041 this is one of the most despicable episodes of appeasement
5932042 you can intimidate publishing and media to not publish anything critical about islam and just by an indirect threat of not being happy about it
5932043 my husband knows me but yet buys me things i dont like
5932044 i love you but seriously dont buy me anything from the target dollar bins for our wedding anniversary
5932045 you have a style of writing i just cant do

5932050 two other applications have been suspended due to incomplete procedures
5932051 in one case the applicant wanted to involve children in the demonstration
5932052 im sure well get to the bottom of exactly what happened
5932053 when we didnt show up as requested in this fax no one called us to ask where we were or we would have sent a unit down immediately to cover the event
5932054 instead well into the event the injury of the girl happened and we were then called and responded in 10 minutes
5932055 brand new dungeons and an arena mode that add exciting new dimensions
5932056 this study challenges the use of ice water immersion in athletes
5932057 ice water immersion offers no benefit for pain swelling isometric strength and function and in fact may make more athletes sore the next day
5932058 i dont find it hard to believe that the ice doesnt have any long term benefit although i would question whether the ice group really did feel more pain after 24 hours than the tepid group the problem with pain is that it is subjective and very hard to measure
5932059 thats not really what i think it is is it
5932060 keeping tires properly inflated if motorists kept their tires properly inflated total savings in 2013 could be as much as 200 000 barrels of oil per day this would have the added benefits of longer tire life and improved safety
5932061 just came across this same discussion on the apple discussion forums and as someone has pointed out you can enable the birthday calendar in the
5932062 the reality is that today the mac platform is relatively safe there are hundreds of thousands of viruses and other malicious software programs floating around for windows but less than 200 are known to target the mac and many of those are aimed at versions of the mac os prior to mac os x and thus have no effect on a modern mac its not that mac os x is inherently more secure against viruses than current versions of windows although it was clearly more secure than windows prior to xp sp2 the numerous vulnerabilities reported and patched in recent years are just as exploitable as their windows equivalents but most security experts agree that malicious software these days is driven by financial incentives and its far more profitable to target the most dominant platform
5932063 is there a master page with all the error codes and their equivalents in english if not would you please make one
5932064 i just dont know how you can consider toll equity without having i 93 tolls on the table

5932098 this is an exciting opportunity for all of us at instranet and will be a huge leap forward for the saas market
5932099 this acquisition gives salesforce crm customer service amp support unique technology that provides a better approach to knowledge base management
5932100 and the timing is ripe companies have been asking for a better way to organize their corporate knowledge to serve customers and this acquisition will help salesforce com differentiate itself from the competition
5932101 worldwide customer service applications 2008 vendor shares economic uncertainty will drive service applications
5932102 salesforce crm customer service amp support has already revolutionized our support centers by bringing the benefits of saas to our support personnel around the globe

5932104 this technology has had a significant impact on our ability to rapidly launch new clients and maximize our agents efficiency our 7 000 customer service representatives use the solution on a daily basis and i see further growth potential
5932105 instranet discovered how to filter out the noise created by the explosion of information that customers and agents must navigate the combination of instranets technology and salesforce crm makes a lot of sense
5932106 but weve been robbed three times and the route of access was on the rails
5932107 weve been told that the rails and ties are unusable
5932108 its one of those wonderful backyard issues that i want
5932109 you have in my opinion pushed the fringe with this one
5932110 at least five of these are the greatest of all time in their own right and their own time
5932111 there are so many events in swimming unlike track where you can only be a sprinter or a middle distance runner
5932112 there have been a lot of outstanding performances in the olympics
5932113 its just like when i talk about my accomplishments playing football in high school
5932114 he can be called michael the best olympian of all time
5932115 moreso not because of the fact that hes got more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and the way hes actually won
5932116 800 millones superior a la estimaci n de standard and poors
5932117 for someone either as a member of the community thats aggrieved or someone thats not even a member of the community to insert themselves into the process and stand in the way of the process that this community has decided for itself is shocking
5932118 were trying to work together with everybody in town to work out something thats in everybodys best interest
5932119 i certainly dont want the project westwood station to fail and i dont believe it will at least not for this reason
5932120 rick is a valuable member of the community the sooner we can get this resolved the better it will be for everybody
5932121 were no longer a dry town now thats the bottom line
5932122 coming up soon there will be not only one license but in the spring i guarantee you the town will be asking for at least a few more off premise retail licenses catered toward grocery stores and not small mom and pop liquor stores
5932123 we have a lot of bridges to cross before we have other license to give out
5932124 were something dramatic like that chapter 138 given to the town as a possibility i would strongly suggest that we would go to town meeting and get some feedback thats a big change from where we were at the last town meeting
5932125 its nice especially considering where our team is in the race
5932126 the guys helped me with great defense and our hitting has been good too
5932127 it wasnt a mistake he hits the ball good off me all the time
5932128 our aim in the fca is to issue a unified executive list that is binding for the entire uae
5932129 we have discussed this with the saudi authorities it appears that in one of the past few years the total value of goods that entered saudi arabia was sr11 billion dh10 7bn including goods worth sr300 million from the uae
5932130 even if we assume that 50 per cent of uae goods were fake which is impossible they will not exceed 1 5 per cent of the total commodities entering into saudi arabia and this percentage is much less than the globally accepted 10 per cent
5932131 and who he was going to vote for in the election
5932132 we tightened up our frontline defense after that first game and it allowed us to set the tempo
5932133 so we still are young and we make mistakes but were starting to play better as a team
5932134 desert skys commitment to xcor is an important vote of confidence in the company
5932135 institutional investors tend to be cautious and deliberate when selecting investments because they are investing other peoples money and must be able to justify their decisions to their limited partners this is why they bring a heightened level of due diligence and professionalism to their investment decisions this investment by desert sky holdings indicates that institutional investors are starting to appreciate xcors value proposition and its prospects in an industry that has not traditionally attracted significant interest of course neither did netscape or youtube when they first started out
5932136 the managing partners at desert sky holdings have long been interested in the space sector so we have kept an eye out for opportunities in this revolutionary industry
5932137 after extensive due diligence we believe we have found an industry leader xcor has a superior management team that is executing a plan that should lead to successful space flight as well as stellar returns for our investors
5932138 je kan iemand wel horen spreken maar daarom versta je die persoon niet altijd er is dus een groot verschil tussen horen en verstaan traditionele testen beoordelen enkel het horen biepjes maar houden geen rekening met het spraakverstaan deze nieuwe vorm van testen geeft dus een veel nauwkeuriger beeld over hoe iemand in de praktijk conversaties kan verstaan
5932139 iemand die niet goed hoort en verstaat zal zich meer isoleren en gaat minder contacten opzoeken dit betekent niet alleen minder mobiliteit maar ook mentaal minder bezig zijn
5932140 no it cant be theyre going to do away with some minor character at the edge of the frame
5932141 effectively officials can gain access to the stricken vessel for only about one hour at a time on the low tides at the beginning and end of the day
5932142 but this is an extremely difficult task in the circumstances
5932143 als je hoopt op een beter amerika dan heb ik uw boot nodig
5932144 we were on cell phones and as soon as we reached 2 861 we targeted a fan at gate h
5932145 the 50 000 is great and getting the two season tickets is amazing
5932146 my buddy bought my ticket i was going to switch tickets with him in line
5932147 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5932148 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5932149 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
5932150 well at least it wasnt five runs so we at least had a chance to come back
5932151 were going to see these guys the rest of the week so weve seen almost everyone theyve got hopefully weve learned something
5932152 i dont think even at 21 kids have the maturity to make the right decisions let alone under the influence
5932153 im actually an orientation leader on campus and the first question freshmen always ask is where are all the parties its frustrating because you cant say enough to them about party but party in moderation
5932154 for me i think it would be a good idea
5932155 before i was 21 i was kind of irresponsible about it i think if we lowered the drinking age there would be less accidents
5932156 if you lower it to 18 most kids are in high school then
5932157 i think if people start drinking at 18 theyre more responsible once they get older
5932158 i think what these college presidents are recommending is just bad public policy
5932159 the minimum drinking age is one of the most studied and proven public health measures ever taken i really dont understand why they feel the need to revisit what basically was a failed experiment
5932160 i think we can agree that underage drinking is a problem on college campuses
5932161 what we need to do is find a reasonable solution to the problem rather than rolling back 25 years of progress to me that doesnt make a whole lot of sense
5932162 we dont have a crisis on our hands with alcohol here
5932163 i think we would favor a lower legal age of consumption
5932164 while we dont have any details of this proposal we are inclined to give it favorable consideration should it move forward
5932165 but we have not studied it as an institution yet
5932166 some of us not all of us were in the field when it was lower and remember it just felt easier to manage and was safer
5932167 everybody was standing there or dancing there right in front of you
5932168 were doing well given that the american market was poor last night but the commodities market was very positive and i think thats why bhp and rio are doing so well today mr heffernan said
5932169 the banks are a bit wishy washy but theyre not doing too bad
5932170 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
5932171 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
5932172 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
5932173 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
5932174 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
5932175 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy
5932176 these are some of the best practices going on around the country
5932177 working with many of our large customers to consolidate orders
5932178 we have lived in this neighborhood for 2 years we dont know any of our neighbors and that is totally sad because basically we rock and they need to know us so an ice cream party would be a good excuse to get everyone together and allow them to bask in our pure awesomeness
5932179 one of us is here almost all the time and we make a point to have one of us in the dining room so were visible i think its still a novelty for customers to come into a restaurant and actually see the owner greeting you and working in the dining room
5932180 theres no reason when the owner is there that you should ever leave the restaurant dissatisfied
5932181 plus were consistent we have almost no employee turnover and all of our key employees have been here for 10 or more years that leads to consistency of service
5932182 i did very well athletically at northeastern but not so well academically
5932183 but ray did and he taught me how to make them
5932184 unfortunately after i bought him out he opened another doughnut shop around the corner and took the business with him so i was left here with a doughnut shop and no business i spent the next three years cultivating a business during the night i made the doughnuts and during the day i cultivated the business by spending a lot of time with the public
5932185 we used to have a lot of guys come in from the department including a guy named romeo defazio
5932186 he used to say to me why dont you sell breakfast and i said i would but i dont know how to cook eggs so he came in one day with a dozen eggs and a pound of bacon and showed me how to cook eggs
5932187 after romeo taught me how to make eggs i woke up one morning and said you know im making doughnuts im working nights im killing myself i make more money on an order of eggs than a dozen doughnuts maybe i should sell eggs so i started to sell eggs and that took off eventually the eggs won out
5932188 when we made blts the mailman used to come in for lunch and he wanted something light so he said instead of making a blt why dont you take a little bit of that lettuce tomato and bacon and make a salad so we said ok and we made a little salad
5932189 the other customers saw the mailman eating the salad and said lets have a salad like the mailman eventually it became known as the mailman salad and its still on the menu though now it has different variations
5932190 when i started to sell food i opened up part of the back where we made the doughnuts i needed some tables and chairs there was a laundromat down the street that went out of business and it had tables where people folded their laundry i got those tables and put them in the back of the restaurant and thats where the people sat when they came in for lunch
5932191 he knew how to fry clams and french fries and he talked me into putting in a fryolator
5932192 so now we had french fries and on fridays we would run a special with fried clams then we started to build a lunch business
5932193 we continued to grow and eventually stopped making doughnuts and got serious about breakfast and lunch then i decided to try to open nights too on friday and saturday nights wed be open until 1 or 2 a m to get the movie crowd but we found after awhile that wasnt profitable and we stopped that we did stay open nights during the week but we were really struggling to make ends meet
5932194 i hired him for a month to come in and analyze my business and teach me how to do food buying and train my employees
5932195 i hired the student to analyze my business too i wish i could remember her name she did a complete hour by hour study and told me i was making money up until 2 30 p m from 2 30 to 9 p m i was losing money so a month later i started closing nights and staying open until 2 30 p m i had been behind in my bills 90 days in three months time i was current with all my bills it was really an eye opening experience and thats how we survived in those days
5932196 another reason i used to play tennis on friday afternoon at the natick racquet club with a bunch of guys but we had no place to eat after tennis so i stayed open so the guys could come here and eat
5932197 once dunkin donuts got popular we couldnt compete with them
5932198 besides people werent coming here for doughnuts they were coming here for bacon and eggs
5932199 we demolished the whole place and were closed for two months
5932200 i think we saved one piece of equipment at the time we were 30 years old and the place looked tired and nothing worked the air conditioning didnt work the dishwasher didnt work water was dripping from the ceiling the booths were torn and ripped yet the day before we closed was probably one of the busiest days we ever had and the place was falling apart and we were closing for two months i said what the hell are we doing but it had to be done
5932201 there was a hail and rainstorm in the middle of winter and the place was still jammed
5932202 the customers came in and just sat at the counter it was unbelievable
5932203 we take breakfast to the next level with very creative items
5932204 wayland became a more upscale community and we grew with it
5932205 rather than stay what we were we listened to our customers and tried to give them what they wanted
5932206 we cook to order we cook fresh chain comes out with sandwiches that are all pre made and put into a microwave oven
5932207 theres a girl i went to school with who just came in with her grandchildren
5932208 we had 50th birthday parties here and when we turned 65 we had a medicare party this place is so special because mel is one of the nicest guys we know
5932209 a community drop in center first come the day workers then the white shirt guys then the tennis women then the seniors its a wonderful melange weve met people here we wouldnt have known otherwise the food also happens to be very good
5932210 in the early days every once and awhile mel let me flip the doughnuts with a wooden stick so i felt special
5932211 ive eaten more breakfasts here than i have anywhere else in my life
5932212 i was here on a sunday morning and im cruising around the tables and checking out people seeing who i know
5932213 im walking through the restaurant and this woman calls me over to her table
5932214 the threat were facing is much more significant than what weve seen all across the state
5932215 we are going to take seriously the notion of a category 1 storm hitting early thursday with most of the intensity being experienced in the day
5932216 in 2004 during the hurricane season we experienced power outages up to 9 days we think its smart to have the necessary supplies water batteries non perishable foods should we have significant power outages for a period of time
5932217 we think the best strategy at this point is for people in low lying areas that have experienced flooding historically they should consider relocating
5932218 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
5932219 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
5932220 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
5932221 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost

5932238 its a pretty bad cork and its right in his buttock running into his hamstring and his hamstring was sore anyway so its sort of linked to that
5932239 in the last game he played he complained of a sore hamstring and then got the cork so its a bit of both
5932240 the fedora infrastructure team is currently investigating an issue in the infrastructure systems
5932241 that process may result in service outages for which we apologize in advance were still assessing the end user impact of the situation but as a precaution we recommend you not download or update any additional packages on your fedora systems
5932242 we know the community is awaiting more detail on the past weeks activities and their causes were preparing a timeline and details and will make them available in the near future we appreciate the communitys patience and will continue to post updates to the fedora announce list as soon as possible
5932243 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5932244 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5932245 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5932246 i do not understand why russia is occupying a large part of georgia i do not understand why they are destroying things there looting why they are creating forest fires by dropping flares from the sky
5932247 its mr saakashvili telling nato countries what they should do so he can meet his ambitions
5932248 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5932249 the incident shows the need for roadblocks that we set up in line with existing agreements

5932273 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5932274 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5932275 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5932276 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
5932277 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace

5932304 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5932305 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5932306 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5932307 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5932308 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5932309 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
5932310 theyre the thickest and gooiest of liquids and the most disordered and structureless of rigid solids
5932311 they sit right at this really profound sort of puzzle
5932312 in the first months of an obama administration progressives should be pursuing an inside outside strategy in relation to the administration for example in the transition we should push to place allies in strategic positions particularly in the areas of economic policy and national security progressives will enjoy their greatest strength mobilizing independently to support obamas promises

5932314 with an absolute minimum of democratic process the us committed its full prestige to the defense of ukraine and georgia even though the russians have repeatedly stated that they regard nato membership by either country as a direct threat

5932319 terwijl het een tiental jaar geleden beperkt bleef tot enkelingen die hun humaniorawereld transponeerden en installeerden binnen de politiescholen
5932320 moeten we spijtig genoeg vaststellen dat de enkelingen van destijds nu jonge dertigers zijn geworden die in hun kielzog heel wat navolging hebben gekregen voor zover geweten beperkt het zich hoofdzakelijk nog tot de politiekorpsen binnen de grootsteden omwille van het feit dat die korpsen de grootste afnemers zijn van jonge afgestudeerde politieagenten
5932321 e p a s about face means that some permit programs do not comply
5932322 i think it is fair to say that the d c circuit has repudiated the vast bulk of the bush administrations clean air regulatory reforms which were the administrations most notable and significant if not always wise environmental policy initiatives
5932323 was giving business a bit of a break was saying to states you cant do more
5932324 one of the ways states experiment is not only being more protective but being more protective more cheaply they win if they figure out a way to make environmental controls less costly
5932325 the idea was to make this information accessible to public and to state governments
5932326 even though the e p a admitted that existing monitoring wasnt good enough

5932333 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5932334 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5932335 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5932336 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5932337 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property
5932338 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5932339 we have the highest traded currency in the world as a percentage of gdp so it is not surprising our exchange rate fluctuations are so severe
5932340 what we have seen is investments focusing on short term returns while longer term opportunities move offshore or are never attempted the products and services produced by our economy simplify causing earnings per capita fall and a further decline down the international wealth tables
5932341 well so is this youve got some explaining to do
5932342 ok thatll be 10 99 please pull up to the first window
5932343 weve done a lot of work over the past 18 months
5932344 clearly customers have embraced this agreement and given us strong feedback and completely support the approach weve taken
5932345 they just wanted microsoft and novell to provide what we call a covenant not to sue
5932346 we have the highest traded currency in the world as a percentage of gdp so it is not surprising our exchange rate fluctuations are so severe
5932347 these rapid currency fluctuations make it difficult for those involved in the tradeable sector to make secure long term investments 2 margins are increasing at the moment but the same forces that have crunched credit availability are slowing demand across global markets high margins and low sales might be as bad as high sales and low margins it may be hard to capitalise on a fair value currency even as things improve for our exporters future investment will be tainted by past experiences
5932348 what we have seen is investments focusing on short term returns while longer term opportunities move offshore or are never attempted the products and services produced by our economy simplify causing earnings per capita fall and a further decline down the international wealth tables
5932349 unless we see some changes to monetary policy including a move away from a singular focus on inflation we will continue to go round the economic cycle losing more of our real economy each time ultimately we all depend on the success of our tradable sector to develop and grow our exporters and manufacturers need more stability
5932350 i didnt mean anything negatively or maliciously but from my point of view heres a guy whos been in the system four years and hes in a quarterback battle
5932351 you just thought things would look a little differently i think that performance said something i dont know if my criticism was that harsh except i just expected him to play better especially when youve been around as long as he has and youre in a battle for your job
5932352 watching matt sunday night hearing all the criticism i dont even know where that was coming from
5932353 that was so far from what i was watching the quarterback has a lot of responsibility out there i thought matt was making good decisions he was really decisive with his throws was every throw perfect no but that doesnt happen so often anyway
5932354 i see matt every day in practice and the improvement he makes i love what i see in matt i have a lot of confidence in matt for the three guys sitting in the booth i thought it was unfair to criticize the way they were criticizing because i dont think they really knew what was happening
5932355 im not going to disagree with toms assessment of matt cassel i cant im not there every day
5932356 but i would still say my criticism of matt cassel in that football game was based on the offense not having any shape or form im putting all that on him im not looking at the offensive line being out im not looking at the running backs im just looking at a guy whos in a quarterback battle and looks this dull from where we were in the booth that was an opportunity for him to distance himself a little bit and he didnt
5932357 a lot of those guys are ex players and they understand how difficult this game is and how hard you prepare week in and week out and so when theyre so critical its interesting to me because those guys were in the same shoes at one point in their career and they should understand how hard it is to go out there and perform each and every week
5932358 my criticisms were based on the fact the offense hasnt flowed in the two preseason games matt has been in and based on the injuries theres a chance if tom were to go down theres a chance matts going to be the quarterback and i think all of us watching are curious to see what that offense would look like without tom
5932359 sure he had a few drops in there but when the offense struggles like that i gave a lot of the criticism to matt

5932366 i pastor a multimillion dollar congregation youve got to put me on a different scale than the little black preacher sitting over there thats supposed to be just getting by because the people are suffering
5932367 when i hear about leaders of charities being provided a 300 000 bentley to drive around in my fear is that its the taxpayers who subsidize this charity who are really being taken for a ride
5932368 with toms situation i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before
5932369 its just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5932370 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it we just have to balance that off when that happens
5932371 i think that really all of them have plenty of work to do themselves and plenty of things they need to work on
5932372 there is always a timing element with the quarterback and the receiver but that goes both ways we have had receivers not be out there quarterback not be out there tight ends running backs or whatever it is most importantly i think for each player at this point in training camp to do what they can do
5932373 you still have to play football whether hes in there or not
5932374 theres a lot of things we didnt do well and not because tom wasnt playing its not like if tom was playing i wouldnt have fumbled the ball theres a lot of little things we have to do better as an offense
5932375 we just felt like with marcus that it really wasnt going to work out here the way that we had hoped and that he had hoped
5932376 but at the same time there is still a couple of preseason games left there is some time before the opener and i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
5932377 but the schools were involved to purposely facilitate evangelism school officials know full well that some children have never had their own bible it is not the public school systems place to fill in where the church has failed
5932378 it takes a special type of person to complain about what they get for free
5932379 the pressure is going to be much greater from now on
5932380 my opinion is that he should have just stayed with the senior team but he preferred to have this experience
5932381 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5932382 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game

5932394 i dont know i dont read the papers and i dont listen to any of that stuff because it doesnt matter to me what people say on the outside all that matters is whats going on internally and how im doing and how im preparing and how im getting this week
5932395 a lot of those guys are ex players and they understand how difficult this game is and how hard you prepare week in and week out
5932396 we go out there and we work to put 100 percent effort out there
5932397 and we go to put a great performance out there every week so thats just how it goes and some people are going to be like that

5932401 a direct flight out of bangalore to london has good potential what mallya can now do is feed traffic from other southern states into bangalore to fly directly to london instead of passengers going to mumbai or delhi
5932402 if mallya starts daily flights from bangalore to london it will double the capacity on the sector this means that ba will have to share its market with kingfisher

5932420 its too little to start with but we need to open the door to get the military monitors in there because someone needs to observe this ceasefire

5932428 i think ebay does care and this is their way of showing it
5932429 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump

5932437 this displacement is compounding the health problems in the region raising the risk of communicable diseases
5932438 of course there was a great symbolism to them doing this at the senaki base
5932439 in their eyes senaki was a bit of nato that they just dont want to see in georgia
5932440 the buildings the arms all gone if you consider that this is one of the few such modern bases we have this was very important for us

5932453 contrary to published reports those impacted were distributed across our organization rather than focused on a single department also contrary to published reports the layoffs were unrelated to any ongoing discussions to divest a portion of our business that claim is irresponsible journalism and outright false
5932454 we never had such an agreement all we said in march was we were cooperating with bittorrent on doing tests on how we deliver peer to peer content on our network and to find out if there was a more efficient way to deliver those bits given that p2p hasnt always been as efficient running over networks as it could be
5932455 with respect to bittorrent the fcc announcement is about our managing our network by delaying a certain number of peer to peer file transfers were moving to a protocol agnostic network management so all protocols will be treated equally our march agreement with bittorrent continues
5932456 it does hurt them and they are still competing with what is largely a traditional distribution market cable satellite or dsl and we still live in a world of good enough if i can get through a set top box get most of what i want why set up a bittorrent hub

5932460 i could segue into some political rant here a slick dismissal of the bush administration perhaps or a paragraph declaring my support for barack obama but the moment i walked into the soup kitchen the moment i acknowledged publicly that i could not provide food for myself or my children which is why the soup kitchen is so much more difficult than the food bank is the moment that my ability to believe in the politics of this country was forever altered i know why poor people have historically low voter turnout rates if you vote you acknowledge that you believe in the system and to believe in the system when youre at the very bottom when youve watched the chrome and ink black suvs drive by while youre packing your own beater with dried beans and lentils to believe at that point is fucking painful you either say the system works and youve earned your place or you concede that there is something wrong and there might not be any way to fix it

5932504 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5932505 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5932506 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5932507 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5932508 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5932509 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5932510 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5932511 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5932512 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5932513 those two guys have kicked a lot of goals each they are the real two key focal points for them
5932514 we have got young defenders that will have those big challenges
5932515 its looking at what eric mackenzie and beau wilkes have shown over the last few weeks and theyve taken up some big challenges and performed very well
5932516 its a pretty bad cork and its right in his buttock running into his hamstring and his hamstring was sore anyway so its sort of linked to that
5932517 in the last game he played he complained of a sore hamstring and then got the cork so its a bit of both
5932518 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
5932519 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
5932520 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
5932521 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
5932522 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5932523 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5932524 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5932525 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
5932526 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
5932527 bargain hunters have returned to the market on talks that a rescue package is on the way
5932528 shanghai has proven to be a very emotional market and is likely to stay that way
5932529 it is too early for a fiscal stimulus package and we should be responsible about calling for one
5932530 there is still room for monetary policy before we try fiscal policy
5932531 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5932532 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence if he chooses to take up residence somewhere we would obviously look at it
5932533 my resignation as president does not reflect my defeat as i resigned in the interest of pakistan and its people
5932534 how can i make myself read this if i dont even like the pictures
5932535 maintenance practices for the clearing of vegetation at the murrow farm level crossing were inadequate to maintain effective sighting of trains
5932536 programmed works that had identified the vegetation as a sighting hazard which was to be rectified within 28 days had not been carried out in accordance with the relevant maintenance specification
5932537 i am very pleased that my colleagues in the assembly are joining forces with me and statewide environmental organizations to better protect california and the environment from pollution
5932538 this is a huge victory for the residents of santa barbara county the environment and all californians
5932539 companies operating internationally are discovering that their transfer pricing positions may face challenges from one tax authority even when that position is well supported and accepted by other tax authorities operating under the umbrella of the oecd guidelines
5932540 at a time when california faces significant and ongoing water supply challenges this legislation allows us to go further in improving and expanding water conservation across the state by expanding the opportunity not the mandate for urban water suppliers to encourage water conservation through their water rate structures
5932541 i m pleased that both houses of the state legislature approved this bill and encourage the governor to sign it into law and enable water suppliers throughout the state to use this effective conservation tools shown to achieve dramatic water savings without significant taxpayer investment
5932542 working at the intersection of the business cultural and philanthropy sectors bringing design thinking and design processes to a host of social and environmental challenges
5932543 is there a definitive canadian style in our graphic design
5932544 the uk has a comprehensive network of bilateral double taxation conventions and we are committed to maintaining and strengthening this network these agreements help uk business and investors to remain competitive by providing them with a measure of certainty and stability in their tax affairs
5932545 the lack of transparency in this formal procedure weakens the system and consequently creates uncertainty among the general public and members of the legal community that endangers legitimacy and breeds a lack of confidence in the process
5932546 among our goal of assessing leading candidates for merit to the judiciary which includes professional capacity personal characteristics there should also be diversity to the extent that the court s composition adequately reflects the diversity of california s population
5932547 given our challenge regarding egregious disparity in california s sentencing laws it is imperative to consider diverse backgrounds when determining who should judge accused citizens
5932548 this bill increases fairness in deciding who is qualified for judgeship
5932549 california currently is among the most lenient of states regarding extreme drunk drivers
5932550 my measure would reduce the blood alcohol threshold from 20 to 15 this decreases the threshold for judges requiring vehicle breathalyzers as punishment for drunken driving
5932551 they are flagrantly endangering themselves and everyone they encounter on the road
5932552 this funding will help boost our local economy and create new opportunities for residents throughout the moreno valley area
5932553 i am pleased to have supported these funds that will give the city the resources and flexibility it needs to help individuals and families throughout our community this is an investment that will spark growth and development in our region which is especially important during this tough economic time
5932554 this funding helps communities build better neighborhoods from the ground up
5932555 whether it s improving infrastructure or producing more homes families can afford hud grants have the potential to breathe new life into communities and make them better places to live and work
5932556 moreno valley is committed to using cdbg and other funding from hud in the most cost effective manner possible to have the greatest benefit at improving the livability of the community
5932557 moreno valley is a dynamic and diverse city and our many different cdbg programs reflect that diversity
5932558 the federal government has just admitted that these three deadly poisons are washing off into our rivers and streams and harming west coast salmon runs and who knows what else
5932559 the government says these poisons are increasing the risk of salmon extinction substantially we need to find alternatives and act quickly to prevent these chemicals from reaching west coast rivers and streams
5932560 we got into this mess because the bush administrations epa refuses to take seriously the harm that pesticides pose to salmon the biologists at the national fisheries management service have now confirmed that epa failed to acknowledge the true danger posed by these poisons earlier this week the bush administration announced a set of proposed rules that would cut these all federal wildlife experts out of similar future decisions they must think no one is noticing
5932561 you should not be able to plead no contest to a sex offense just so you can continue teaching
5932562 if you are innocent you plead innocent and you show the court why you are innocent it is inexcusable to be able to exploit a loophole and jeopardize our children so one can continue teaching
5932563 why a group who represents teachers would want a sex offender teaching in the classroom is beyond me
5932564 the aclu is one thing but for a teachers union to oppose a measure designed to make our schools safer is just plain baffling
5932565 in an era of constant partisanship and bickering it is inspiring to see my colleagues join together to vote for a measure which ensures all holders of teaching credentials charged with sex or controlled substance offenses are dealt with appropriately
5932566 unfortunately in many jurisdictions there are as many illegal taxicabs as legal ones
5932567 taking away their phone number rightfully ends the source of much of their business illegal taxicab operations deprive our local communities of revenue disadvantage legal operators and because they often do not go through the proper inspections safety requirements drug testing or carry appropriate accident coverage policies they are a threat to public safety
5932568 pharmacies should be places where people go to get better not where people go to get cancer
5932569 this law is by no means a panacea but if it stops one person from smoking then it is worth the effort
5932570 the state has empowered them with the ability to tax and to make and enforce laws that affect the day to day lives and the pocket books of homeowners
5932571 that s a lot of power over people s lives and property
5932572 that s not always an attractive or even a financially feasible option for many homeowners especially seniors on limited incomes
5932573 removing bureaucratic barriers to family communication is an efficient and effective means of helping rehabilitate incarcerated youth and will greatly cut recidivism rates
5932574 the research is clear the youth and the general public are better off when we allow for greater communication with families i urge the governor to sign this commonsense bill into law
5932575 current policies are inconsistent and counter productive to rehabilitating children and ultimately protecting the community
5932576 sb 1250 will establish a consistent protocol for family communication and help keep families connected when their children need them most this bill is a crucial element for successful rehabilitation and an investment worth making for healthier families and safer streets
5932577 currently families are not only cut off by barriers to communication but shut out when their involvement is most crucial such as when their children attempt suicide or have a parole hearing to determine if theyre ready for release we applaud senator yees leadership in introducing a package of reforms that will enable and enhance communication for families whose loved ones are locked away in isolated warehouse youth prisons
5932578 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5932579 el aporte hecho por parte de russoro mining es hecla mina choco 10 mientras que el aporte hecho por el gobierno es la mina la camorra
5932580 a diferencia de la planta utilizada por hecla de 700 toneladas nos permite ampliar los horizontes en el potencial minero al sur del estado bol var queremos plantearle al gobierno la explotaci n de yacimiento de bajos tenores de manera mancomunada con la intenci n de optimizar los recursos aur feros en la zona de el callao el mineral explotable en la mina isidora en condiciones actuales es de dos a os sin embargo con la explotaci n de menores tenores y con la exploraci n necesaria el objetivo es aumentar la mina a 20 a os de explotaci n con una capacidad de 600 toneladas por d a
5932581 lo que sucedi fue que esta empresa le compr las acciones a gold fields nosotros vamos a hacer una evaluaci n de esa situaci n porque las minas no las acciones son propiedad de los venezolanos administradas por el estado
5932582 i couldnt base something that was so auspicious and beautiful of that moment and take away the surprise for home d cor
5932583 gets a lot of guitar i think it likes it
5932584 omg i would never find out the sex of my baby just so i could decorate the room how could minnie say that
5932585 i feel a baby is gift and when that gift is ready to be opened you get to find out the surprise
5932586 and any everyone that chooses differently is wrong wrong wrong
5932587 no i just know its a boy i dont need that
5932588 i guess youll be buying lots of green and yellow
5932589 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
5932590 now we just need to get the legislature to put a funding package together
5932591 it costs a lot more to put a vehicle on the road with an operator and everything else that goes into it than people really think about on a daily basis
5932592 just when it comes to our current buildings or park and ride its costing more nowadays
5932593 nobody has any money its sad but hopefully we can all keep doing things like riding light rail since it saves more energy
5932594 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
5932595 although the meeting was not terribly well attended we did get to meet some residents and hear from them what issues they have
5932596 the main concerns that we heard about were people receiving a slow response from police little or no discretion being used for minor traffic violations and the need for more police in west bay
5932597 this campaign was designed to focus heavily on the areas and the people known to be involved in crime or criminal activity we carried out pre planned operations high visibility foot patrols and roadblocks all of which were intended to disrupt criminal activity and put pressure on those committing crime
5932598 1 000 plus a 2008 lexus is a dream come true for many customers this is another way that the bigger better network is saying thank you to its valuable customers
5932599 this is no different for any other witnesses appearing before the court if theyre abroad then their expenses are paid
5932600 were more than sure that the pi wont be concluded on thursday because of the amount of evidence thats got to be given
5932601 it is for the courts to decide whether or not its a strong case but theres certainly enough evidence that the attorney generals office has let it go this far and the chief magistrate will decide whether there is enough evidence for the grand court
5932602 this is the official david hasselhoff social network lets socialize
5932603 i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me
5932604 the course was very intense and a lot was expected of us in order to pass our tests
5932605 the instructors were very professional and made me feel confident about the course
5932606 we have officially listed the former president his wife wu shu chen brother in law wu ching mao his son chen chih chung and daughter in law huang jui ching as defendants over the case
5932607 very often the only remedy to alleviate pain is to extract the teeth but on this trip they managed some preventative treatment as well
5932608 most patients were children under 14 and when they were done they treated the adults some of whom had suffered toothache for years
5932609 youngsters line up for treatment and there is no such thing as a missed appointment they will often shun anaesthetics because they have become used to the pain and are not used to the needle and the numbness it creates
5932610 cita looks forward to future endeavours of this nature that align with our cruise sector goals and our general association objective to provide more opportunity for converting cruise passengers are into return overnight visitors
5932611 we recognize that cruise and stay over are both major pillars of the cayman islands tourism industry
5932612 although i really enjoy visiting i would not want to live there its true that the country has changed a great deal since my family left and in many ways things are much better but it is still a hard place to live especially compared to countries in the west opportunities there are getting better but they are still limited
5932613 there is an international community there including lots of ukrainians and jamaicans and chinese and iranians
5932614 some say im russian and a few guess ukrainian but others say spanish or even italian some ukrainians are fair haired and blue eyed and so look typically russian but other ukrainians are not like that at all so its not easy to guess
5932615 but there are so many different nationalities here that you could probably guess for 20 minutes and still not be right for a small place this is really an international community
5932616 normally i am the last one out of the blocks and it is evident most of the time
5932617 this time i wasnt the first one out but i wasnt the last one out either so i am pretty pleased how i executed the race
5932618 the time speaks for itself it is a new personal record and a new national record it is my best effort and the time proved it
5932619 that is tremendous work and tremendous ability and he has set a personal record at his first olympics the sky is the limit for him now
5932620 he is carrying china on his back that is tremendous pressure and to compete in the same event with him is a tremendous honor
5932621 whoever gives the best effort walks away with it so i wish him all the best and i know i will try my best
5932622 hockey is not only the fastest sport on the island but also the fastest growing sport the reason is simple and that is it offers a combination of every sporting element that both kids and adults want to see speed action competitiveness fair play and most of all discipline this island is hungry for organized sports and kings is a one stop shop for just that
5932623 after a quiet and peaceful summer the intense westtel adult roller hockey league skates back into gear in september the league has seen some player changes with some of the veteran players leaving the island but a new influx of recreational players should make this season one of our best
5932624 the coveted cherry cup has been held by three of the four teams to date with the alba high rollers earning the cup back in june of this year the pressure is on elite marble and granite to seal the deal this time around after several close but incomplete seasons however keep an eye out for the chiefs and boomers as they look to take the cup home this season
5932625 one of the things that impresses me about this programme is the cheering that the parents do during the games lets really try to keep this at a high level as it only helps to get the kids motivated for the games one of these days im sure well get some moms making banners for their teams and bringing in blow horns
5932626 i think today was a look at the start of what could be a fantastic rivalry between cayman international and cayman prep and the birth of a new sport for kids of cayman as a sponsor i saw an exciting and action packed game and as a parent i was very proud of the effort of my sons team it was a great game and well coached teams
5932627 report on pre disposing factors to criminality in the cayman islands
5932628 taking ownership of the underlying issues contributing to underachievement marginalization and social deprivation of boys in particular
5932629 we have forty million reasons for failure but not a single excuse
5932630 they wont build no schools anymore all they build is prison prison prison
5932631 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5932632 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5932633 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5932634 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need
5932635 wir haben bei der suche nicht auf den taufschein geschaut sondern auf erfahrung und erfolg
5932636 ich bin sehr gl cklich wieder auf meinem posten zu sein und dort weiterzumachen wo ich 2006 aufgeh rt habe
5932637 every man yearns to be free none more so than the man in prison and at kinross prison in michigan hoffman and murphy had an idea they were gonna bust out
5932638 it comes and goes my memory the flashbacks waking up on the side of the road the blood the pain how did i get here the surgery the anger the only thing that is clear the only thing that makes sense is to get revenge try to remember find them make them pay my time will come tna will soon know me but i must remember to be patient im not ready to unleash him yet im not strong enough yet but i will be soon patience then payback
5932639 die em ist abgehakt wir wollen gewinnen ich will ein tor machen
5932640 wir sind in einer gruppe mit russland aber wir wollen die direkte qualifikation schaffen
5932641 wir m ssen die anstehenden spiele gewinnen aber parallel auch neue spieler einbauen
5932642 ich will den nahtlosen bergang zum stammspieler schaffen auch wenn es dort in frings und ballack zwei spieler gibt die noch im kader stehen
5932643 wir haben junge spieler die nachdr ngen und irgendwann kommt der punkt f r den generationswechsel
5932644 aber bis dahin haben wir ja noch ein bisschen zeit
5932645 theres no better place for this summit nevada the saudi arabia of renewable energy
5932646 dass es hier passiert ist ist nat rlich bitter aber das ist schicksal
5932647 der knackpunkt war im special das hat er nicht vergessen es ist eine schande denn er war in gro artiger form
5932648 aber so ist das leben bis dahin war es seine bisher beste k r
5932649 das kann man nicht vergleichen alles beginnt wieder bei null
5932650 jetzt wird es sehr schwer anky ist normalerweise die bessere k rreiterin
5932651 ich habe immer gesagt dass sich ein pferd auch manchmal erschrecken darf und bei satchmo war es so dass er in letzter zeit so wenig fehler gemacht hat wie kein anderes pferd aber so ist das mit ihm er ist halt auch ein genie
5932652 weve done some tweaking and returned with a program thats really broad and accessible with lots of names people will know
5932653 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
5932654 if intellectual property had a theme song it would have to be like a virgin
5932655 why because ip is all about the very first time the aha moment the creative spark that gives rise to previously undreamed imaginings
5932656 is there anything we can do for you for you are the one in trouble now
5932657 nothing bothers me more than sloth the objective is to fix mistakes of ambition and not make mistakes of sloth i work my ass off
5932658 im looking for people who have read tim ferriss 4 hour workweek to feature in a documentary for all ranges of implementation from those who have found a way to work 4 hours a week to those whove applied a few of the techniques such as outsourcing tasks to overseas assistants
5932659 so do you really just work 4 hours a week question
5932660 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5932661 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5932662 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5932663 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5932664 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5932665 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5932666 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5932667 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5932668 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5932669 i remember seeing nastia have hers from the all around and it is so pretty silver is really pretty too its the best feeling ever
5932670 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5932671 three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5932672 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5932673 i feel excellent about johnson i think she needed this so much she proved she is absolutely a great balance beam gymnast
5932674 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist is what everybody dreams of
5932675 and said can you believe that just happened i knew instantly i was going to medal
5932676 i just wanted to come out and make a statement that im back and let my teammates know
5932677 i havent played well since the first two games and ive been down on myself not contributing as much as id like
5932678 its hard to remember that she missed six weeks with that knee injury
5932679 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5932680 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5932681 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5932682 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5932683 i wouldnt say jogging im just trying to get through to the next round i didnt know if he was running i just wanted to make sure i was in good position i was looking at crawford and then i decided to look at the board to see where everybody else was
5932684 ive got nothing for you on the vp sweepstakes anything in that regard ought to be directed to the mccain campaign
5932685 i dont talk about the vp stuff because i think its mostly speculation and i just have stopped talking about it
5932686 is repeated time and time again does it mean that by u
5932687 things would be better if i wasnt here if i wasnt alive
5932688 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5932689 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in santiago from sept 19 21 in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5932690 there are definitely more accidents out there that we havent even heard about yet
5932691 the hispanic population is growing whites and asians are not replacing themselves
5932692 its the hispanic population that is keeping us above water in terms of growth in terms of births
5932693 a half century ago a woman who had a child outside of marriage was highly stigmatized
5932694 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future
5932695 i wondered why that was true and found that those second generation hispanic mothers did have higher education attainment than the third generation
5932696 it means that 25 years from now therell be many elderly people who are childless and who may not have anybody to care for them
5932697 the united states is the land of opportunity its the best country in the world and im just glad to represent it
5932698 the frustration was let out the hard work and everything
5932699 i set my goal i trained hard i had a good staff around me i just put the pieces together and i really believed in myself
5932700 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to represent the u s
5932701 not too many mexicans get the chance to do that
5932702 we always moved forward we always moved forward my mom always taught us to suck it up and whatever you want to do you can do
5932703 at the olympic trials in las vegas she couldnt take it
5932704 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment that he came from
5932705 could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that hes done an unbelievable job of not being a victim
5932706 he is the american dream gold medals are the american dream
5932707 i sat by the pool for most of it and come sunday i was thinking i would like to sit there for another week
5932708 but the fedex cup is what is attracting me out here again this week and the idea of it is to get players out to compete at this time of year after two majors you think well i could do with a rest but theres other things to play for so thats why im here this week
5932709 i did make sure i rested last week and ive got a little bit of experience now from winning these majors so i knew what to do afterwards
5932710 i believe i will be ready but im never truly able to tell until im into the tournament and i can see how i play
5932711 i remember last year i did struggle in the first couple of the fedex cup tournaments and i did end up having to pull out of a tournament because i was fatigued
5932712 this time round i feel better and stronger im motivated theres lots to play for
5932713 im looking forward to playing it the barclays is on a very nice golf course
5932714 i played 12 holes yesterday its a good old style golf course and it will be an interesting week therell be some good scoring some difficult tricky holes out there as well what you kind of expect from a tillinghast course and it looks like it will be a good tournament
5932715 this sale is an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5932716 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5932717 the airline flying to melbourne is yet another impressive aviation victory facilitated by the brumby government with more direct flights meaning more business more trade and ultimately more jobs for the victorian government
5932718 our business ties with malaysia are growing with commodity exports to malaysia up by 14 per cent since 2003 04 and service exports up by 37 per cent from 2003 04 to 2005 06 and this is yet another strong link
5932719 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
5932720 the artist is nothing without the gift but the gift is nothing without work
5932721 you can only find truth with logic if you have already found truth without it
5932722 the pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty
5932723 the strokes of the pen need deliberation as much as the sword needs swiftness
5932724 knowing that the elevators were a danger the parents had these kids get in the elevators on their own
5932725 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him
5932726 i cant wait until i get off we are having my quincea
5932727 i will have mine in four years i have already started planning
5932728 it is really exciting i cant wait too bad marta is on graveyard shift
5932729 did you bring the super glue i need to glue my barbies head back on i cant believe that jackass ramon bit it off
5932730 i cant believe that they made him a supervisor he such a corporate kiss ass i mean he thinks he is so hot in his white smock
5932731 2 onto the end of all the functions and variables
5932732 over 30 per cent of our business is in december alone and that is now in the banned season
5932733 the blow to us retailers as well as petrol boat deliverers and all knock on services is huge
5932734 those five are predominantly all caught locally so theres not much point going out
5932735 ive fought hard and driven the state government to come good on many other local projects but there are many more blatant failings that need addressing
5932736 because of these failed promises hundreds more cancer patients wont have access to local treatment and year 1 students wont see their classroom upgraded before they reach high school
5932737 wherever possible the carpenter government has been able to increase spending to build the facilities required by the community despite cost escalations created by the boom
5932738 bunbury is a sufficiently large population to be able to sustain state of the art health facilities like not only a breast assessment area but also then the follow up treatment areas for radiation therapy surgery and the like
5932739 in comparison to the money they have lavished on perth bunbury has been poorly funded
5932740 bunbury is one of the fastest growing regions in australia and this has not been recognised by the carpenter govern ment
5932741 elections are not just about future promises they are also about accountability for progress on past promises
5932742 the board has been working on a strategy to give bunbury dolphin discovery a sustainable future
5932743 we want to take it into positive community and tourism territory that hasnt been possible in the past because of funding
5932744 its important to provide the physical infrastructure so young people coming through can reach their full potential
5932745 i promised manea college on behalf of the government at the last election and there it is
5932746 when not if we get the perth to bunbury train it will be an opportunity for people to travel and get off that train only 80 minutes later
5932747 the city is looking at it as a great infill opportunity
5932748 in a way we use this to sharpen up our disciplines ahead of friday
5932749 twenty20 is very much on its own as a lottery which can go either way
5932750 we fully regard the one day series as being five matches and that starts on friday
5932751 it plays a huge role at domestic level and the injection of twenty20 has been fantastic for world cricket
5932752 perhaps domestically is where the target market for it is
5932753 internationally it is good to play a world tournament once every two years and to have a little international to almost launch your one day campaign
5932754 domestically it could be the lifeblood of the game and has a huge amount of relevance and importance there
5932755 but i dont think there should be overkill of twenty20 at international level simply because it is the lifeblood of the domestic game
5932756 overkill would take a little bit of the gloss off it so we have to watch out how much we expose it at international level
5932757 twelve months ago i was desperate to play for england the numbers six and seven places were up for grabs and i was happy to make that my own
5932758 but number three is what ive done for middlesex for eight or nine years and i know exactly what is required in that role
5932759 i feel i can do a good job at three given a reasonable run
5932760 its nice for the captain to back me to deliver a performance in a key position
5932761 a batsman like kevin pietersen is how i could challenge myself and say right thats the standard
5932762 if i do get a run and establish myself then ill be setting the sort of standards that kevin sets
5932763 and maybe one day i might be the best batter in the team i dont know time will tell
5932764 i think most batsmen have the ambition to move up the only reason for going up the order is to get the opportunity to score hundreds
5932765 i was lucky enough to get a hundred at six with the way the game went but now really delighted to get the chance to bat at three
5932766 ive been told to go and play the way i play if the ball isnt doing much ill play some shots
5932767 if it is moving a bit ill sit in and get through the new ball just do what is right for the team
5932768 when youre going at six the ball tends to be old and is doing a bit less
5932769 at three you could be in second ball or the 10th over and the ball is still doing a bit
5932770 you get more value for your shots if you pierce the field compared to batting at six where you start slowly and pick up your scoring rate
5932771 im looking to play the same role as i have in the past for middlesex the only difference being a different shirt
5932772 i have a lot of family still there and in one way if the board made a decision to go it would be an excuse to see the family
5932773 but obviously we all have concerns and because of my background growing up there i do know what karachi can be like
5932774 the whole team has got concerns about going and were all waiting for a decision to be made by the board and we will have to see what happens
5932775 maka tetaplah kamu pada jalan yang benar sebagaimana diperintahkan kepadamu dan juga orang yang telah taubat beserta kamu dan janganlah kamu melampaui batas sesungguhnya dia maha melihat apa yang kamu kerjakan
5932776 ojibwa has a long history of families some families who attended school here their children come to school here grandchildren come to school here
5932777 ever since i was young we all went to ojibwa me and my brothers and sisters graduated from there and were excited about this new school so my children go to ojibwa now
5932778 feels great weve been waiting a long time for this
5932779 this is my new classroom so ill bring you in
5932780 everything is brand new its a new start for the kids a new start for the teachers everyones real excited to be here
5932781 they said youre not going to make it but we made it people we made it
5932782 im going to be standing out here looking at their faces when they see this grand entryway and thats going to make it all worthwhile
5932783 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
5932784 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
5932785 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
5932786 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices
5932787 science and art of deploying political economic psychological and military force
5932788 you have spoiled me and i dont want to let you go
5932789 maybe you can know if you are right for each other in three months
5932790 if youre not using bounce rate as a filter to fix things really fast than you are probably committing a crime against humanity
5932791 embrace the hoard of barbarians they are going to define your brands
5932792 if the only tool you have is a hammer than every problem is a nail
5932793 a strong call to action is more important than clicks for local business
5932794 you can own a large percentage of a google search results page with some clever video optimization
5932795 a way to keep content and the ad very pure users are very interested in the ad content itself
5932796 the way users interact in video search is more of a search and browse mentality whereas in regular search it is more of a search and refine mentality
5932797 its the text search engine that brings visitors to the site and then how they merchandise the content on the site determines which content wins and which content loses
5932798 the chinese users are relatively more engaged theyre more involved when it comes to the internet because their choices in other media are limited
5932799 when somebody sees something is working in a particular industry all of the competitors have a tendency to jump in behind
5932800 theres more access to internet through mobile than pc in japan
5932801 a lot of whats going on in latin america is a precursor to whats going on in the u
5932802 search is another tool in your box but not the sole thing thats going to make it happen for you in reaching this market
5932803 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5932804 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5932805 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5932806 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5932807 la piedra filosofal era un fuego auto transformante que dirig a sus almas hacia arriba
5932808 things are done quickly and with no planning this is why people in lima are suffering and wasting time
5932809 if i accepted your media philosophy we would have to exclude 40 per cent of smer sympathisers and all ls hzds and sns sympathisers that would leave 70 per cent of people without any opportunity to be involved in the projects
5932810 mr speaker i stand before you today to offer an apology to former students of indian residential schools the treatment of children in indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history today we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong has caused great harm and has no place in our country the government now recognizes that the consequences of the indian residential schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on aboriginal culture heritage and language
5932811 never again will this house consider us the indian problem just for being who we are we heard the government of canada take full responsibility for this dreadful chapter in our shared history we heard the prime minister declare that this will never happen again finally we heard canada say it is sorry
5932812 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5932813 we think the death penalty deters absolutely nobody from committing a crime the option of life in prison needs to be studied in the u s crime and violence continue to be rampant with 14 year olds murdering their peers
5932814 i am in the centre like the hole in a poncho
5932815 if it doesnt meet them then we are exposing the company to the risk of something going wrong and we cant do that
5932816 ini bukan hanya medali perunggu tetapi perunggu di era modern
5932817 lebih susah bagi nick karena ada pelari dari afrika dan aljazair maroko dan kenyan yang harus ditundukkan ia melakukannya dengan baik
5932818 ini adalah akibat tapi ini adalah kehormatan bagi prancis dan tentaranya yang mempertahankan hal itu
5932819 tindakan tindakan serius serangan udara diberikan dan untuk membebaskan prajurit prajurit kami yang terperangkap di dalam serangan sengit itu
5932820 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
5932821 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
5932822 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
5932823 no estar encuadrado en la ense anza militar de formaci n ni en la de perfeccionamiento ni en los altos estudios de la defensa
5932824 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable

5932826 there are no big problems i have all my marbles
5932827 i asked my father what i should ask and he said ask him why we have more state senators and representatives than california
5932828 the response i received was that pennsylvania residents receive better service
5932829 id say that 90 to 95 percent of the clinton supporters are 100 percent behind sen obama right now
5932830 theres somewhere between 5 and 10 percent that arent there yet and i think the vast majority of that 5 to 10 percent will be there after the democratic national convention
5932831 look when you work for a candidate its very very hard to just turn off your emotions and then turn them back on like a light switch you cant do that it takes some time
5932832 i tell hillary supporters that if you believe in her goals there is no choice sen obama will achieve 100 percent of those goals sen mccain maybe less than 10 to 15 percent of them he said
5932833 i have a lot of confidence in evan bayh and i think if he were on the ticket that might help me decide to who vote for
5932834 it probably wouldnt make a difference to me i probably would vote for obama pretty much regardless of his vp selection
5932835 its hard to say the vp pick makes any kind of huge difference when you think about all the things really matter in terms of voting for president
5932836 i think what you see is a lot of organizational spill over a lot of resources from the chicago area can be converted and put to work in the hooiser state
5932837 presenter though thats a bit of a hang over from other frameworks monorail ror this directory is where i have the homepresenter class weve been discussing
5932838 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5932839 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5932840 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5932841 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5932842 ive been working on proving myself every single day ive been trying to prove to myself to the coaches and to my teammates that i can earn this spot again
5932843 he had a very good spring and summer last year enough for us to decide that he was our starter
5932844 i thought it was only fair that he come back and not only compete but probably take the job
5932845 and he did that if he had stumbled along the way had he shown rust or not been confident that would have shown early and that didnt happen he came in like it was his job from day 1 and he hasnt let anyone take it away from him
5932846 a lot of guys have injuries and they approach the redshirt differently
5932847 for some guys its a year off for some guys its a year to sulk for some guys they take advantage of it
5932848 i think thats what billy did hes a little bit stronger his arm is stronger he was in every meeting last year so it gave him another year to learn the offense and see defenses and try to make himself better
5932849 im going to experience some ups and downs i watched tyler for two years seeing every up and down a season can have ive seen everything that can possibly happen
5932850 i just havent experienced it physically being on the field i know how to react to those things but its a lot different being out there on the field i just have to be mentally prepared for all of that
5932851 i know it sounds cliche but ive been waiting so long for this this is my fourth year and finally hopefully ill get that chance again
5932852 every time we go on the field defensively i expect us not to be streaky
5932853 and in my opinion weve been streaky weve been up and down and there have been no excuses for that we have to get a little more consistent
5932854 what would happen if all of the ads disappeared from the internet would you have an internet
5932855 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5932856 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5932857 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5932858 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5932859 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5932860 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5932861 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5932862 that is evident in the disclosure report filed eight days before the 2006 general election
5932863 even more telling were nine contributions totaling 2 275 received by stevenson on oct
5932864 many of those names are not associated with the nursing home industry but they have one thing in common they are represented by one of the most powerful lobbying firms in missouri gamble amp schlemeier headed by william gamble and jorgen schlemeier
5932865 two months after receiving more than 3 000 in contributions that can reasonably be connected to the nursing home industry bryan stevenson behind closed doors made a considered though unsuccessful effort to gut nursing home reform
5932866 i just wanted to come out and make a statement that im back and let my teammates know
5932867 i havent played well since the first two games and ive been down on myself not contributing as much as id like
5932868 my first thought was to stop their run villa said but she had visions of the 2004 olympics where the americans let down against italy and settled for a bronze medal
5932869 pipeline team the americans now face ninth seeded netherlands with a group of mostly first time olympians leading what could their first olympic title

5932875 from the loins of this indicating to abbas will come a youth who will fill the earth with transgression and injustice and from the loins of this indicating to ali a man who will fill the earth with fairness and justice if you see this pay attention to the tamimi youth who will come from the direction of the east he is the owner of the banner of al mahdi
5932876 in front of the banner of al mahdi will come a youth whose beard is yellowish and thin if he fights the mountains he will destroy th em until he reaches alya
5932877 the black banners will come to you from the east their hearts are like iron whosoever hears about them let them go crawling even over ice
5932878 people will come from the east and will establish the government for al mahdi
5932879 al mahdi is a man from my children his face is like a glittering star his skin is the color of an arab and his body is like that of israel he will fill the earth with justice just as it will have been filled by injustice and the dwellers of heaven and earth will be pleased with his caliphate
5932880 if only one day remains in the world allah will send a man with a name like mine his manners will be likened to my manners
5932881 al mahdi is a man from my children his color is that of the arab and his body is like that of israel on his right cheek there is a mole that glitters like a star
5932882 he didnt toot his own horn very much but i know he was very proud of the successes he had at the law firm
5932883 he told me he wanted to live to be 65 and if he didnt leave the firm he wouldnt make it
5932884 he always enjoyed helping younger lawyers and many of them have told me he was a mentor for them and a help to them
5932885 he wanted to practice law as honestly as he could and he wanted to take care of his family which he did nicely
5932886 as she was lying in the hospital bed two weeks before she died patients were coming in to see her and she was asking them if they were still taking their medications and how their husband was doing
5932887 she was too young and too talented to go so soon
5932888 she was not fast was always late and always took her time doing things but she always looked immaculate when she left the house
5932889 if she had something to do she would spend all night doing it
5932890 she was very good under pressure to come up with great things
5932891 cancer is an ugly disease but it brought out the beauty in donna the beauty of her spirit
5932892 t he crystal ball is a wrecking ball of doubt an obliterator of nuance it carries in its finely honed ridges the embodiment of ultimate truth bragging rights and silences haters on sight the ends rout the means the crystal ball is carte blanche to draft any narrative you please i guess thats what it means to be number 1
5932893 when he turned around he was probably expecting the guy to walk out the door
5932894 he gave him everything there was no reason he was just doing his job
5932895 he didnt fight him he didnt try to grab the gun he was cooperative
5932896 pick up a baseball bat if thats your only defense against bullets coming toward you
5932897 its hard to do let alone trying to develop the mind set of what would cause someone to shoot a guy who handed over the money
5932898 there was absolutely no reason for him to be shot
5932899 thats why i never take a chance with a robber and let them do what they want to do
5932900 look at my brother they shot him first and asked questions later i know what the outcome could be if they come to rob you even if you let them rob you there is a big chance they will shoot at you anyway i have a family and kids i am not going to let something like that happen to me
5932901 if keeping a camera pointed at the cash register is aimed at keeping employees safe in this case it obviously didnt work
5932902 the guys who run the business probably have a better idea of where to put the camera

5932913 boredom is the desire for happiness left in its pure state
5932914 something that would reduce or enhance the feeling of boredom
5932915 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
5932916 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
5932917 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
5932918 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
5932919 we would get things almost every day from people all over the country
5932920 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
5932921 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people
5932922 there is just so much these days with the internet and web sites and blogs but this was a story about a kid who was just so real that it grabs you
5932923 i know pittsburgh is probably all concerned about what the steelers are going to be like this fall and how maybe the penguins couldve done things differently in the stanley cup but this kids story was just so different
5932924 the story that the post gazette did started the fire for this kid if maybe i threw another log on to help get it going more then great because it deserved to be a bonfire
5932925 you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
5932926 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be
5932927 i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here
5932928 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
5932929 he said he just wanted to meet john coach maddon has really become touched by john and his message
5932930 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
5932931 now john had no idea about these madonna and a rod rumors about an affair and john goes so wheres your wife i couldnt believe it but a rod just said she was in florida at their other home with their kids
5932932 then john asked him if his wife worked john wasnt trying to be smart he was just curious he told john that she didnt work but that she had a psychology degree
5932933 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
5932934 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5932935 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5932936 if i can help someone else going through this then that would make me feel good
5932937 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is
5932938 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development
5932939 we are pleased to continue our relationship with unc health care
5932940 our networks include every hospital in the triangle and virtually all in the state of north carolina we remain committed to ensuring our customers have access to a quality network of north carolina doctors and hospitals at the most competitive price

5932945 ma non sono un esploratore manco completamente di esploratori non e il geografo che va a fare il conto delle citta dei fiumi delle montagne dei mari degli oceani e dei deserti il geografo e troppo importante per andare in giro non lascia mai il suo ufficio ma riceve gli esploratori li interroga e prende degli appunti sui loro ricordi e se i ricordi di uno di loro gli sembrano interessanti il geografo fa fare uninchiesta sulla moralita dellesploratore
5932946 perche se lesploratore mentisse porterebbe una catastrofe nei libri di geografia ed anche un esploratore che bevesse troppo
5932947 perche gli ubriachi vedono doppio e allora il geografo si annoterebbe due montagne la dove ce ne una sola
5932948 e possibile dunque quando la moralita dellesploratore sembra buona si fa uninchiesta sulla sua scoperta
5932949 no e troppo complicato ma si esige che lesploratore fornisca le prove per esempio se si tratta di una grossa montagna si esige che riporti delle grosse pietre
5932950 ma tu tu vieni da lontano tu sei un esploratore mi devi descrivere il tuo pianeta
5932951 non e molto interessante e talmente piccolo ho tre vulcani due in attivita e uno spento ma non si sa mai
5932952 sono i libri piu preziosi fra tutti i libri non passano mai di moda e molto raro che una montagna cambi di posto e molto raro che un oceano si prosciughi noi descriviamo delle cose eterne
5932953 che i vulcani siano spenti o in azione e lo stesso per noi
5932954 quello che conta per noi e il monte lui non cambia

5932956 i think if im here two weeks from now theyre going to release me
5932957 other than that if i get traded before then then i get traded
5932958 but if it comes down to the last cut and im still here theyre going to release me i dont think theres any doubt about that
5932959 you kind of want to keep things safe every now and then too i couldnt really see the defensive back
5932960 i wanted to keep it low and away in case the d b was going to try to undercut him either my guy was going to catch it or nobody was going to catch it
5932961 for the most part i thought i did ok there were a few things here and there that i would have done differently
5932962 im not one to read the newspaper and i dont even look at the internet
5932963 i just try to go by what people tell me
5932964 im just trying to get myself back to where i want to be and get to being a quarterback again
5932965 being around the guys again thats enough to keep me motivated im sure there are people who dont think i can come back from my injury
5932966 these rules for the selection process were framed nearly 20 years back and some are not very applicable now hence the ministry feels that these rules need to be revised to reflect current realities and changes in the academic world as well
5932967 to do so would also take a couple of months and it is also not a very good idea to keep a vacuum at the head of an important and active organisation like the cbse so the acting director may be asked to continue beyond three months by that time the ministry will either re appoint a selection committee or change the rules and then resume the selection process
5932968 i think if im here two weeks from now theyre going to release me
5932969 other than that if i get traded before then then i get traded
5932970 but if it comes down to the last cut and im still here theyre going to release me i dont think theres any doubt about that
5932971 you kind of want to keep things safe every now and then too i couldnt really see the defensive back
5932972 i wanted to keep it low and away in case the d b was going to try to undercut him either my guy was going to catch it or nobody was going to catch it
5932973 for the most part i thought i did ok there were a few things here and there that i would have done differently
5932974 im not one to read the newspaper and i dont even look at the internet
5932975 i just try to go by what people tell me

5932977 being around the guys again thats enough to keep me motivated im sure there are people who dont think i can come back from my injury

5932980 estrada has no more moral authority to speak on any national issues aside from being a convicted criminal only conditionally pardoned he proved during his presidency that he had no brain to run this country
5932981 some of our commanders are frustrated over the deliberate orchestrated delay of the peace talks by the government they did these things without clearance from us
5932982 meron kaming sariling rules on discipline kami ang bahala sa kanila we have our own rules on discipline we will take care of them
5932983 ano ba mas malaki state terrorism na ginamit lahat na armas o individual terrorism what is worse state terrorism or individual terrorism
5932984 we demand that the administration should not use federalism and the peace process as a pretext for cha cha which only exacerbates the already volatile situation in mindanao
5932985 we are trying a slightly different approach this year we are holding a one day security summit in singapore on the friday before simply because our asian audience doesnt want to travel to sydney and our sydney office doesnt want to travel to singapore
5932986 each of these markets has different priorities so in certain categories for example in london identity management is big stuff we tend to feature more on identity management topics
5932987 in australia we tend to have more of a comprehensive coverage of security but with a practical focus
5932988 there is a similar focus in singapore but because they are not cutting edge adopters gartner needs to go into a lot of issues there is not as much of technology focus each place is somewhat different
5932989 the top issue at the sydney summit is data security in general its a high line issue for everyone weve seen a lot of very public data security failures over the past couple of years part of thats due to the breach disclosure laws of the us making it impossible to hide these things anymore
5932990 we havent seen that much happening here in australia but that doesnt mean it hasnt been going on being a security person i assume that these terrible things are happening here but no body talks about them but i might be wrong maybe were not
5932991 data security in general is a big issue primarily because its showing up the limitations of a purely technological approach to security
5932992 it is a necessary part of a security program but it has to be coupled with good education programs with compliance programs and with the things that work on user behaviour
5932993 our more mature clients particularly in the australian area now have personnel that are permanently deployed in business divisions as employees to work on security risk to liaise with the business to interpret policy and figure out the best way to do business in a secure fashion which is a good sign of maturity it means that security is moving out of the back room and becoming just a normal part of risk management in a normal business
5932994 most definitely in fact were featuring a number of talks on identity management identity and access management are the bedrock of most security infrastructure and process use its simply fundamental at the same time companies can often get it wrong
5932995 particularly as users require more and more transparency and identity management protocol they dont want to carry three different security tokens and have five different passwords and so forth
5932996 companies are looking for a more seamless interaction with systems so thats motivated a constant chase on the part of the security professionals to find a better way to do things and that doesnt necessarily need technology sometimes its process
5932997 its finding that right blend of human behaviour and technological systems to provide the user with seamless security identity and access management is critical of that
5932998 managing security compliance and risk is a higher end portion of the summit its looking at the issues of how you actually manage a risk program how do you build security as a business topic and how do you integrate it to your other operational risk business risk technological risk and management strategies so its much more about management of functions
5932999 im bringing in an analyst who specialises to a certain extend in that area neil mcdonald cloud computing is becoming a big phrase but weve been talking about computing in the cloud for 15 years
5933000 theres still a big debate about what it exactly means and the taxonomy definitely gets confused because different vendors come up with their own interpretations of what it means so theres not a single definition
5933001 im nervous about cloud computing and i tend to want to specify aspects of it so software as a service is an example of a cloud computing implementation and that sort of issue will come up a lot when looking at in many of the talks
5933002 were actually looking at things like how do we provide security for software as a service or if youre outsourcing storage to data centres all over the world how do you actually secure your data in that environment
5933003 i get a little tired of the marketing fight over who owns the concept lets get on with the business of security and not worry too much
5933004 we will be discussing virtualisation in a very practical sense in terms of how do you provide security assurance in a world consumed with virtualised servers virtual desktops and so forth
5933005 neil mcdonald takes a very refreshing look at the impact of virtualisation and how we can still provide security in fact how we can enhance security through use of virtualisation we see it as an opportunity for applying virtual security infrastructure not just as a server
5933006 ill be speaking about some of the issues around the virtual environments social status such as facebook and their impact on security in businesses we have several businesses in australian who are making greater and greater use of these sorts of environments go
5933007 furthermore as petrol prices fluctuate as cost of transport fluctuates more and more businesses are starting to look at the idea of remote business
5933008 there is a lot exploration and experimentation in that space we need to look at how do we secure this and how do we provide a confidential platform for that kind of interaction

5933017 we strongly condemn this reproductive health bill as an outright violation of the fundamental rights of men women children and families enshrined in our philippine constitution and a blatant opposition to our moral principles as a christian nation
5933018 this shameful railroading of a seriously flawed bill by our elected and trusted lawmakers is indeed a manifestation of the sad state of governance in our country
5933019 other ambiguous terms like family planning reproductive health right health education and health care gender quality and equity among others just heighten our suspicions that the bill is primarily and truly anti life anti marriage and anti family

5933023 just as the ideal of classic greek culture was the most perfect harmony of mind and body so a human and a bicycle are the perfect synthesis of body and machine
5933024 when the spirits are low when the day appears dark when work becomes monotonous when hope hardly seems worth having just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road without thought on anything but the ride you are taking
5933025 next to a leisurely walk i enjoy a spin on my tandem bicycle it is splendid to feel the wind blowing in my face and the springy motion of my iron steed the rapid rush through the air gives me a delicious sense of strength and buoyancy and the exercise makes my pulse dance and my heart sing
5933026 the bicycle is just as good company as most husbands and when it gets old and shabby a woman can dispose of it and get a new one without shocking the entire community
5933027 cycling satisfies so many needs if youre in a gregarious mood you can go out with a group or you can go alone solo if youre in an aggressive mood you can go fast or if youre tired and want to unwind you can go slow a bicycle doesnt discriminate in age either
5933028 get a bicycle you will not regret it if you live
5933029 the bicycle supplies a new pleasure the pleasure of going where one wills because one wills riding the wheel our own powers are revealed to us you have conquered a new world and exultingly you take possession of it
5933030 every time i see an adult on a bicycle i no longer despair for the future of the human race
5933031 she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of the bicycle will gain the mastery of life

5933037 i had always heard that your entire life flashes before your eyes the second before you die only that one second isnt a second at all it seems to stretch out forever like an ocean of time for me it was lying on my back at boy scout camp watching falling stars and the maple trees that line our street or my grandmothers hands and how her skin seemed like paper and the first time i saw my cousin tonys brand new firebird and janey and my last thought was of carolyn i guess i could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me but its hard to be angry when theres so much beauty in the world sometimes i feel like im seeing it all at once and i cant take it my heart swells up like a balloon thats about to burst but then i remember to relax and stop trying to hold onto it and then it flows through me like rain and i feel nothing but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life you have no idea what im talking about im sure but dont worry you will someday

5933127 why shouldnt i work for the nsa thats a tough one but ill give it a shot say im working at nsa somebody puts a code on my desk something nobody else can break so i take a shot at it and maybe i break it and im real happy with myself because i did my job well but maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in north africa or the middle east once they have that location they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and 1 500 people i never had a problem with get killed now the politicians are saying send in the marines to secure the area because they dont give a shit it wont be their kid over there getting shot just like it wasnt them when their number was called because they were pulling a tour in the national guard itll be some guy from southie taking shrapnel in the ass and he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job because hell work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks meanwhile my buddy from southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price and of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck a cute little ancillary benefit for them but it aint helping my buddy at 250 a gallon and naturally theyre taking their sweet time bringing the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and play slalom with the icebergs and it aint too long until he hits one spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the north atlantic so my buddys out of work and he cant afford to drive so hes got to walk to the job interviews which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is giving him chronic hemorrhoids and meanwhile hes starving because every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special theyre serving is north atlantic scrod with quaker state so what do i think im holding out for something better why not just shoot my buddy take his job and give it to his sworn enemy hike up gas prices bomb a village club a baby seal hit the hash pipe and join the national guard i could be elected president

5933164 the matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth
5933165 did you know that the first matrix was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered where everyone would be happy it was a disaster no one would accept the program entire crops were lost some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world but i believe that as a species human beings define their reality through suffering and misery the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from which is why the matrix was redesigned to this the peak of your civilization

5933167 memory can change the shape of a room it can change the color of a car and memories can be distorted theyre just an interpretation theyre not a record and theyre irrelevant if you have the facts

5933243 difficult if not impossible to finance or refinance their homes
5933244 these lenders knew borrowers couldnt qualify for a loan the loan officers would put in fake incomes all they wanted to do was make the loan lenders knew they wouldnt be held accountable
5933245 it was an innate conflict of interest because these rating agencies collected fees for rating the securities

5933261 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london
5933262 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality
5933263 he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
5933264 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5933265 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5933266 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5933267 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5933268 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5933269 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5933270 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5933271 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5933272 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5933273 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

5933327 i think that there have been phone calls from people driving down 281 here asking about the baby buffalo they think it is a baby buffalo but it is not it is just a goat
5933328 they butt heads and i think the goat thinks he is just as tough as the buffalo he is not scared when he does it i think the buffalo is a little lenient on him because he could really throw him if he wanted to
5933329 i tried to separate the two put the goat in a smaller pen and the buffalo took the fence out so the goat could get out
5933330 he just sticks his horns in the fence and jacks it up out of the ground and the goat is free
5933331 they see this big buffalo chasing him and you know most of the time it is play and they think that the buffalo is going to kill him
5933332 i believe if i wasnt in this group i would be in juvenile detention or jail
5933333 it has helped me focus on what i want to achieve
5933334 you allow them to set their own rules and be expressive but in a controlled way
5933335 we work together as a team but its their show and they understand that
5933336 the media has picked up something that was already an issue and this has affected the perception of the funders
5933337 they have classed the carnival project as high risk because ours is the only float that consists 100 of youth
5933338 its a last minute fight we have got all the top urban artists who play for free for us but no platform for them to perform on
5933339 we have children coming from all different postcodes and most from hackney and islington probably two of the most deprived areas of london
5933340 everything you hear about young people is negative these children come and work together and there are no arguments or problems
5933341 we have had some children who knew someone killed in the area we have discussions about it and on issues like friendship choices you make in life and what are you doing for the community
5933342 up the nose or tap a vein no one else but you to blame
5933343 blood though thicker than water is harder to clean up
5933344 theyve grown these in the test tubes and been able to get them to mature so that many aspects of these cells look like red blood cells that you make and i make
5933345 but they havent given them to people and see if they survive
5933346 has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
5933347 people who live on earth their souls is tied up by gravity you understand
5933348 i sympathize with this idea maybe in the future people should live in the space
5933349 i imagined that i was driving in the playstation game ridge racer
5933350 note the very close quarters that in real life are even tighter if you see the green at the bottom of the screen that is where a door has been cut into the side for easy access in reality that is where the parachute compartment sticks into the passenger area nik and i are going line by line in the flight data files as the sim progresses each line has a time and action to perform and the result we expect note that i have a stick in my right hand when strapped in especially when in a space suit it is hard to reach some buttons so that device is for reaching and pressing buttons that might be hard to reach near the right of the screen you can see the small periscope viewport at this moment in the sim our attitude is aligned with earth this is likely just after insertion or just before reentry

5933352 the issuance by the honorable court of a temporary restraining order coupled by present conditions in some areas in mindanao dictate that the moa in its present form must undergo a thorough review in fact the executive department will pursue further negotiations with the milf to address the issues hurled against the moa
5933353 necessitate consultation with various stakeholders including those who will be affected by the expansion of the present autonomous region in muslim mindanao
5933354 merely a codification of consensus points reached between both parties and the aspirations of the milf to have a bangsamoro homeland
5933355 by complying with the existing legal processes such as the enactment of appropriate legislation amendment of the constitution itself as well as the holding of a plebiscite
5933356 i think the situation is serious enough for the president to call for a multisectoral and a wide ranging group of leaders who can advise on this particular problem that is currently afflicting mindanao
5933357 it shows it is a possibility that they are also using this as a pressure tactic on government
5933358 so if its a pressure tactic on government we should never allow it
5933359 we want to know if we are to sign a peace agreement if this is for real or maybe just a game
5933360 even if it means an indefinite postponement of the 11 year old peace process
5933361 this angered some of our field leaders they thought that the efforts to bring about peace in mindanao had been lost
5933362 we will discipline them we will punish them after due course
5933363 if we can say we can still enforce the laws
5933364 but if these attacks continue it might be hard to sell the idea of peace if they cant control their people
5933365 despite all these things we must never give up on peace the peace process must continue
5933366 especially the aspect on whether the people they are negotiating with are in full control of the forces they represent
5933367 the way it appears some factions do not follow the cue and just go on rampage on their own so we may be talking peace but they may have another agenda
5933368 it is clear that the milf has no hold on its men so who will the government talk to for peace
5933369 the only remaining act of government is to officially declare that the milf is now categorized as terrorists like the abu sayyaf
5933370 to immediately restore law and order taking a proactive stand to degrade the military capability of the rebels and thereby prevent further loss of lives of the innocent as well as of our troops
5933371 are they rebels fighting for a political cause are they terrorists
5933372 its my strongest hope that no one sees violence as a way to peace an important thing for all of us in the philippines is to find the right framework for lasting peace in mindanao
5933373 we had a strong showing in the primary tonight current returns show we have received over 45 percent of the vote to put these results into perspective during the 2004 campaign i received just 34 percent of the vote in the primary and the general election turned out to be significantly closer
5933374 fewer than half of the voters who will vote in november cast their ballots in this primary
5933375 what matters is that we placed in the top two and now the general election begins
5933376 yo pensaba que me iba a encontrar mejor me he encontrado mal desde el principio me suele pasar eso cuando me faltan 2 000 metros y te empiezan a faltar las fuerzas pero hoy me ha pasado desde el principio
5933377 la carrera no la he disfrutado nada lo he pasado supermal y la posici n dentro de lo que cabe me esperaba quedar mejor pero tampoco est tan mal
5933378 lo nico que no he podido disfrutar de unas olimpiadas que me quedo con el gusanillo de que si me hubiera encontrado mejor quiz s hubiera conseguido hacer una mejor posici n porque tambi n soy progresiva voy de menos a m s y eso es lo que no he podido hacer aqu porque no me he encontrado bien y me he quedado con la espinilla
5933379 no siempre sale bien he hecho lo que he podido ha influido un poco el calor pero est bamos todas en las mismas condiciones
5933380 no s por qu ha sido porque hemos descansado mucho llevamos muchos d as aqu no s si el entrenamiento de puesta a punto ten a que haber hecho otro tipo de entrenamiento quiz s pueda ser eso
5933381 siempre te molestan pensaba que al ser menos que en el mundial de sevilla no nos molestar amos tanto pero en la salida me han ahogado basicamente nunca me hab a pasado eso en la salida
5933382 pensaba que iba a ser una carrera m s dura con menos golpes
5933383 en mi no entra retirarme porque vaya la ltima o la pen ltima solo me he retirado cuando no puedo nadar porque el agua est fr a
5933384 more than 50 percent of the voters are voting for change
5933385 puts us in a tremendously strong position going into november
5933386 once in a generation a politician comes along who inspires hope and change
5933387 the obama movement is not just a cliche it is not just a fad
5933388 this is a vintage cocktail in the tradition of the classic alexander the name remains a mystery to me
5933389 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan
5933390 this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube it will give you a new way to interact with content on the go
5933391 well also be shooting the music video for crush which im nervous but excited about
5933392 well also be shooting the music video for crush which im nervous but excited about
5933393 he is from xyz college thats why he gets all the chances my college is not well known and therefore i have to struggle more in the job market
5933394 your pain is my pain my wealth is your wealth your salvation is my salvation
5933395 i am however tibetan before i am dalai lama and i am human before i am tibetan
5933396 probably in the next six months but im not sure about that
5933397 whether or not we will be able to stop it remains to be seen were not going to give up for one moment and even if there is only a small percent of a chance we can stop it were going to keep moving in that direction
5933398 from local state and federal levels i appreciate their efforts i really do
5933399 its a shame it really is its a sad situation
5933400 the richest person is the one who is contented with what he has
5933401 with the olympics going on and everything going on in the world like it is we got a chance to compete for our country going into it brazil looked to be our biggest challenge we started out slow but in the end we put our chins down and hands closed
5933402 not light blue but everything else looks great carry on
5933403 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5933404 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5933405 we ask that you and your staff will dedicate a portion of that sacred day to community service honoring the spirit of unity that brought our nation together in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
5933406 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state
5933407 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
5933408 provide a nonpartisan forum for you to address the events of 9 11 and the importance of national service
5933409 i will drag you down to hell with me i will eat your souls
5933410 print insertion will decline as a percent of our expenditures
5933411 data from this survey as well as from other sources will allow us to determine the best way to reach our customers
5933412 as chief marketing officer mike boylson has mentioned several times we continue to move towards more and more online advertising and promotion of jcp com as the hub of jcpenney
5933413 gods hand in all our circumstances i have no clue just how involved he is in our lives sometimes i think he has designed an overarching blueprint of rewards and consequences and sometimes it seems his hand is in almost every circumstance
5933414 i was every kind of geek and one of the geeks that i was was a band geek
5933415 you know its not on my schedule i imagine the relationship that i have with the good people of scranton that every single scrantonian man woman and child will be showing up on aug 20 to go see the rocker so probably theres no need for me to show up
5933416 a modern classic about a little girl who wants to join the high school football team
5933417 i gotta move with the acting thing because thats panning out
5933418 ive always been in supporting roles kind of reacting to other people and my character fish the heavy metal drummer hes got to drive the film its his energy and his wants and needs and desires that are the motor that push through the film and that definitely took some getting used to
5933419 fun things to do behind the kit to pump up the crowd and put on a show
5933420 theres so many disconnects in hollywood movies even in almost famous as great a movie as that is the music kind of sucks i mean who remembers fever dog as a song
5933421 you got to believe that this kid is writing these songs and can sing and play them he just looks so natural with a guitar slung over him and its such a great voice and you can tell that its his voice singing not some studio musicians voice
5933422 i got to hang out with him he was a great guy he has a really great sense of humor and a great sense of peace about the whole thing he is the original booted drummer and i guess the spark for the idea of the movie
5933423 ive waited on about a billion tables in my lifetime catered about a million catered events but i also had office jobs
5933424 what it gives you especially shakespeare and other classic texts is the importance of language and how to use it the importance of making strong choices about the character and about where they begin and where they end and the use of physicality to support the character and the language
5933425 people are really digging this movie i dont know about reviewers its not like the most original movie in the world i guess but its such a feel good fun old fashioned romp and audiences go crazy for it i think also movies nowadays are very r rated and dark the rocker kind of feels like a john hughes movie a fun for the whole family kind of rock comedy
5933426 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
5933427 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
5933428 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
5933429 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat
5933430 google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web
5933431 theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers
5933432 im sorry ms clayville the gal that set up your appointment didnt know the masseuse we have working right now is not trained to do pre natal massage we tried to call you but none of your numbers are up to date and work
5933433 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
5933434 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom
5933435 well i reckon i could knee him in the chest to make him let go
5933436 your antics are going to get us kicked off the wagon train simon
5933437 he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul
5933438 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
5933439 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
5933440 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
5933441 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
5933442 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
5933443 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
5933444 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
5933445 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
5933446 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
5933447 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
5933448 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
5933449 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
5933450 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
5933451 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
5933452 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
5933453 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
5933454 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
5933455 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
5933456 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
5933457 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
5933458 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
5933459 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir
5933460 i know a lady who runs a boardinghouse and is in need of some help
5933461 if youre an honest sort and not afraid of solid work you might do
5933462 i sews real what he used to have me do
5933463 youre one of them what purges babes when one of us gets unlucky
5933464 like him that came last night he took the baby right but m sister hasnt stopped bleeding since
5933465 be on yore way sir m sister dont need any more help from no doctors she didnt want the first one to come but he didnt give er no choice
5933466 the quack who did that to her was no doctor
5933467 he said hed take care of us but he turned nancy out within a week after last night he said id have to take her place
5933468 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
5933469 she didnt have the characteristics of someone who was dead in her eyes it was almost as if there was some soul there
5933470 i started giving her heart massage and after a couple of moments she took an intake of breath i noticed there was some shallow breathing i didnt panic but i was very shocked
5933471 ive thought about what it must have appeared to him the doctor told him that his mother was dead and he comes into the room and there are two police officers one astride his mother
5933472 at the same time there was a knock at the door and i can only imagine it was the undertaker
5933473 if we hadnt recognised the fact she was alive i am absolutely sure that the undertaker would have come upstairs
5933474 she would have been placed in a coffin and taken to the mortuary and placed in a fridge she would almost definitely have died as a result
5933475 there have been some near misses where people have woken up in a body bag in the morgue so it is very likely that others have been buried alive
5933476 these are cases where doctors havent spent enough time confirming death the vast majority of diagnoses are obvious and clear and there are very few exceptions
5933477 all doctors are very well trained in diagnosing death and spend a lot of time making the correct diagnosis people should not be worried about these extremely rare events
5933478 a number of years ago we took a decision to convert what we had previously been spending on agency nurses into permanent nursing staff posts as we believe it delivers a better quality of service to our patients
5933479 the trust operates with very few nursing vacancies and the use of external temporary nursing staff is only considered once all other options have been exhausted
5933480 2007 8 has been a period of growth for the trust and it has undertaken significant extra work to achieve 18 week waiting time targets
5933481 to do this effectively it has needed to increase its staffing levels and this has included using some agency staff during the adjustment period the 430 000 represents only 0 4 of the trusts overall spend of 97m on staff
5933482 the trusts are ensuring that not everyone takes their annual leave at the same time
5933483 yesterday we spent 400 on the supplies alone just the products and we made close to 180 not even 200
5933484 we didnt even reach our margin we didnt even reach 400 so we have nothing left over
5933485 what we are going to do today will translate into a billion dollars or more off of next years deficit
5933486 so i think thats a significant start and i believe its historic i dont think this has ever occurred
5933487 this has been an exception from what my memory of the past 20 years where the leaders have gotten into the weeds and tried to work through some of these issues with me and i thank them for that
5933488 i didnt think itd be as productive as it has been in one day and i believe the willingness of the governor to negotiate with an open mind meet us he didnt get what he wanted and neither did we we didnt want to do some of these cuts
5933489 so these are tough decisions but the governor called us back to make these tough decisions
5933490 spending is an issue and i think the legislature did its job adequately and addressed the issues
5933491 there have been no injuries as a result of these incidents
5933492 it must be noted that as london underground upgrades its signal system a part of its signal system as part of its current rebuilding program these incidents will be eliminated by the implementation of automatic train operation
5933493 because restaurants can open up without any prior approval or licensing there will always be a percentage that dont comply
5933494 ive come across rat and cockoach infestations as well as kitchens that are just filthy
5933495 rats can contaminate food quite seriously with just their general activity because of the nature of where they actually live down drains and sewers they can bring all manner of harmful bacteria into a kitchen situation
5933496 it is very important that all food businesses obey the law and supply food that is safe to eat
5933497 most people have to wait until they reach 75 before they get a free tv licence and pensioners will be furious to learn that the former prime minister was getting his paid for by the taxpayer
5933498 the public will be alarmed to hear that they are paying essentially to keep mps for large parts of their working years to cover their food to cover their council tax and to insulate them from the kind of cost pressures that ordinary people feel
5933499 where it is clear our policies have not been correctly followed we always undertake a management investigation and disciplinary action is taken when appropriate
5933500 many of them just dont appreciate how important and sensitive they are
5933501 we are in the middle of fighting to get our school sorted out and weve got north lanarkshire spending millions of pounds on outside consultants when they refuse to speak to the local people who are obviously the best consultants for the local area
5933502 its a colossal amount of money and i think questions have to be asked whether it is value for money
5933503 theres a real lack of transparency and accountability about how this money has been spent and the question also must be asked why on earth are we spending over 100 000 on the salaries of so many directors if so much is having to be farmed out and cant be done in house
5933504 i think this massive increase in the use of consultants is very worrying at a time when councils are strapped for cash
5933505 in edinburgh weve had a number of large capital projects that have come on stream and weve had to get in consultants for that
5933506 in addition i would argue that getting consultants in on the short term can actually save you money in the longer term because theyre only there on the bill for the amount of time they do the job
5933507 if we brought somebody in longer term that cost would be with us for the longer term so were actually getting smarter about how we employ people or engage people to work for the council
5933508 they should sell these off and theyd be worth an absolute fortune
5933509 sure they have to mothball housing but they dont have to leave it empty
5933510 it provides housing for a group of people who otherwise dont get housed and for the military its got someone living on site taking care of it
5933511 i was in a management position and i had my desk taken away i had my office taken away i was asked to go back into uniform and had demeaning comments made
5933512 in the health service we carried out a survey among community practitioners and we found that about 50 of the workforce either witnessed bullying or experienced bullying over a 12 month period
5933513 that clearly is a very high percentage therefore we recognise the fact that management need to put in proper systems to address this issue
5933514 we recognise that tackling bullying must be a priority if we are to make the nhs an employer of choice
5933515 hampshire county council is the third largest shire authority in the country serving over 1 2 million people with a budget of 640m excluding schools and around 39 000 staff
5933516 we would expect to be spending more on bottled water than other authorities that are not comparable in size
5933517 however we accept that we need to reduce our use of bottled water to save money and be more sustainable
5933518 our staff are entitled to reasonable access to fresh drinking water but not all have access to kitchen facilities
5933519 bottled water is unnecessary expensive and damaging to the environment
5933520 were talking about the most senior professionals in welsh local government
5933521 these people have been in local government for many years theyre hugely experienced
5933522 they run something like over 200 functions including education and social services they employ something like 165 000 people
5933523 these are top jobs and you require the best people to do them
5933524 i think we see welsh local authorities offering great value for money
5933525 we see professionals paid a good wage to do a very important and onerous job
5933526 is to give every voter the largest equal share of national voting power possible
5933527 if candidate a has a 1 percent edge on every vote
5933528 in 100 000 votes he s almost sure to win and that s bad for the individual voter whose vote then doesn t make any difference in the outcome
5933529 essentially says that you re better off districted in any large election unless every voter in the country is alike and very closely balanced between candidates a and b in that very extraordinary case which rarely if ever occurs in our elections it would be better to have a simple national election
5933530 all that happens is someone with fewer votes gets elected

5933536 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5933537 vibrant communities strong economy and a highly educated workforce all the things weve been bragging about for years
5933538 the idea that leaders of this party could meet for four days and have nothing but silence to greet them is unacceptable
5933539 we have a responsibility to speak out we have a right to be heard
5933540 theres a delicate balance between providing a safe and secure event and allowing people their first amendment rights

5933546 thursday i am paired with the group megan francella michele redman and julieta granada you remember julieta who won the 1 million dollar first prize at the samsung world championship at the donald trump course it always amazes me to see these ladies hit a ball long and straight i would give anything to hit them like that not only do these girls rock they are perfect ladies who i am sure sometimes curse under their breath in a fit of anger but i never saw anything like that i just love them all the weatherman called for cloudy periods in the morning and rain in the afternoon but it turned out to be hot and dry before i left the club i was able to get up close to annika as she came off the 9th green by the scorers tent the crowd let up a roar like i have never heard in golf before it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up what a feeling she looked a little surprised by the attention she was attracting ottawa sure loves annika i almost bumped into paula creamer walking to the driving range that girl has a look of confidence just by the way she walks she has star quality written all over her i did get a chance to follow michelle wie for a few holes she sure knows her way around a golf course i just wish the media would get off her case and give her a break if i wasnt so drained from the two days of walking in the heat i might have stayed around and followed a few groups but we had to go and tend to our wounded bodies as it happened the local tv was televising the late starters so we enjoyed a few hours of armchair golf
5933547 today i had my toughest assignment i was paired with il mi chung and kyeong bae from south korea and ontario amateur champ stephanie sherlockl they are all sweet girls who can hit the ball a mile unfortunately i had never heard of any of them the two south korean girls where about the same age same stature and wore similar clothing part of a scorekeepers job is to record the proper score to the right golfer but by the second hole i was starting to panic trying to figure out who was who fortunately for me one of the spectators outside the ropes could sense this and approached me with some help in separating the two girls one of the girls ii mi chung was wearing shorts with daisy duck embroidered on the back pocket knowing this made a big difference and thankfully everything went well for the rest of the way a friend and i hurried off to keep a 2 30 tee time at cedarhills g amp cc it is a short drive from the hunt club a nice course from the back tees it started to rain around the 7th hole but we waited it out and completed an enjoyable round but we had to share the 15th hole with a gaggle of geese who thought they owned the hole it wasnt until we arrived back to the hotel that we found out that the lpga had suspended play and left half the field to complete play in the morning
5933548 i had received a text message advising all volunteers to report for their scheduled assessments as per posted
5933549 everyone of those ladies on the lpga tour are very special people and it was my pleasure just to be associated with their world i am unable to spend the sunday with them but i will enjoy them on tv while soaking my feet in epson salts i have already put my application in to the 2009 lpga canadian open in calgary alberta
5933550 tax rebates peter out building a new bridge helps the economy long after the work is done
5933551 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5933552 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5933553 we never went out during the time we were training
5933554 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5933555 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
5933556 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5933557 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
5933558 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5933559 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5933560 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5933561 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5933562 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5933563 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5933564 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
5933565 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
5933566 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
5933567 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the nonproliferation regime under the npt
5933568 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5933569 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5933570 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5933571 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5933572 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5933573 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5933574 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5933575 the russian federation will not be able to support the draft resolution of the security council submitted by france today the representative of france has just referred to two elements in the peace plan there are six principles which were proclaimed by the presidents of france and russia
5933576 whatever the reasons the russia federation claims it had to enter georgia it is abundantly clear today on august 19th that it has no business being in georgia anymore and needs to leave
5933577 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5933578 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5933579 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5933580 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
5933581 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
5933582 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
5933583 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
5933584 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
5933585 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
5933586 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
5933587 they want to know what were going to do about it
5933588 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
5933589 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
5933590 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
5933591 my son went to his prototypal episode warning and he overturned to his pedagogue and said dont worry im a rattling beatific actor its in my genes
5933592 theres no doubt were in a period of stagflation now
5933593 not only are mortgage rates creeping up but financing is becoming more difficult for a lot of people builders will continue to pull back
5933594 theres a corrective process we have to get through here
5933595 over the next seven years new zealand will spend over 2 billion nz dollars 1 63 billion u s dollars in development assistance to the pacific the new zealand pacific development strategy launched recently sets the shape and direction for our assistance to the region
5933596 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5933597 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
5933598 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind
5933599 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina
5933600 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5933601 more like a supercharged comptrollers office than a supercharged recovery office
5933602 if its left abandoned certainly that isnt helpful to the redevelopment of either of those heavily damaged neighborhoods that surround it
5933603 the enemy is withdrawing and were conducting pursuit and blocking operations
5933604 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
5933605 id same to hit as some children as my embody module earmark and id take if i ease poverty more children after that
5933606 dont move dont breathe she is alive and she will find you
5933607 this is a gentleman that knows how to bring people together
5933608 we just cant afford to make a mistake theres too much at stake
5933609 we have always taken our own childrens educations seriously and we want nothing for your children we wouldnt want for our own
5933610 it has to be done quickly fairly and hopefully in a way that will not generate some of the ill feelings that have been created
5933611 now to have selected a superintendent such as dr doty where else can we go but upward
5933612 sir i thought you were looking for some tampons for your wife

5933619 ber das schwermetall thallium in der arktis gibt es bisher kaum untersuchungen
5933620 wie verschiedene chemikalien in die nahrungskette gelangen ist uns ja bekannt was aber immer noch weitgehend unbekannt ist ist die frage was geschieht wenn verschiedene chemikalien gemeinsam auftreten
5933621 if it doesnt meet them then we are exposing the company to the risk of something going wrong and we cant do that

5933633 they invited me to show the film and speak tonight
5933634 its often ive done this people get together and eat and its really nice we talk and learn about serious issues
5933635 i had a vision to share this lifestyle with the community so i built a web site
5933636 i had so much arthritis i couldnt move at all
5933637 arthritis is caused by acidity i needed to get alkaline to help it and thats in raw vegetables
5933638 my arthritis really lifted now im really able to do everything i was before
5933639 im really in terrific condition because of wonderful food and exercise my mission is to heal myself and heal the planet through raw foods
5933640 i lost 35 pounds my blood pressure has gone down
5933641 the diet itself really transforms the consciousness just the detoxification of the bodies here brings out bright creative fantastic people
5933642 i was introduced to raw and living i e uncooked foods a number of years ago through a friend
5933643 i found wheat grass juice had a profound impact on my health and energy
5933644 your body is self healing and self rejuvenating depending upon what you put into it
5933645 so when you are taking nutrition in through a living source through living foods all of the digestive properties that your body needs to assimilate and absorb nutrients are intact it provides a very high absorption rate for all the raw materials your body needs to protect itself from diseases
5933646 they are organic and fair traded which means the farmers that grow them get paid fairly
5933647 we thought it would be cute and half jokingly made bags labeled zachary deans coffee bean company
5933648 friends and family kept calling saying get me some more so we took a look at what was being created before us
5933649 the first three weeks it was out there it sold out in a few hours
5933650 our guys look forward to mingling with the fans and have a great time with the young ones who come by to get autographs it gets them fired up to play at home
5933651 i dont think even at 21 kids have the maturity to make the right decisions let alone under the influence
5933652 im actually an orientation leader on campus and the first question freshmen always ask is where are all the parties its frustrating because you cant say enough to them about party but party in moderation
5933653 for me i think it would be a good idea
5933654 before i was 21 i was kind of irresponsible about it i think if we lowered the drinking age there would be less accidents
5933655 if you lower it to 18 most kids are in high school then
5933656 i think if people start drinking at 18 theyre more responsible once they get older
5933657 i think what these college presidents are recommending is just bad public policy
5933658 the minimum drinking age is one of the most studied and proven public health measures ever taken i really dont understand why they feel the need to revisit what basically was a failed experiment
5933659 i think we can agree that underage drinking is a problem on college campuses
5933660 what we need to do is find a reasonable solution to the problem rather than rolling back 25 years of progress to me that doesnt make a whole lot of sense
5933661 we dont have a crisis on our hands with alcohol here
5933662 i think we would favor a lower legal age of consumption
5933663 while we dont have any details of this proposal we are inclined to give it favorable consideration should it move forward
5933664 but we have not studied it as an institution yet
5933665 some of us not all of us were in the field when it was lower and remember it just felt easier to manage and was safer
5933666 everybody was standing there or dancing there right in front of you
5933667 acting is definitely harder for women women category of crumble as men variety of attain as they intend older same intoxicant or whatever its like oh shes time her maturity and she cant endeavor a stimulate symbol its meet a preconceived idea most women in generalized and specially in this industry its a rattling vain vain industry
5933668 i would fuck to do added album it was strange to not exclusive springy with that penalization that i fuck every period but to impact with much wonderful musicians its same a full lowercase fictive covenant we had

5933674 dan janganlah kamu berselisih yang menyebabkan kamu menjadi gentar dan hilang kekuatanmu
5933675 telah sampai berita kepadaku bahwa engkau berkata di halaqah halaqah kami ada hizbiyyun
5933676 saya tidak mengingat kalau saya mengatakan itu namun saya ingin mengatakan kepadamu sekarang iya
5933677 telah sampai kepadaku berita bahwa disana ada orang yang hendak memecah belah antara kami dan kalian
5933678 kalaulah sekiranya gunung gunung itu saling menanduk tidak akan memudlaratkan kita sedikitpun dan hal ini tidak akan terjadi sedikitpun
5933679 ya akhi kami berharap engkau menahan lisanmu baik di yaman maupun di sini barakallahu fiikum semoga allah memberi taufiq kepada semua
5933680 kami juga di emirat terjadi ucapan seperti ini dan mereka mengatakan kalian harus menentukan sikap apakah bersama al hajuri atau bersama al adani
5933681 tatkala nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam keluar menuju uhud beberapa orang kembali dari orang orang yang tadinya keluar bersama beliau sehingga para sahabat nabi terpecah menjadi dua
5933682 maka mengapa kamu terpecah menjadi dua golongan dalam menghadapi orang orang munafik padahal allah telah membalikkan mereka kepada kekafiran disebabkan usaha mereka sendiri
5933683 sesungguhnya kota madinah itu thaybah ia memisahkan dosa sebagaimana api yang memisahkan dari kotoran perak

5933691 pretend you are here this is your life is this what you would want
5933692 at age eleven i navigated us back from new mexico
5933693 there are a lot more wrecks and a lot more 911 calls and where i live there has been a man or multiple men robbing people out of their vehicles since the students have come back
5933694 we do see an increase in calls once school is in session especially at the beginning of the school year and after breaks
5933695 i would say since the beginning of the school year weve seen a couple extra hundred calls since the students have returned
5933696 things are starting to pick up and were prepared for it but its no worse than this time last year
5933697 we try to be extremely visible and proactive and get involved with teaching students on safety awareness we also have students that are actively patrolling
5933698 hasbro has always had the same two priorities great playing authentic game for fans and the second is to protect our intellectual property
5933699 you know what i want this to be out now just let us make the rest later
5933700 were going to be as annoying as he reminding you every 30 seconds of the shows youre not going to get to see until we get x dollars
5933701 were going to make something you like and keep making something you like until you give us what we want
5933702 were going to be as annoying as he reminding you every 30 seconds of the shows youre not going to get to see until we get x dollars
5933703 were going to make something you like and keep making something you like until you give us what we want
5933704 the robber said ill stab you but the visitor did not see a knife
5933705 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5933706 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5933707 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5933708 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5933709 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5933710 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5933711 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5933712 i dont blame her id much rather sleep there too
5933713 i know that stuff happens sometimes but catching routine fly balls should not be that much of a problem
5933714 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
5933715 oh its you again pay me first or go away
5933716 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5933717 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5933718 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5933719 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5933720 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
5933721 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a guinness world record holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
5933722 we ask that you and your staff will dedicate a portion of that sacred day to community service honoring the spirit of unity that brought our nation together in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
5933723 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state
5933724 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
5933725 provide a nonpartisan forum for you to address the events of 9 11 and the importance of national service
5933726 its truly taxing the resources here in san francisco but thats what its all about
5933727 each time we do this the better off all of us are
5933728 we can only learn so much in a classroom we always work together very well but its under these types of constraints and circumstances we are actually trying to simulate something as real as it can get
5933729 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model

5933731 while we continue to believe bobs stores has great potential and an excellent organization our decision to sell the business reflects our vision to grow tjx as a global off price company
5933732 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5933734 lenovo continues to push the technology envelope by giving road warriors the latest enhancements in solid state drive storage and digital display technologies with the new thinkpad x301 notebook pc
5933735 this announcement extends our commitment to blending ultraportability and functionality and equipping todays business users with the most advanced highest performing computing tools
5933736 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
5933737 i believe that the reasonable responsible thing for the governor of this state to do is not make any decision before you bring in a team of engineers and scientists and you have someone tell you if the technology is there to do offshore drilling off the coast of north carolina
5933738 i think that can revitalize and especially bring new jobs to the eastern part of the state
5933739 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5933740 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london
5933741 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality
5933742 he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
5933743 everything is moving very positively we have spoken to the authorities involved and things look good
5933744 weve organised the show according to the rules there is nothing wrong weve received positive and assuring feedback from the authorities
5933745 rock and punk are not suitable for the young generation especially so during the merdeka month
5933746 decency is very relative this is the issue of the rights to freedom of expression and for people especially the youths to choose what they want to see and hear
5933747 the societys morality and values are not shaped by concerts and music
5933748 rock and punk is not suitable for the young generation and especially so during merdeka month
5933749 pas has said many times that it would never infringe on the rights of non muslims but in reality it is in fact denying non muslims their rights
5933750 is this call limited only to muslims or to everyone since pas is a component party of the pakatan rakyat coalition then what are pkr and daps position on this banning of concerts
5933751 it seems like pas is making all the decisions is this within the pakatans manifesto
5933752 this is clearly an infringement of the peoples rights it is very unbecoming
5933753 we must uphold the right of the citizens as enshrined in the constitution
5933754 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for
5933755 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5933756 crudes just getting pulled up by heating oil it was a quick pop and technical triggers may have been hit
5933757 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5933758 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5933759 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall

5933763 google and yahoo and microsoft control your web site not you
5933764 you may find that for all your greatness and glory you couldnt get one pathetic click from people who came to your web site

5933766 the most profound technologies are those that disappear and become embedded into the fabric of everyday life until every human on the planet is connected to the internet
5933767 about 98 percent of the processors sold last year were not made by intel
5933768 this is intels plan to go after the other 98 percent
5933769 an image a day and an mp3 to go with it for no obvious reason
5933770 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5933771 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5933772 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5933773 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
5933774 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things
5933775 if the perception prevails out there then people are going to miss an opportunity to get a good value

5933785 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
5933786 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something

5933788 i am on a quest to link to 50 generation x bloggers one for each of the fifty states through this project i hope to facilitate dialogue among a diverse group of gen xers and do my small part to instill pride in my generation i want to grow our collective courage to live our time were long overdue onward gen x
5933789 tineye does for images what google does for text we are not limited by words google can only find an image if a particular search word is in proximity to it we have the ability on a large scale to tell somebody where one of their images has appeared and how its being used
5933790 anything you would consider a preview image or low resolution image would work i can take a photograph of a picture in the louvre with my mobile and upload it to tineye and it would dump me on the page of that wikipedia page related to that painting
5933791 its being used by researchers who need to find where an image came from to provide attribution even people who are trying to find out who people are in old photos
5933792 we had somebody who had a photograph of a soldier whod arrived on the beach at normandy and they couldnt find their name they did a whole bunch of searches on tineye and found a tiny little photo on an american website that listed everybody whod gone to normandy with a photograph thats exactly when tineye is useful when you have an image but no words
5933793 i think we got a little assist from the historical element and mr phelps going for his eighth gold medal
5933794 but regardless i think that we would have done well the olympics have really been gaining momentum
5933795 but that chiefs number wasnt bad a lot of other nfl franchises would kill for a 13 rating in preseason
5933796 im sure we had some viewers pulled away by the olympics and that was especially the case as the game wore on people probably tuned in to watch the first half of the chiefs and brodie croyle and then the game kind of slipped away and viewers went to the olympics
5933797 my decision to take a rest day today was beyond my control
5933798 a few days ago i somehow contracted poison ivy on my toes primarily on my left foot i have no idea how i got it it just happened
5933799 as i was running down killington peak my toes were swollen to the max and i had to flex my anterior tibialis to control pain as my toes were being jammed into the front of my shoes
5933800 my top priority is getting better and getting back out there
5933801 honestly after today i would only be 40 miles behind which in reality is recoverable two days back would be tough but as i always have said in the past records come on special days
5933802 karl and his docs recognize that his current issues in his left foot are a direct result of his changing his stride to compensate for the pain in his toe due to the blister hes been nursing since day 3
5933803 hes been icing and elevating since he logged in his 38 miles yesterday he woke this morning with the clear message from his bones that running 50 on them today would be a bad idea since its still relatively early in this attempt and hes confident that he can make up lost time in the coming mid atlantic states hes opting to rest and nurse his injury tuesday and hit the trail running again first thing in the morning
5933804 i will not quit now as quit is not in my vocabulary
5933805 its awesome to be a part of this football team and this university making this transition to the future
5933806 were definitely going to send a message this year saying were here and were here to stay
5933807 theres been a lot more excitement around campus around the locker room everybody is talking were excited to get on the road and play new teams
5933808 the competition is going to be higher the stakes are going to be higher so its going to be a lot of fun
5933809 i think if youre going to try and compete at the highest level which is the only level were interested in were talking about the northern iowa mcneese state appalachian state youre going to have to go through a recruiting cycle to even look the part
5933810 i think its important to get one of these teams that maybe were not supposed to in order to get immediate credibility i think its important for our players its important for the university
5933811 we need to set a statement for these young guys coming in and these new recruits saying were going to be good at division one
5933812 were not going to be just a fluke coming in here and having mediocre seasons we want to be competitive right away and as seniors as upperclassmen its our responsibility to set a good tempo
5933813 the fact is some people dont make the right decision and thats when we have to enforce the law
5933814 our whole purpose to being out there is preventing crashes
5933815 people arent seeing just one patrol car on a stop theyre driving by three to four cars
5933816 when you hit them with the sad truth that theyre under arrest they break down start crying start getting violent but it suddenly hits them that their life has changed forever
5933817 everybody has a right to be safe out there on the highway and thats why we take drunk drivers to jail is that theyre endangering everybody else out there thats not their right
5933818 on the ranch i wouldnt ask any of my employees to do something im not willing to do the same thing goes here
5933819 i realized it after i talked with a girlfriend of mine whos in the credit card industry she said you can ask for a credit card rate reduction
5933820 i just actually asked i said i heard i could do this im calling i have a good history my payments are on time i havent made late payments can you get me a drop in rate and they did it i was paying about 13 99 and i got it dropped to 8
5933821 i cancelled it and transferred to another credit card with a balance transfer of 0
5933822 i cant afford that the kids are great and theres expenses with them so that definitely saved us some money
5933823 its a huge relief it puts a lot less strain on our marriage and its just great its nice to be credit card free now
5933824 lots of trails up there and it seems to be a pretty good habitat for rattlesnakes up there too
5933825 our director thought it would be a good idea just to post some reminders we have several of them along the bike path particularly along this area where m hill or cowboy hill is located
5933826 cooler summer cooler temperatures since theyre kind of a cold blooded animal its harder to regulate their body temperature so when its cold theyre going to seek a warm spot in the sun and it might even be on the bike path
5933827 we live in a part of the country where rattlesnakes are fairly common and we just wanted to remind people that theyre out there and to be cautious
5933828 the authoritys work is too important and we needed to move forward past the deadlock
5933829 we both have our ideas about projects and committee appointees but most of all it will be an opportunity for vivian and myself to move the tda forward
5933830 we have two significantly different and strong opinions on what the 10 percent cap represents
5933831 we understand more as a board that we need to make the legislation less ambiguous on the 10 percent cap on term limits and on whether this board should appoint its own members
5933832 we have from now until january to address the ambiguity and take our request for new legislation to the general assembly for approval
5933833 i think we got a little assist from the historical element and mr phelps going for his eighth gold medal
5933834 but regardless i think that we would have done well the olympics have really been gaining momentum
5933835 but that chiefs number wasnt bad a lot of other nfl franchises would kill for a 13 rating in preseason
5933836 im sure we had some viewers pulled away by the olympics and that was especially the case as the game wore on people probably tuned in to watch the first half of the chiefs and brodie croyle and then the game kind of slipped away and viewers went to the olympics
5933837 there really is no time for any frivolity people are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank so they can drive from the first job to the second job people need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates
5933838 i would rather you go and work for a local candidate than read my book
5933839 on the issues and on the importance of the election
5933840 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
5933841 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
5933842 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
5933843 when i first started to read it i thought oh it was going to be a hatchet job but i enjoyed it anyway i was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning
5933844 we just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection and that is looking increasingly true
5933845 i did not ask wealth for my own it was just to make my rival groan
5933846 giants the parallel lives of abraham lincoln and frederick douglass
5933847 his functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career
5933848 if it rains any more well be in the same shape we were in last night
5933849 we do still have some cars that are still under water over here on bishop road
5933850 there was a definite need in this community primarily on the indian reservations where economically challenged kids need bikes and transportation and just things to play with
5933851 bicycles were just the greatest thing those kids have seen ohh i want a bicycle
5933852 some didnt need much work some needed a lot of work
5933853 its not a handout its a hand up in the sense that the kids and even adults little kids bikes up to adult sizes they have to do something on the tribe or reservation to earn that bike
5933854 giving them some hope that things are better just needing to make strides as a community to see that there are people out there that care about them
5933855 it is possible to drive in there during june and see kids sitting under a tree doing nothing weve seen it and you say this doesnt work this is why we have problems
5933856 this whole process is long hours no pay and frustration
5933857 i dont do it for the feel good feeling i do it because i cant help it
5933858 the fact is adversity hits all of us and not just once in blue moon no one is exempt you cant always prevent ill fortune especially due to forces and circumstances beyond your control but what you can do is expect adversity as an inevitable part of life in fact you must expect trouble in order to properly deal with it remember its not a matter of if it comes your way its a matter of when and how severely it strikes your life we must all accept that ill fortune is an inevitable part of life and it is because of not in spite of misfortune that we grow you see our character will never be fully tested until things are not going our way those who have the courage to success in spite of adversity become an inspiration they contribute value to the lives of others they make a difference immmediately ask yourself what can i do to turn this negative intoa positive wow can i make this work for me rather than against me when you look at adversity this way you will realise misfortune is a bridge not a barricade to greater achievements
5933859 you really shouldnt feel this way and should snap out of it now
5933860 its sure not much fun feeling sick and its perfectly understandable that you would feel down at such times and given whats going on in your life at the moment its more than understandable in fact its part of being a human being that we sometimes feel down and self doubt and fear i want you to know that im here for you if there is anything i can get for you or help you with just ask
5933861 the only people who have absolutely no stress are dead ones some stress is a natural and necessary part of being alive manageable levels of stress that go on for a reasonable amount of time mobilise your resources an get you goin on tackling your problems the point is that some level of stress is inevitable and even desirable but too much is harmful

5933874 it depends on the time of year whether its flu season time for seasonal allergies or with our younger population time for physicals
5933875 we cant treat sprains strains or fractures because we have no x ray machines
5933876 the other things that people ask for all the time and that we dont do are pain medications especially for migraines

5933880 in my mind its a big mistake everybody sees it and then the quarterback is depending on you too
5933881 we feel like were finding a third tackle a third starter in herb as the season goes on you want to have that you want to feel like no matter what if you need to plug him in at left or right you can do that and feel comfortable
5933882 you kind of want to learn how to keep yourself in check

5933893 we went at it like its a fresh start flushed his mind out and started over
5933894 you go up against the premier defensive lineman and you are the marquee lineman in the sense that you are protecting the quarterbacks blind side
5933895 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging so from that point of view yeah you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of just look yourself in the mirror
5933896 i told him if you want to dwell on the negative its going to eat you up its going to ruin you if you want to start over then youll be a great player in this league weve started that process
5933897 so hopefully hell continue to get better and do what he has been doing he has been really good for us hes going to do some wonderful things theres no question about that
5933898 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5933899 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5933900 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

5933902 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5933903 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5933904 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5933905 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5933906 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
5933907 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5933908 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5933909 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5933910 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence

5933916 we all know that some guys change due to numbers being retired or jersey numbers being occupied at teams theyre traded to however like everything that ron does every single number change has a weird and wonderful sense of logic to it which in his mind is extremely significant and important ron kicked off with number 15 which was apparently the number that his father wore until ron realised upon consulting his father that it was actually 51 he then moved to 23 as a tribute to michael jordan im sure jordan appreciated the tip of the hat especially from a guy who as a rookie with the bulls broke jordans ribs in a friendly pick up game
5933917 so the us government has put up road blocks iran is one of the axis of evil countries and americans arent allowed to enter into contracts with iranian citizens without a background check we cant have any terrorists coming into the country after all the nba is acting to get an ofac license on behalf of all 30 nba teams plus the nbdl teams this would allow any team in the league including nbdl teams to enter into a contract with hamed

5933987 some writers have so confounded society with government as to leave little or no distinction between them whereas they are not only different but have different origins
5933988 i offer nothing more than simple facts plain arguments and common sense
5933989 society is produced by our wants and government by wickedness the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections the latter negatively by restraining our vices the one encourages intercourse the other creates distinctions the first is a patron the last a punisher society in every state is a blessing but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil

5933998 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5934000 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5934001 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5934002 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5934003 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5934004 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5934005 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5934006 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5934007 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5934009 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5934010 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5934011 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5934012 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5934013 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5934014 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5934015 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5934023 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5934024 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5934025 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5934026 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5934027 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5934028 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5934029 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5934030 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5934031 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5934184 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina

5934196 his expertise in building two highly successful social networking businesses from early stage will be invaluable in evolving the mocospace experience and accelerating our growth
5934197 i am very excited to be working with the extremely talented mocospace team a lot of advisor opportunities in this space come across my desk but i work only with companies that have a chance to do something truly special like we did at bebo mocospace meets that standard
5934198 they have already established mobile social networking as a viable business model and they are building a company that will have a meaningful impact on the way we communicate on our mobile phones
5934199 my preparation starts even before i leave from home to go to the ballpark by routine i keep a day by day on every player so i update it daily adding all the information from the previous game during the first game of every series i spend a lot of time working on making sure we are up to date on players of the other team especially the first time we play any team during the year when we play a western team that we only see twice or american league only once we need to be prepared we just dont make this stuff up chuckling but its a lot of work and it must be done we need to be up to speed on what guys have done lately what the trends are read the papers from the other cities and their websites you want to think you know a lot or as much about that team as you do your own team
5934200 each is suppose to be read a certain number of times during the game jack hicks keeps a count and if we have not done say the ihop ad enough times he will remind me late in the game to get that one in so we do
5934201 oh yeah everybody will trade information whats new with your guys we might want to ask about a specific player thats just been called up a guy that hasnt played and is hurt that kind of thing everybodys preparation is different a lot of things you find out on your own but a lot of times you can find out if you dont know the opposing manager too well for that team you can go and ask the broadcasters the inside on what has been going on and why certain decisions have been made so we all rely on each other the other teams broadcasters are a great resource for us to get up to speed
5934202 but the big market teams are sometimes hard to deal with their p r public relations people try to shield their players fortunately in our job you end up developing so many relationships with the players you just bypass that p r guy and do it yourself
5934203 well its different than when i grew up i asked joe torre about this when he was managing the yankees and i was doing the tampa bay games when he was managing the yankees there were 150 to 200 people standing around him before a game to get his group interview and understand his first job as a manager was as a player manager for the mets how big a deal was that back then or what it should have been to what it is now as just a manager big difference is what is considered important
5934204 its all those rehearsals chuckling but it helps to like each other which we do its fun when you like each other and you get along you know that before the punch line comes you are going to be carried by your partner we are going to laugh we truly can finish each others sentences even if we dont think exactly alike we can think like the other person and know what he is thinking thats important and really what makes us better
5934205 i have been in a situation where chemistry was not there and it did not click so what we have developed here between myself and dave is special
5934206 its more fun than on the radio because you guys dont get to hear the stuff that we are laughing at during the commercial breaks chuckling we really care about what we do we come prepared to do a good job but we also come to have fun
5934207 nothing prepares you for a bad season i have been through them before with tampa bay people like to remind me of the combined won loss records of all the teams i have broadcast in the nba and major league baseball i try not to think about it
5934208 everyday is a new day we could win today right but seriously you have got to prepare for this particular game we are doing today as if it was the game of the week there is no other way to feel about it fans are out there listening and they want to hear about the game they want to be entertained thats our job no two ways about it
5934209 well you pick your spots to talk to them and when you dont shrugging shoulders you after tough losses there is a time for everyone you just have to realize when that time comes but we have pretty good relationships with the players as they know what we do and we are around them so often every single day and we have had a pretty good group of guys to deal with
5934210 no there is so much about the game to like
5934211 something really good has going to have to happen to top that right now chuckling maybe they will win their last 40 games of the season sbf yeah right but when they do win here it will be just as exciting if not better than 2005 2005 was the first year of the team in washington it was different and probably there will never be anything exactly like that again everything was so fresh a very unique situation i dont think i will ever forget that year
5934212 the nucleus of the fans that come each night right now are terrific
5934213 we go places and people ask jack what he does
5934214 here comes a height question the biggest difference is what we call 7th heaven the upper press box is located on the 7th floor of new nationals park i came up with that on the spot you have to push the number 7 in the elevator and the only thing above us is heaven chuckling seriously we have adjusted to it its pretty high up here taq its the highest spot in the major leagues its a different angle you are definitely not as close you dont see movement on the pitches the same way as you do most elsewhere
5934215 we have a little bit of help with the monitor both dave and i believe you cannot call a game off the monitor you have to watch the game now the monitor can help when say dave is doing play by play i can look at the monitor and watch ball movement and things like that because when the ball is hit i dont have to be the person describing that ball leaving the bat in that way we help each other out
5934216 we usually can tell what pitcher is warming up especially when its jesus colome because his delivery is so slow when big jon rauch was here because he was so tall although on opening night when everyone was bundled up in the parkas and it was cold rauch was sitting down and we couldnt tell if he was even out there we couldnt find him as hard as that may seem to believe they were huddled under blankets and everything i needed stronger binoculars to see jon rauch there is something wrong with that
5934217 also at rfk stadium we sat so close to the field almost as if we were sitting right over top of home plate that has made this change here at new nationals park so different
5934218 the other big adjustment up here is to make sure we dont knock anything over the edge because it will drop like a scud missile going down if we drop a cup of coffee the people in the gallery level are going to get wet in the visiting broadcast booth they have knocked a couple of drinks out so we have been very careful here
5934219 unquestionably that is the hardest part of this job being away with the family living in florida is difficult this time of year the family has gone home because school is starting i am actually sneaking out on sunday night after the last home game for one day before catching up with the team for tuesday nights game in philadelphia which quite honestly is something i havent done enough of but i just had to do it we have an off day so i get to see them his family for sunday night and monday then fly out on tuesday morning
5934220 i am up with the kids in the morning getting them off to school i attend all their programs the beginning of the off season starts out with a few days of 100 nothing once i get there i need to go from the bed to the refrigerator to the couch to the pool and then some sequence like that for about two days you have to for nearly 8 months you have basically been going no stop there are very few off days during any season and i need it just to unwind the rigors of the schedule seemingly have us with most of the days off in april amp may then in august when you are dying for a day off there isnt one weve got this crazy stretch coming up next week where we play in philadelphia on a thursday night and then friday afternoon in chicago
5934221 i do like wrigley field because the atmosphere is great maybe the best in the game i love safco field in one of the best parks dodger stadium is still phenomenal i like the big a in anaheim those parks have just been kept up so well and they are so clean
5934222 astrodome old busch stadium tiger stadium where the foul balls come right into your face and of course rfk
5934223 nope in fact safco was first for him this year but i have been in every park
5934224 i am glad that people like us if we are popular i dont know what the term might mean in number how people might measure that but we come to the park prepared to do our jobs we enjoy broadcasting the games and we have a good time doing it if that has made us popular then we are happy to be recognized
5934225 to try to sum him up is not easy because he would have been only two in december and thats all we had him but he was so special to us and were going to miss him horribly
5934226 he went in his room he was upset because he missed his mama

5934230 el viaje del elefante dice pilar del r o es un libro coral donde los personajes entran salen y se renuevan de acuerdo con las peculiares exigencias narrativas que el autor se impuso y le impusieron
5934231 el elefante y su cuidador tienen nombre como otros personajes que figuran en los manuales de historia aunque aparezcan tambi n personas an nimas gente con quien los miembros de la caravana se van cruzando y que comparten perplejidades esfuerzos o la armoniosa alegr a de un techo despu s de tantas noches durmiendo a la intemperie

5934238 theres no other place like dr martin luther king jr and theres no other place like new orleans
5934239 i am and always have been a strong supporter of an 8 29 investigation into the levee failures that caused massive devastation in new orleans st bernard and surrounding communities in congress i have worked with sen mary landrieu to
5934240 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
5934241 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
5934242 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
5934243 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
5934244 we have got to investigate getting in to new areas as a sport and i think becoming part of the olympic movement is going to enhance that and twenty20 might get in there and bring that forward
5934245 so in other words government is planning some kind of

5934253 these artworks hopefully give a unique sense of place so that you know youre in norfolk va it really gives character to our public spaces
5934254 i dont ordinarily look at everyday things as a piece of art

5934256 its kinda fun youd find a quote that means something to you and youd be able to put it on the wall where people could see it
5934257 a friend asks only for your time not your money
5934258 she pulled off her baseball cap and her hair was completely shaved

5934261 australian judges just dont vote according to the colour of the government who appoints them im delighted to say
5934262 for almost half my time on the high court the majority of the members on the court were people whod been appointed by labor governments and when i was appointed in 1998 they were in a majority and remained in a majority until 2003
5934263 i dont ever recall hearing anybody suggest that there was some change in the direction of the court in 2003 but it was not until 2003 that the court in recent times had a majority of members who were appointed by a coalition government
5934264 when you look at the kind of information that people publish about themselves it makes you wonder
5934265 i used to think that having a telephone conversation was normally private but you cant walk down the street without hearing a number of telephone conversations
5934266 it looks nothing like on tv its so much better
5934267 usually just when we play regular season we usually just see each other then now we have more time to hang out
5934268 well do some things for them now the amusement park the beach
5934269 when they did that in california they had an 11 million litre tank that they partially drained every two hours
5934270 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
5934271 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process
5934272 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5934273 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5934274 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5934275 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5934276 this is a preview of the future of the internet everyday another site is being banned we are curious what kind of internet we will have if the internet banning goes at this rate this is the simulation of the future
5934277 the access to this site is denied by its own decision
5934278 the access to this site is denied by a court order
5934279 the access to this site is denied by its own decision
5934280 we think the internet banning decisions by the telecommunication presidency and the turkish courts in the recent days have been at least partially arbitrary and excessive in order to call attention to the danger the freedom of communication is facing we will prevent the access to zargan voluntarily until the midnight of august 20
5934281 rising inflation and the rbis attempts to combat it through monetary tightening are leading to fears of the investment boom in india cooling off
5934282 the relentless rise in the flow of fresh capital investments reflects india incs confidence in the continuation of buoyancy in the consumption demand
5934283 it is not a very significant burden to make them cancel their fresh investment plans or stall those under implementation
5934284 our close monitoring of projects through the cmie capex service shows an acceleration in the announcement of fresh investment
5934285 we are currently working on the structure of the joint venture agreement we expect to finalise the operating structure by september once a mutual agreement is reached the new company is expected to get operational in the next three to six months
5934286 finalisation of an agreement is taking longer thanexpected due to the complex nature of the management of palletflows in the wal mart network and the involvement of a numberof third party pallet management service providers in the newarrangements

5934293 we will be submitting additional analyses to u s epa to support our position
5934294 we are hopeful that u s epa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly
5934295 i didnt imagine that we would score like this it was such a big margin
5934296 this argentinian team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics in order to win the gold medal
5934297 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team
5934298 the reason for it all is very simple they are the two south american teams with the most world titles and theyre almost always there in the final rounds of the biggest tournaments
5934299 its an historical rivalry and every time they meet theres always a lot of expectation this time was no exception of course
5934300 to win against brazil is very important not just for me but for the argentinean team
5934301 i saw maradona in the vip area and we have a wonderful relationship with him to see him very happy makes me very happy too now i hope to take the gold medal to our country like we promised
5934302 it was great we played with a lot of confidence as a team we always try to play well we work really hard
5934303 for us the semi finals and the final are the same we treat them with equal importance so this win is a great boost for the team
5934304 got to run im late for class reply you soon honey love sarah
5934305 how to get a special girl to like me when she doesnt even know i exist
5934306 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
5934307 i guess it is true that blondes have more fun
5934308 we are not provoking native communities but safeguarding areas that are of strategic importance for the country
5934309 the government has declared open war on indigenous people and the demonstrators will stay there until the problem is solved they prefer to die there they arent afraid
5934310 they are being stage managed by a group of lawyers who are deliberately misinforming them
5934311 we want to provide a solution to the fair demands of these communities because the government continues to act arrogantly without any ability to dialogue
5934312 the underlying problem is that the government is attempting to portray indigenous people as just another group of poor people without admitting that they have a different way of life a different cultural viewpoint
5934313 the authorities think they can calm the demands of indigenous people by building schools or medical clinics but the pending debt to the indigenous population is much more complex than that
5934314 they should not be seen as inferior because of their attempt to block the influx of private investment into their territories
5934315 the problem is that peru has a hard time seeing cultural differences as something positive as part of the countrys wealth peruvian society sees them instead as an obstacle
5934316 some non governmental organisations that are active in these issues are inciting people to do these kinds of things which in the end are subversive activities because they are undermining the foundations of democracy
5934317 how have they achieved the miracle of being able to bring together in one place at the same time communities so widely dispersed as the jungle peoples that will have to be investigated
5934318 peru which in past decades in the 1970s was in the vanguard with respect to indigenous issues is now in last place on the list
5934319 these protests might end in dialogue but the problem will continue because there are no government policies that value and respect indigenous people
5934320 the event will be held in the old state capitol in springfield where obama first launched his presidential bid a year and a half ago
5934321 we may see a slightly positive opening but when global risk aversion is increasing financial worries have resurfaced i dont think its going to help
5934322 there are absolutely no cues volumes are falling in the short term i see the sensex falling to 14 000 levels though things are not that bad if one takes a six months to one year view
5934323 are you still there dear i cant find you ill have to tie a piece of string to your toe to keep tabs on where you are
5934324 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have for mr rudd
5934325 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5934326 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5934327 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5934328 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5934329 i think they bsp are selling dollars at the 45 65 level but im not sure if its a big amount
5934330 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5934331 unless someone is going to acquire it for military use i just dont see it being a viable product line
5934332 then again if you do a complete overhaul you would take hummer away from what defines
5934333 we have been retaining profits locallyand investing in india we have also moved capital to indiawhen necessary
5934334 they all fit our product and franchise capability we havefaith in indias growth and are also working on refiningour strategic vision for india
5934335 hdfc is an outstanding institution and we have no planwhatsoever to divest our stake it has been a great investmentfor our shareholders
5934336 all union members of public sector private sector cooperative and regional banks are participating
5934337 the government is hurriedly pursuing mergers withoutaddressing our concerns we will decide on what to do next
5934338 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the assembled here in niue
5934339 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5934340 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
5934341 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
5934342 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
5934343 what we said earlier this year still applies now that there continues to be little transactional investment evidence in the general commercial and relevant to our specific industrial property markets
5934344 the apocalyptic opening lines of bob dylans all along the watchtower seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market
5934345 there is no real depth of evidence of willing buyers and sellers the rics valuation standards assumption financing remains difficult and sellers are reluctant to crystallise lower prices
5934346 if the thieves are the funded or equity based opportunist buyers and the jokers are the owners who wont sell there is no way out of this impasse yet
5934347 we were in love with each other at the time we recorded that album
5934348 we were new friends discovering new parts about each other and we had songs and we had the ability to translate those songs into records that was astounding and we knew it when we walked out of the studio with that two track under our arm we knew what it was going to do we knew that it was going to be a hit we knew that we had nailed something that wasnt really that popular kind of then it was all led zeppelin and jimi hendrix and stuff and here comes this little acoustic record

5934398 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5934399 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5934400 we ask that you and your staff will dedicate a portion of that sacred day to community service honoring the spirit of unity that brought our nation together in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks
5934401 it hardly mattered what political party we supported or whether we came from a red state or blue state
5934402 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
5934403 provide a nonpartisan forum for you to address the events of 9 11 and the importance of national service
5934404 omg my cpu is different change it in the bios

5934407 that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden
5934408 google and yahoo and microsoft control your web site not you
5934409 you may find that for all your greatness and glory you couldnt get one pathetic click from people who came to your web site
5934410 it would be hard for any company including microsoft to match it
5934411 they will do such things because they have not known the father or me
5934412 i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
5934413 ela s quer saber de cuidar de sua filha n o tem pressa para o trabalho
5934414 we were asked to understand how fish swim so efficiently
5934415 and it seemed like a natural extension to apply this to human swimming
5934416 in a way that is very very different from the other athletes much closer to dolphins than we have seen for any other swimmer
5934417 almost 90 percent of all the thrust is coming from the foot
5934418 and the flatter and bigger your foot is you essentially have a bigger paddle michaels foot size and the angle he generates with it plays a big role in his ability to swim very well
5934419 if the body is moving on the surface it creates waves
5934420 so if you can move underwater instead you can actually eliminate some resistance
5934421 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance
5934422 i dont want to be too sophisticated here but 2007 is going to suck all 12 months of the calendar year
5934423 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5934424 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5934425 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5934426 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5934427 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
5934428 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5934429 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5934430 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5934431 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
5934432 dicen que el autob s iba mal notaban algo extra o iba muy r pido y haciendo eses
5934433 we anticipate the review will propose a range of options including a break up of baas monopoly
5934434 maar de laatste kilometer had ik geen puf meer ik ben blij dat ik de spelen heb meegemaakt maar ik had graag beter willen presteren
5934435 niet veel mensen op mijn leeftijd kunnen zeggen dat ze debuteren
5934436 ik heb daarom wel geprobeerd te genieten al ging dat hoe langer hoe minder
5934437 ik heb dat paard heel lang gadegeslagen jaren toen ik het eens met mijn trainer over hem had zei die snel meenemen en hier komen hij zag in balagoer meteen persoonlijkheid en karakter en maakte hem tot een sportman pur sang
5934438 het is een slim dier hij wil echt niet terug naar de politie want hij snapt dat ie nu veel beter af is en een veel interessanter leven leidt
5934439 naar mijn idee had hij gewoon bij het grote brazili moeten blijven maar hij wilde per se de olympische spelen meemaken
5934440 als we iedere wedstrijd zouden scoren dat zou geweldig zijn
5934441 er zijn dagen dat je messi kunt afstoppen en dagen dat het absoluut niet lukt dit keer was het weer zijn dag
5934442 being a kept blogger means never having to get your facts straight provide a better quality of life for ordinary folks without growing government
5934443 i was crying because so many people sacrificed a lot for me my brother came and coached me for the whole year and my wife sierra didnt work for a year to support me the first year of our marriage
5934444 it gives a lot of young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big can succeed i came from a high school of 2000 kids and i was only one of two people who ran track so to come from that to get a chance to stand on the medal podium it really means a huge huge amount
5934445 weve been planning this for about a year and a half to two years i think the people down under have been planning it for four
5934446 he finally listened to stephen and i by staying off the rail
5934447 we told him if he had a clear run from 300m out he could have a medal instead of running up the inside bumping and kicking and tripping like in the semis he had a clear run from 300 out and he closed nice and he didnt panic he kept his arms up in the straight he has a tendency to drop his arms and when that happens the speed slows the feet dont pick up but he kept his arms up and on his toes
5934448 we practice every day we started out the first two games not catching the ball the way we are capable of catching the ball
5934449 got to concentrate more i mean we take the eyes off and thats what happens we got to make sure it doesnt happen and catch it
5934450 the judge knows no more than what his eyes see
5934451 the cji k g balakrishnan has written to chief justices of all high courts to consider adopting the apex court judges practice of declaring their assets at the time of their appointment and every year subsequently
5934452 the high court judges may consider adopting a similar resolution in case it does not have a system of judges declaring their assets soon after the assumption of office and regularly updating the declaration made by them
5934453 it is essential for an independent strong and respected judiciary and indispensable for impartial administration of justice
5934454 the pre existing and universally accepted norms guidelines and conventions
5934455 at the time of their appointment every supreme court judge has to declare his assets thereafter if any property is purchased he has to give the information to me in a sealed cover
5934456 this must be the case with high court judges who would furnish the information to the chief justice of the high court concerned
5934457 there are statutory provisions in the us apex court on disclosure of assets by judges there is an urgent need that such provision should be implemented in india too
5934458 i dont think the economic slowdown will have any impact on the best b schools in the country the final placements too will be smooth
5934459 the 2009 batch which underwent summer internship this year is more experienced than the previous batch
5934460 even if the ppos remain at the same level as last year we would be happy considering that most international recruiters are from the banking and financial sectors hit by the us sub prime crisis we do not expect an enthusiastic response even at the final placement stage
5934461 send me a daily summary email only if ive created a jott
5934462 not just a rock show but a show by an artist with at least x number of songs in my itunes library awesome
5934463 why cant itunes tell me when bands i love are coming
5934464 hay que condenar en rgicamente la violencia de los bloqueos
5934465 and its only 33 63 for the whole year its easy to use and its all right there
5934466 we know that indians are among our ardent readers however we dont have plans now to have a hindi version of our website due to huge expenses involved
5934467 if we can do it economically in the future we will consider opening our website in hindi language
5934468 thanks to a decades efforts peoples daily online has made itself one of the most authoritative comprehensive and influential websites and a disseminator of information
5934469 peoples daily brings you the latest news dispatches of policy information and resolutions of the chinese government and major domestic news and international news releases from china
5934470 it reflects the views of the chinese people and the government
5934471 tineye does for images what google does for text we are not limited by words google can only find an image if a particular search word is in proximity to it we have the ability on a large scale to tell somebody where one of their images has appeared and how its being used
5934472 anything you would consider a preview image or low resolution image would work i can take a photograph of a picture in the louvre with my mobile and upload it to tineye and it would dump me on the page of that wikipedia page related to that painting
5934473 its being used by researchers who need to find where an image came from to provide attribution even people who are trying to find out who people are in old photos
5934474 we had somebody who had a photograph of a soldier whod arrived on the beach at normandy and they couldnt find their name they did a whole bunch of searches on tineye and found a tiny little photo on an american website that listed everybody whod gone to normandy with a photograph thats exactly when tineye is useful when you have an image but no words
5934475 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5934476 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5934477 at that time we contacted searching for bigfoot ceo tom biscardi who was present at the press conference who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process
5934478 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5934479 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5934480 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5934481 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time
5934482 it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
5934483 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
5934484 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
5934485 why would any domainer sell his valuable name at a large auction
5934486 the missing human touch 100 000 00 threat for a single character
5934487 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5934488 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5934489 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5934490 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5934491 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5934492 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5934493 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5934494 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5934495 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5934496 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5934497 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5934498 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5934499 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5934500 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5934501 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5934502 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5934503 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5934504 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5934505 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5934506 every blow aimed at me is a nail in the coffin of british imperialism
5934507 i am not fighting this battle to gain a name in history and my family does not need any help to survive
5934508 intolerance of others and a certain contempt for the weak and inefficient
5934509 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5934510 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5934511 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5934512 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5934513 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5934514 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5934515 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5934516 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5934517 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5934518 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5934519 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5934520 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5934521 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5934522 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5934523 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5934524 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5934525 they told me there are going to be resources here
5934526 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5934527 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5934528 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5934529 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5934530 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5934531 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5934532 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5934533 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5934534 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5934535 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5934536 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5934537 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5934538 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5934539 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5934540 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5934541 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5934542 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5934543 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5934544 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5934545 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5934546 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5934547 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5934548 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5934549 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5934550 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5934551 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5934552 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5934553 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5934554 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5934555 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5934556 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5934557 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5934558 do unto others as you would have done to you
5934559 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5934560 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5934561 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5934562 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5934563 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5934564 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5934565 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5934566 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5934567 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5934568 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5934569 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5934570 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5934571 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5934572 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5934573 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5934574 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5934575 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5934576 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5934577 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5934578 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5934579 item will ship out from the manufactory located in hongkong directly if this type out of store in the location please accept my sincere apologize of this inconvenience to you item will be shipped by registered air mail it takes 7 15 working days for delivery
5934580 there is no monsters everything i saw i could explain but it was the most horrific thing ive ever seen
5934581 lake tahoe various bodies and other items floating at the bottom
5934582 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5934583 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5934584 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5934585 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5934586 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5934587 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5934588 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5934589 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5934590 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5934591 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5934592 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5934593 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5934594 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5934595 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5934596 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5934597 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5934598 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5934599 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5934600 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5934601 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5934602 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5934603 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5934604 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5934605 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5934606 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5934607 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5934608 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5934609 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5934610 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5934611 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5934612 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5934613 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5934614 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5934615 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5934616 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5934617 highest in customer satisfaction with digital cameras 200 399 three years in a row

5934620 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5934621 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5934622 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5934623 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5934624 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5934628 kathleen sebelius shes the governor of kansas she would be a good pick i think
5934629 hes basically letting his supporters be the people first in on the announcement since theyre the ones who have put so much into it
5934630 once i started doing things like going door to door and phone banking it kind of snow balled from there
5934631 its like if you ask for one thing for christmas and you got it

5934635 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5934636 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5934637 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5934638 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra

5934645 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5934646 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5934647 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5934648 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5934649 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5934650 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5934651 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5934652 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5934653 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5934654 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5934655 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5934656 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5934657 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5934658 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5934659 you got better things to do guys im not the guy
5934660 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia
5934661 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
5934662 any democrat who thinks this election is going to be about domestic policy is making a big mistake
5934663 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation
5934664 it is a pretty serious rebuke of the bush administrations efforts to tie the hands of states at the behest of industry
5934665 is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements
5934666 in the process of reviewing the decision to determine the impact on the industry
5934667 monitoring requirements to assure compliance with the permit terms and conditions
5934668 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
5934669 why oh why dash are you still crying two hours after you started crying

5934671 mike adams has one of the best websites on the internet his articles podcasts and books will improve your life and possibly save it
5934672 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5934673 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5934674 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5934675 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5934676 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5934677 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5934678 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

5934681 dalam peperangan kalian mengatakan bahwa si fulan syahid dan si fulan telah mati syahid mudah mudahan perjalanannya tenang ketahuilah janganlah kalian berkata demikian akan tetapi katakanlah sebagaimana sabda rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam barangsiapa mati di jalan allah atau terbunuh maka ia syahid
5934682 artinya perumpamaan seorang mujahid di jalan allah dan allah lebih tahu siapa yang berjihad di jalan nya
5934683 artinya demi dzat diriku berada ditangan nya tidaklah seseorang terluka di jalan allah kecuali datang dihari kiamat sedang lukanya mengalir darah warnanya warna darah dan baunya bau misk
5934684 i thought i was going to be supporting john mccain now im sure of it
5934685 with the release of the new platform the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position
5934686 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
5934687 its never been as explicitly stated that the democratic party supports a womans decision to have their child and offers her practical support to have her child its an historic step forward
5934688 god on the quad how religious colleges and the missionary generation are changing america
5934689 we believe that moving even deeper into the chase makes talladega even more significant to the championship
5934690 also by moving to the end of october and coupled with atlantas new date that separates our two events which is very beneficial for both parties
5934691 and then lastly in 2009 our race weekend falls on halloween which is certainly something we feel is an asset and something well be able to capitalize on
5934692 the southern california market is huge to everybody retail wholesale service sports entertainment it doesnt matter
5934693 its a huge influence in a lot of decision making processes
5934694 its equally huge to us as we have all the different stakeholders that we have in the sport car sponsors teams official status companies and certainly the fan base in southern california or in that whole southwestern part of the united states is very significant to nascar and the growth of nascar
5934695 we feel like theres a marketplace for more in that area
5934696 i think kansas city is an incredible host of nascar events one of the premiere marketplaces for any sport or entertainment to go into
5934697 were certainly glad to be there i think they will complement each other i think it will actually build a better following for the nationwide series in that very hard core motor sports area of the united states
5934698 la vida es muy peligrosa no por las personas que hacen el mal sino por las que se sientan a ver lo que pasa
5934699 vinieron a por nosotros y ya no pudimos hacer nada
5934700 i dont know i dont read the papers and i dont listen to any of that stuff because it doesnt matter to me what people say on the outside all that matters is whats going on internally and how im doing and how im preparing and how im getting this week
5934701 a lot of those guys are ex players and they understand how difficult this game is and how hard you prepare week in and week out
5934702 we go out there and we work to put 100 percent effort out there
5934703 and we go to put a great performance out there every week so thats just how it goes and some people are going to be like that
5934704 em rela o a tudo que tem ocorrido nestes ltimos tempos fatores clim ticos viol ncia incredulidade e etc
5934705 voc cr que estamos muito pr ximos do arrebatamento da igreja do senhor jesus
5934706 pe o aos incr dulos que n o coloquem asneiras para n o perdermos nosso tempo lendo coisas que n o acrescentar o nada a nossa vida espiritual
5934707 and the lord god formed man of the slime of the earth and breathed into his face the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning wherein he placed man whom he had formed
5934708 and the lord god took man and put him into the paradise for pleasure to dress it and keep it and he commanded him saying of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it thou shalt die the death
5934709 and elohim said let us make man in our image after our likeness
5934710 and elohim saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good
5934711 and he said behold adam is become as one of us knowing good and evil now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
5934712 at the same time came the disciples unto yahshua saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and yahshua called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
5934713 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death
5934714 what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah
5934715 but yahweh is the true elohim he is the living elohim and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation
5934716 i am yahweh that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images
5934717 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith yahweh which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
5934718 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
5934719 i am alpha and omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
5934720 and yahweh elohim said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
5934721 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5934722 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5934723 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5934724 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5934725 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5934726 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5934727 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5934728 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5934729 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5934730 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5934731 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5934732 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5934733 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5934734 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5934735 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5934736 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5934737 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5934738 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5934739 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5934740 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5934741 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5934742 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5934743 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5934744 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5934745 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5934746 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5934747 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5934748 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5934749 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5934750 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5934751 select from recent tweets where sql query mentioned specialized geodata database
5934752 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5934753 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5934754 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5934755 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5934756 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5934757 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5934758 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5934759 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5934760 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5934761 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5934762 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5934763 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5934764 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5934765 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5934766 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5934767 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5934768 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5934769 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5934770 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5934771 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5934772 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5934773 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5934774 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5934775 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5934776 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5934777 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5934778 ive put everything towards the beam and to finally get a gold medal on my very last routine it meant the world
5934779 i remember just saying finally to finally have a gold around my neck is amazing
5934780 i remember seeing nastia liukin have hers from the all around and it is so pretty silver is really pretty too
5934781 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5934782 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5934783 i feel excellent about johnson i think she needed this so much she proved she is absolutely a great balance beam gymnast
5934784 i actually did seven beam routines before i came out here the eighth one was the charm
5934785 to leave here with five olympic medals its just amazing and its more than a dream come true
5934786 you know what this is the only way we can get out of this
5934787 well im going to make this an easy decision its not going to be an easy decision for me itll make it easy for you

5934813 i am mad because when my book the laughter of my father was published by harcourt brace amp company the critics called me the manifestation of the pure comic spirit i am not a laughing man i am an angry man
5934814 i ntended to be serious protest against the economic system of his time
5934815 hilarious even grotesque situations which bulosan treats almost like vignettes mask the satire on filipino poverty and ignorance
5934816 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5934817 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5934818 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5934819 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5934820 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5934821 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5934822 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5934823 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5934824 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5934825 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5934841 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5934842 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5934843 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need
5934844 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5934845 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5934846 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
5934847 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things
5934848 if the perception prevails out there then people are going to miss an opportunity to get a good value

5934857 andre is one of the top players in the nba and he was a key factor in our turnaround last season
5934858 keeping him a part of our roster was an important off season move for us im very excited that he has decided to remain a philadelphia 76er
5934859 ed stefanski worked very hard this off season on adding key players to our line up and keeping our core roster in tact
5934860 keeping andre as a 76er was important to us as we want to expand on our successes from last season

5934868 i ve set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 percent cost out of the supply chain
5934869 it means between us we have to find ways to improve our supply chain operations

5934885 did china cheat to win gold and why did they do it
5934886 oh yes russia s decision to attack georgia at this time given their previous territorial struggles is quite fascinating it s also quite depressing alarming and it makes me want to watch the u s open a can of it on the russians at the olympics
5934887 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5934888 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5934889 this phenomenon is a growing threat to the national security and sovereignty of the us the hundreds of billions of dollars caught up as windfall profit for arab islamic oil barons is soon to be used to buy distressed and foreclosed property from the very americans that the run up in oil has exploited

5934891 george osbornes speech is both a calculated move to reposition the tories on traditional labour territory and a pre emptive strike against the prime ministers expected autumn relaunch
5934892 the shadow chancellor argues that it is the right which is now making the running on creating a fair society and encouraging social mobility
5934893 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty
5934894 george osbornes latest scattergun attack is just another example of the conservatives trying to avoid tough questions about their own unfunded and unfair policies

5934904 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5934905 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5934906 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth
5934907 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5934908 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the
5934909 more we see a guy the more holes we pick
5934910 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5934911 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5934912 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5934913 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5934914 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5934915 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5934916 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5934917 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5934918 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5934919 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5934920 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5934921 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5934922 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5934923 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5934924 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5934925 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter

5934927 die 600er gibt es schon in der supersport wm f r uns ist es zwecklos hier mitzutun weil wir kein serienprodukt haben und wir sehen keinen sinn darin mit einem fremdfabrikat anzutreten

5934935 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5934936 if you stand in front of a mirror holiding a dozen roses youll see thirteen of the most beautiful things
5934937 dont have regrets because at one point you were doing exactly what you wanted to
5934938 i said you know you have a chance to be a good player but you need to play with a little more tenacity he said i can do that if he bears down grinds it out and goes the extra mile he should be a very good player
5934939 i thought id be in triple a toledo all year and maybe be a september callup
5934940 but it didnt happen im thankful for the opportunity to play at this level
5934941 i wont be the first or the last thats baseball but im glad because it gave me an opportunity to be in the big leagues
5934942 were going to have to gut it out and get some momentum going into next season we either turn it around or its going to be a long month and a half
5934943 we got pitches we could do something with and had some big hits
5934944 one thing i like is this kid is not afraid to throw the ball
5934945 hes going to be around the plate he should feel proud of himself that ballclub out there they can put a lot of numbers in a hurry and he did a tremendous job tonight to shut it down
5934946 its what you grow up as a kid and wish for
5934947 we were hitting the ball good but he was making pitches too
5934948 i was really excited for him to throw the ball the way he did today
5934949 its just so awesome that he was able to accomplish this and that the sox had the faith in him and belief in him to give him the opportunity
5934950 those guys hit homers if you make a mistake youre going to pay
5934951 were getting it from batters one through nine were getting it on the hill its just a lot of fun right now
5934952 id love to throw it 96 or 97 but i definitely dont i dont have a slider like joe nathan
5934953 but the twins are huge proponents of location over velocity and im always making a big point of that if you keep the ball low 92 looks a lot harder than 97 at the belt
5934954 these are the games we need to win playing a team thats struggling a little bit this year
5934955 the whole goal coming into a season is to win as many series as you can and we obviously havent been doing a good job of that for whatever reason we can get that final game to win a series
5934956 we came out and hit the ball pretty good tonight
5934957 the bullpen was really thin and we needed him to go out and give us four or five innings
5934958 i just felt like i didnt have anything in my arm
5934959 the ball felt like a feather i just didnt feel like i had anything behind it
5934960 the way theyve been pitching me i just looked for something out over the plate
5934961 its just one day and obviously this has been a tough stretch
5934962 thankfully after he felt it he said something generally when somebody feels something that we think is muscular and its a pitcher thats usually not a good sign but i dont want to be the grim reaper until we know more
5934963 i went to warm up and on the first pitch it took my breath away
5934964 i tried to throw another pitch and something in my ribcage just grabbed me i never felt anything like this before it caught me by surprise
5934965 i got into a lot of bad habits the last couple of years and im working on them i still have stuff to work on
5934966 i would have invited you all in there if i had wanted you to know what it was
5934967 we were talking about game situations and looking for ways to try to get better
5934968 theres a big difference between a four run lead and one run
5934969 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5934970 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5934971 i think id like to reach 15 wins every year if possible
5934972 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5934973 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5934974 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5934975 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5934976 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5934977 we had some opportunities and matsuzaka made some big pitches and got out of them
5934978 but we hung in there the best we could when your teams playing good everything seems to go your way and when its not going your way it seems like guys out in the field got extra gloves on
5934979 we had the right guys up there and it didnt happen
5934980 now that you said it i think someones going to get that hit
5934981 it doesnt matter whether the bases are loaded or not my job is to not allow the runners to score if theres a base empty of course its a little easier but its not something i worry about
5934982 sometimes we as hitters as players put a little too much pressure on ourselves
5934983 youve still got to see the ball and hit the ball its not like hes going to make up a pitch with the bases loaded
5934984 we just have to pick up the slack and do the best we can at this point i dont even know what else the organization can do
5934985 its nice to be on the other end of one of those games someone elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt its amazing how that works sometimes
5934986 its the toughest situation a bullpen can be put in and every reliever should crave it i know i do
5934987 i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i paid for it it doesnt matter how many times you get a guy out the one time you dont stinks
5934988 i think i just got the jitters its a different atmosphere once i settled down i did good
5934989 to hold them right there probably was the turning point in the game
5934990 he was making good hitters not real comfortable and thats a great sign
5934991 hes been building toward this and hopefully he can maintain some of it
5934992 watching cc made me realize a whole bunch of things
5934993 i challenged all of their hitters no matter who it was i think i threw more fastballs than i had thrown all year
5934994 every time we play these guys its never an easy win
5934995 they dont lay down and that ninth inning has always been an adventure
5934996 i was able to make the pitches that i had to make to limit the damage
5934997 i made one bad pitch and it cost us the game
5934998 i think maybe a new league seeing new guys and they havent seen me that much
5934999 the more i see them i have to make adjustments and the more they see me theyll be making adjustments but i definitely think it makes a difference
5935000 we just got to watch him keep him fresh and keep him strong
5935001 this kid is a competitor he pitches with confidence and hes done a real nice job here obviously
5935002 one thing about our pitching staff for a good while now theyve given us the chance to win games on a continual basis
5935003 the thing about him is hell throw 88 mph 89 90 and then when he gets to two strikes he can pump it up to 94 or 96
5935004 thats as well as hes thrown the ball since early in the year
5935005 i was looking behind my shoulder and he was freezing thats why i went to first it was a tough play
5935006 i just followed the third baseman down the line and i was pretty far down and whenever he let go of the ball i thought it was going to be a cruise
5935007 but im not that fast so i just got to go headfirst into home plate luckily i scored
5935008 i am just struggling right now i made some pitches when i had to my mechanics are off and i just need to work on it friday and saturday in the bullpen
5935009 we got some big hits and made some big defensive plays tonight
5935010 i know that sounds a little weird with ben sheets throwing 94 95 mph my previous at bats he had gotten me out on some off speed pitches he just happened to leave it out over the plate and i was able to get a hold of it
5935011 he didnt have the good command like he normally does he battled them and kept it close and then geoff got the big hit for us
5935012 he pitched very good tonight but he made a couple of mistakes with two outs
5935013 it seemed like i didnt make many mistakes but the ones i did they hit hard
5935014 i aint pitching great but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
5935015 in the first half i came away with a lot of victories pitching the same way that i am now
5935016 earlier i had a lot of room for error now when im pitching sometimes i think i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can be the difference now
5935017 we had opportunities to score some runs early we scored one in the first and one in the second and had opportunities to score more but just couldnt get the big hit
5935018 we are reluctant to raise prices in japan because the market is so sluggish
5935019 youre a whore and the only reason you get all the attention is because all the boys wanna fuck you your boyfriend is too good for you pure white trash
5935020 what cannot man live through man is a creature that can get accustomed to anything and i think that is the best definition of him
5935021 the convict knows himself that he is a convict an outcast and knows his place before his commanding officer but by no branding by no fetters will you make him forget that he is a human being and as he really is a human being he ought to be treated humanely i have met some good hearted high minded officers i have seen the influence they exerted on these degraded creatures a few kind words from them meant almost a moral resurrection for the convicts

5935044 you will not smoke in my home and for the last time if you are going to sit in one of my chairs do so properly do you know how hard it was to find one in that good of condition
5935045 if im stuck here i dont suppose i could at least do something with myself sister dear
5935046 i can think of several things for you to do with yourself actually all of them involve you leaving my library and staying away from the antiques
5935047 and if you must insist on smoking those things of yours take them outside
5935048 then perhaps i could go explore the city thats bound to keep me out of your hair for a while
5935049 first dont bother with that shit around me im not mom and dad hell from what i hear it isnt working on them so well after your latest escapades second you can go explore but
5935050 there will be rules no fighting no breaking any laws you will take a muddle stone with you so you dont draw too much attention to yourself and you will also take a recording stone so that i can make sure you followed all of the rules
5935051 how long is it going to take for you to make those
5935052 it wont take any time unlike you i keep myself prepared well enough to have some basic tools on hand if you bothered with any of that you probably wouldnt be stuck here for the winter
5935053 though what i did to be the one stuck with you i have no idea
5935054 fine fine ill try and pick up some stuff tonight so you dont have to part with any of your precious stash on my part
5935055 remember the rules we laid down screw it up once and youre done having fun
5935056 dearest lucinda i promise to be on my very best behavior tonight count on it
5935057 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5935058 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5935059 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue

5935062 he just got in a way where he lost some confidence
5935063 we went at it like its a fresh start flushed his mind out and started over
5935064 you go up against the premier defensive lineman and you are the marquee lineman in the sense that you are protecting the quarterbacks blind side
5935065 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging so from that point of view yeah you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of just look yourself in the mirror
5935066 i told him if you want to dwell on the negative its going to eat you up its going to ruin you if you want to start over then youll be a great player in this league weve started that process
5935067 so hopefully hell continue to get better and do what he has been doing he has been really good for us hes going to do some wonderful things theres no question about that
5935068 the campaign appears to be getting more negative and i think that we were concerned that that might begin to carry over right into 9 11
5935069 what we want the presidential candidates to do is put aside their differences of opinion for the day dispense with their normal campaign activities and instead spend the day along with their staffs if possible engaging in their own personal expressions of community service and just to reach out and speak to people about the importance of national service
5935070 its a day for remembrance and unity not political campaigning
5935071 we hope sept 11 is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address our common challenges together
5935072 we feel and have always felt that 9 11 is really a sacred day

5935088 one hundred and seventy seven incidents of police torture have taken place in the city
5935089 the trend of less reporting in balochistan and the nwfp does not mean that there is less violence in these areas the reason behind the situation is a very strong tribal and illegal judicial system which is prevailing in these provinces because of the biased customs victims and their families do not have the courage to come out and report what has actually happened to them
5935090 he bashir has confessed that he was involved in the planning and execution of the blasts

5935094 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5935095 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5935096 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5935097 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5935098 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5935099 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5935100 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5935101 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that

5935136 mccain criticised me and claimed i was for bombing our ally he refused to join my call to take out laden across the afghan border and instead spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5935137 the departure of president musharraf has given the us an opportunity to move away from a foreign policy focussed on one person to a pakistan policy
5935138 ive cosponsored a bill to triple non military aid to the pakistani people while ensuring that military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaida in the tribal regions of pakistan
5935139 ending the war in iraq will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in pak afghan border region this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5935140 with his overwhelming focus on iraq mccain argued that we could just muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5935141 the court cannot be expected to interfere by entertaining the petitioners writ petition filed under article 226 of the constitution

5935145 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5935146 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5935147 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them
5935148 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5935149 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5935150 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5935151 theres nothing on our risk list that i would term a show stopper or major issue that we cant deal with
5935152 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5935153 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
5935154 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting

5935156 so this could kill him to be dragged away from his family and friends and his home

5935161 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5935162 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5935163 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5935164 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films

5935167 es ist mein gr ter wunsch mit der ersten goldmedaille im frauenfussball nach brasilien zur ckzukehren
5935168 bei unserem letzten spiel gegen brasilien ist alles schiefgelaufen was schieflaufen konnte
5935169 wir wissen dass die brasilianerinnen gerade im angriff ber unendlich viele klassespielerinnen verf gen aber jetzt werden die karten neu gemischt
5935170 wir erinnern uns nicht gern an dieses spiel letztes jahr und wir wollen in dieser partie um die goldmedaille das eine oder andere gerader cken
5935171 wir haben zuletzt drei mal in freundschaftsspielen gegen brasilien gewonnen vielleicht sind da alle negativen gef hle wegen der niederlage letztes jahr verpufft die sache ist jetzt abgehakt wir sind eine andere mannschaft sie sind eine andere mannschaft
5935172 die mannschaft hat alles aus sich herausgeholt es hat einfach nicht gereicht
5935173 mit einer medaille nach hause zu kommen w re toll aber wir haben sie noch nicht
5935174 wir hatten einen fantastischen start und haben das erste tor erzielt doch dann haben wir einige fehler gemacht die die amerikanerinnen ausgenutzt haben
5935175 spielerinnen mangelte es an kreativit t sie h tten noch eine schippe drauflegen und bei der balleroberung aggressiver sein m ssen
5935176 wenn man sich anschaut wie die japanerinnen den ball kontrolliert haben dann k nnte sich der gesamte frauenfussball in zukunft ein beispiel daran nehmen
5935177 wir wissen dass brasilien ber eine vielzahl hochtalentierter spielerinnen verf gt vor allem im angriff andererseits ist das halbfinale des wm turniers von 2007 inzwischen geschichte was jetzt z hlt ist die gegenwart in form dieses olympischen finales
5935178 wir haben noch nicht gewonnen schon deshalb w re es fatal angesichts unseres kantersieges ber deutschland in pure euphorie zu verfallen tatsache ist dass wir selbst in diesem spiel ein paar fehler gemacht haben die uns im finale teuer zu stehen kommen k nnten die usa sind f r uns ein gegner vor dem wir allen respekt haben
5935179 last years le petit elegance represented an exciting and new type of fundraising event for breast cancer research when we talked with the american le mans drivers team owners and fans we realized that everyone regardless of age gender or interest is affected by breast cancer

5935203 to reiterate what we have been saying for some time the significant uptick in m amp a is not going to go away anytime soon quite to the contrary this combined with the continued maturation of the sector which in turn has helped fuel the wave of premium takeovers has created the current overwhelmingly positive environment for biotech investors the onslaught of positive june quarter earnings reports from the sector has also helped to reinforce the attractiveness of the sector despite the massive move that the sector has made in terms of stock price performance all of the above factors combine to create reason for even more optimism

5935210 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5935211 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5935212 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5935213 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it
5935214 when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy

5935263 crossing back into washington on the back road from priest lake to metaline falls i was struck by dinos campaign billboards and the bottom line dont let seattle steal this election
5935264 once across rainy pass seattle thievery was forgotten in favor of just listing rossis gop affiliation is it possible somehow that we have a candidate preaching disdain for seattle on the dry side but not over here
5935265 coming through pomeroy there was a billboard for the gops candidate for governor
5935266 it said dont let seattle steal this election so much for being a guv of all the people
5935267 those are not official dino rossi for governor campaign signs
5935268 we had nothing to do with creating them and we dont agree with their message we do not believe that seattle or anyone else will steal this election

5935276 mike and cameron both played well today and choi had a great day
5935277 were what four strokes out of first with four tournaments left
5935278 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china
5935279 and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5935280 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5935281 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5935282 he had to swallow himself whole and he went there the chinese are like that ok fine you dont like us were not buying french food
5935283 i saw a lot of positive things today but i just wish we could have changed the way it ended
5935284 it was heartbreaking we made some mistakes there at the end in the infield but i think they are definitely correctable as we move on this season
5935285 we didnt hit very well as a team but we were able to make the most of some of the opportunities that we had
5935286 it was a close game which is a great way for us both to start the season both teams are going to get better but this is a good starting point
5935287 we knew if we could get mekella out there even not in top form that we would be competitive
5935288 now weve just got to work on building a rotation behind her that will give her a break sometimes
5935289 this is the slowest growth rate of the index since july 2001 and the fall in the growth rate since 2000
5935290 the numbers are pretty good and until we reach a point of saturation theyre not going to go away any time soon
5935291 these are shows about right and wrong with no gray area plus the guys a character hed fit right in
5935292 excited and relieved and confident we know we have the best resources here the best people we have everything around us to win and were all in the top 10 so theres no reason if we do our jobs and do what we know how to do that one of these cars cant win the champion ship
5935293 were really thrilled everybody was really relieved to get me into that countdown and have all four of us in there i know for me personally that was my no 1 goal if you wouldve asked me at the beginning of the year what are your goals number one would be to make sure that you made it into that countdown then no 2 winning races and so on but that was a huge thing not for me personally but the team our sponsors just everybody affiliated when youre on a big team like this success is expected so we would definitely feel like we underachieved if we wouldnt have made it into that countdown i really feel relieved and feel its quite an accomplishment for a first year team to do that everybody is really excited about it john and ashley robert just all the teams are really excited about having four cars because you take another top team like don schumacher they have four cars well only two of his got in there so it just goes to show you that its not that easy that the big teams it doesnt necessarily guarantee you a spot in the countdown because youve got more cars
5935294 its definitely been a hot streak even going back to daytona when mark got the first team pole were on a hot streak and the teams just clicking on all cylinders its not as if were unloading off of the trailer faster than everybody at every track but we get there every time its just really cool and both mark and i are extremely focused to try and do three in a row because wed be the first car to do that all year wed love to have that as one of our things that weve accomplished this year
5935295 not really weve really been kind of hot all year but it really didnt show until these last four races or so at mexico city we probably would have been a contender to win there had we not had the gearbox leak all year i feel like weve been setting the pace what the magic was to finally break it i dont know the team was so devastated after barber and we all thought that we had a curse i actually went and saw a doctor who specializes in curses and i dont know if it worked or not but all i do know is that after i saw him we won two in a row so i guess im a believer
5935296 i think having the ford package is a bonus pretty much anywhere we go but especially at tracks where you load up on downforce and theres elevation changes you need torque to power through that and one thing the ford motor has is great torque i think thats a positive because theres some highly loaded corners at infineon where you are loaded up 100 percent and any bit of extra torque will help to power out i think its a bonus to have the ford package there
5935297 ken schrader has a lot of experience at bristol and we felt with as competitive as the field will be this weekend he gives us the best chance to be successful
5935298 brad coleman will test for us next week at kansas speedway and we plan on having brad compete in more races throughout the remainder of the year we look forward to working with brad as he continues to gain experience at the sprint cup level
5935299 even though its easy to lose your temper at bristol i love racing there
5935300 its a fast track that always produces great racing for the fans i dont think ive ever had a boring race at bristol
5935301 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
5935302 races at bristol are always crazy but they seem to get a little wilder when were racing at night if theres a full moon watch out that only seems to add to the madness i dont know why the night races seem to have more wrecks maybe its because the fans are so hyped up by the time the race starts the drivers just feed off of their excitement
5935303 either youre mad at someone or someone else is mad at you a lot of the time youll see a couple of guys beating on each other in front of you and you just know that theyre having a little disagreement its all part of racing at bristol
5935304 the best thing you can do at bristol is control youre temper of course thats easier said than done theres just not much room to pass so a lot of the time you might have to bump a guy a little to nudge him out of the way youre rubbing up against people almost every lap and theyre doing the same to you
5935305 i saw an ad on television the other day for the race
5935306 its the one where the guy takes a bunch of die cast cars and throws them into a dryer thats what racing at bristol is like youve got 43 cars on a small track going really fast its a recipe for disaster or fun depending on which way you look at it
5935307 sam gained some ground us on last week so we really need a good run on saturday it looks like the raybestos rookie battle is going to be close until the end of the year so every race is critical
5935308 im really excited about getting back to bristol its been a long time since ive been there in a truck ive raced there in the nationwide series since 2005 and ive had some good runs ive also had some incidents that are typical of short track racing but im looking forward to racing on the new surface it should be a lot of fun
5935309 its extremely important to bring a good truck for jon we have a great truck and its been the most successful truck in our fleet since the day it was built i look forward to not only running it at bristol but some of the other tracks until the end of the season the history of this truck makes it special and you always have one favorite this one has been my favorite from the beginning we ran this truck multiple times last year phoenix and homestead two races where jon ran with great success it ran every race that mark martin drove last year with great results its just a good truck its been good right out of the gate i look forward to seeing what we can do in bristol

5935313 once again its evident why daytona international speedway is called the world center of racing
5935314 were excited to host some of motorsports most prestigious and high profile events and look forward to another exhilarating year of racing
5935315 we had a great car at michigan but obviously did not get the result we were looking for
5935316 we dropped positions in the standings and now we have to enter he next few races with a different mindset
5935317 before we were in a position where taking risks wasnt an option we had a pretty
5935318 were not in that position anymore so now we must go all out and see where we end up
5935319 we havent been as good here since they re did the track but i do like what theyve done
5935320 im looking forward to the race and im confident this dupont team will perform better
5935321 bristol used to be a one groove race track where it was a little bit of russian
5935322 crashes dont happen as much youre still going to see them but not as often as
5935323 i love bristol but i am wondering if the track has the same feelings for me
5935324 ive been banged around there pretty good over the years and have had a lot of good runs ruined but each time i go back to bristol i get excited and feel this is the time im going to crack that jinx
5935325 staying out of harms way at bristol is a tough task
5935326 so much luck comes into play to avoid the wrecks but i must say it is better since the track was repaved last year there are now two pretty good grooves to race on
5935327 i smacked the wall first and it hurt i am still looking for a little redemption there
5935328 its a lot of fun being at the track with this team the enthusiasm and work ethic are just incredible
5935329 the valvoline team only had 13 practice laps at bristol in the spring before it started raining
5935330 that was a tough week for us it started raining and didnt stop so we had to pack it up
5935331 this time around were focused on the value of seat time so in addition to the cup race on saturday well be running the truck race too im looking forward to it and i think it will be a lot of fun its an honor to say that ive raced in nascars top three series
5935332 i think racing in the truck series will be really neat
5935333 were still focused on our goal of steadily improving our finishes and working closer to the top 35
5935334 our team hasnt had the best of luck the past couple of weeks but its not for a lack of effort and thats in the past each week is another chance to compete
5935335 michigan international speedways two nascar sprint cup series events in 2009 are important to our fans and for the state of michigan
5935336 our nascar races provide a strong economic boost for the state during the summer months attracting fans from all over the united states and canada while providing a thrilling experience for more than 100 000 dedicated and loyal race fans who choose to spend their time with us each year
5935337 following the resurfacing of the track last year bristol is a really fun place to race at i like it because you now have the option of running low middle or high the combination of the tracks high banking and small size will certainly make for a night of paint swapping my previous two finishes at bristol have not been good at all but i was able to run all 200 laps each time so i guess that could be considered a victory in and of itself given the circumstances we need to have a great qualifying time on wednesday if not it could be a long night of trying to make up laps we need to stay up front and not look back it certainly would be awesome to pull out a win under the bristol lights
5935338 my strategy for erik wednesday is plain and simple stay out of trouble if erik can do that we should be able to escape bristol with a pretty good finish the constant flow of traffic means erik needs to be patient throughout the race being aggressive will get you nowhere at this track our pit stops have to be on point wednesday night if we are on pit road longer than expected on any of our stops it will not be a good night for the no 99 team however our stops the last couple of weeks have been outstanding so we just need to keep up the good work we definitely have the truck this week to have a great run
5935339 we didnt have the best finish earlier this season but bristol is definitely one of my favorite tracks to visit
5935340 im really looking forward to returning to bristol this weekend
5935341 classroom central levels the academic playing field for students in the charlotte region
5935342 michaels family posted regular updates so everyone stayed informed without them having to take time away from michael making tons of phone calls
5935343 thats really why were running the truck race so that i can get some more seat time on that track
5935344 the trucks are closer to a cup car than the nationwide cars are and chad knaus will be up there and involved it gives us an opportunity to learn some things without the pressure of being in the points race everybody learns a lot more when the pressures not on so its a good way to give me a little more experience and for chad to adjust on the vehicle and learn a bit more about the track
5935345 i dont know im going to find out i would assume not much with the fact that the cars run bump stops and the rules are much different but at least im on the track every lap that i make on a track the more i learn and the rhythm comes to me thats really a big part of bristol theres a certain rhythm to that race track and if i can find the rhythm sooner and adjust to that and practice and be doing the right things when our cup practice starts from a drivers standpoint it will hopefully put us ahead of where weve been in the past and well be more competitive in the race
5935346 in some ways this is an easier position to be in we just go out there and run hard every weekend he said
5935347 we can take chances and do things that could maybe get us that win
5935348 you cant risk fuel mileage you cant risk putting two tires on weve got to stay with four tires and we cant get too risky with our setups youre just trying to ride along there and not make mistakes now a mistake is made and im just glad we were running good finally
5935349 aric drove the wheels off that army chevrolet we had a decent car not a great one but aric drove both patiently and hard
5935350 i had a good car with a lot of speed and didnt have to hustle it
5935351 you bump you grind and just battle for 500 grueling laps its a blast if we keep it clean i am confident the army chevrolet impala ss will have another solid performance in honor of the brave soldiers who are protecting our freedom
5935352 because the guys are in better physical shape and the cars are better acclimated to downforce the tires have more grip and the rear wing is at an angle where it contributes more downforce even though theyre faster at bristol the cars arent as physically demanding as they used to be theres a ton of things on these cars now like power steering that makes them easier to drive than the older cars back in the 70s the seats are more supportive and the drivers dont have to literally hang on to the steering wheel like they used to a lot of safety improvements have also helped make the cockpit of the car a better environment for running 500 laps
5935353 getting the car to not bottom out on the racetrack with the spring package that you have its a really delicate balancing act to get the splitter as close to the ground as you can to make downforce and not have the springs bind out every time that thing bottoms out it literally lifts the corner of the car off the ground and the trick is to get four tires on the pavement at all times because theres a lot of bouncing at bristol you have to make that car drive as good as you can for as long as you can
5935354 chase for the abc additionally espn2 is the home of the nascar nationwide series all season all programming is produced totally in high definition espns comprehensive multimedia espn com
5935355 working with the children in this region isnt just my job its been my passion ever since i was in high school
5935356 being able to help them succeed at school learn new sports and gain new skills is incredibly rewarding and its an honor to be recognized for the work we do it will be fun to take them to bristol motor speedway for hot shot pole day
5935357 its exciting to be involved in something that relates to our industry
5935358 and its a great opportunity for us to be associated with a high quality team like don schumacher racing were looking forward to great results with the pro stock motorcycle team and craig treble
5935359 now that we have the two riders secured at dsr craig will begin testing our new hayabusa engine as soon as we have it available which should be shortly after indy
5935360 and with ellis tartaglia and treble putting their focus on this program well work towards accomplishing some wonderful things with the new hayabusa suzuki engine
5935361 i was prepared to leave team tigue at the end of the race on sunday without a plan for indy i talked to steve tartaglia about possibly leasing an engine and the next thing i know don schumacher calls me and asks me if i was interested in riding the other
5935362 ive been with harry and joanne lartigue for four years and its been a great run with them we won a few races together including the u s nationals last year
5935363 ive also had a long association with vance and hines since day one in the psm class and i want to thank them for all the years of providing great engines
5935364 i have a very interesting reason for thinking that we will have a very good weekend in sonoma
5935365 its amazing what a difference a year makes last year we were complaining when we were finishing third or second i remember very well last year when we finished second at a race and everybody was so mad this year weve only had a single podium finish so far thats really difficult when you consider this has been a racing program that in its first four years was on the podium almost 60 percent of the time obviously our new car is still a work in progress but we really couldnt blame the car for a lot of the finishes we have had this year that were not so good despite all of that we are all very positive and we will keep working hard the podiums and the wins will come
5935366 i dont think it was my dream as much as it was my familys dream i swam for 10 years every single day i would practice for hours at a time i would go racing all around italy i did it for so long i even had a picture made with mark spitz when he was at one of my swimming meets i was just going and going and going from the time i was six until i was about 16 i just couldnt do it anymore i hated it so much i wasnt winning maybe thats why i didnt like it i was always leading up to the last 25 meters but then i was done all the way i was flat out that was the problem i am so happy that i had the opportunity to get into car racing i still go flat out all the time but in car racing we have yellow flags so we can catch our breath every once in a while you dont have those in swimming
5935367 i lived just outside of downtown sonoma for two years 2002 2003 when i raced for the lynx champ car atlantic team which was based there i love it if i couldnt live in vancouver id live in sonoma for sure oddly enough we never raced there in atlantics they thought the track was too dangerous for those cars ive raced grand am there a few times we finished sixth there in 2006 with rob finlay and the essex racing team its one of the most challenging tracks on the schedule i really enjoy it its a really nice facility and im looking forward to going back there its challenging because it has huge elevation changes and itll be another hot race which will make it physically demanding as well technically with the elevation changes and the fast corners you have to have your car set up just right to be able to run well there with our new dallara there for the first time im confident we can come up with the right combination
5935368 we did a tire test the monday after watkins glen and the team has done a really good job rebuilding the car for infineon on one hand im not quite sure what to expect it seems every time we go into a race feeling positive something seems to happen to make things difficult for us i think the biggest thing is that were still playing catch up when you think about everything thats happened to us this year simon hodgson general manager and the guys have worked the whole off weekend once again to make sure everything is right for infineon we didnt have a winning car at infineon last year but thats not to say our new dallara in its first race there isnt going to deliver a really strong result
5935369 well theres not been a year for this suntrust racing program where we havent won at least one race so with three more races to go we want to do everything we can to keep that streak alive this year has definitely turned into a development year for us its definitely been trying at times we need to win for so many reasons we just need to go out and figure out once and for all how to win a race this year weve done it so many times before it feels like its been such a long year and sometimes i wonder if we can just keep everyones morale up the guys are amazing but theyre also human a win would cure so many things lets just go out and give it our usual maximum effort for whats left in the season and make good things happen
5935370 pembedahan mayat orang islam hanya boleh dilakukan jika keadaan benar benar memerlukan dharurat sahaja seperti terlibat di dalam kes kes jenayah yang sangat memerlukan post mortem atau si mati tertelan benda yang berharga atau si mati yang sedang mengandung sedangkan kandungannya masih hidup
5935371 hukum asal pembedahan mayat adalah haram tetapi dibolehkan sekiranya dalam keadaan dharurat dan terdapat keperluan yang mendesak seperti membuat kajian terhadap penyakit mengenalpasti punca kematian dan penyelidikan serta pendidikan khususnya dalam bidang perubatan

5935380 masyarakat tidak menyadari bahwa hal hal tersebut dijadikan perantara untuk dilakukannya segala bentuk kemungkaran dan sebagai penghalang bagi setiap orang yang akan mengingkarinya dan mereka akan melakukan dalam perayaan maulid mereka yang tidaklah dihadiri kecuali oleh orang orang rendahan segala kemungkaran dengan beralasan telah hadir dalam perayan maulid si fulan dan si fulan
5935381 tidak pernah dilakukan oleh as salafus sholeh padahal dorongan untuk diadakannya perayaan ini sudah ada dan tidak ada penghalangnya sehingga seandainya perayaan ini sebuah kebaikan yang murni atau lebih besar niscaya as salaf ulama terdahulu semoga allah meridloi mereka akan lebih giat dalam melaksanakannya daripada kita sebab mereka lebih dari kita dalam mencintai rosulullah e dan mengagungkannya dan mereka lebih bersemangat dalam mendapatkan kebaikan dan sesungguhnya kesempurnaan rasa cinta dan pengagungan kepada beliau terletak pada sikap mengikuti dan mentaati perintahnya dan menghidupkan sunnah sunnahnya baik yang lahir ataupun batin serta menyebarkan ajarannya dan berjuang dalam merealisasikan hal itu dengan hati tangan dan lisan sungguh inilah jalannya para ulama terdahulu dari kalangan kaum muhajirin dan anshor yang selalu mengikuti mereka dalam kebaikan
5935382 adapun berwasiat untuk perayaan al maulid as syariif maka al fakihany telah menyebutkan bahwa perayaan maulid adalah makruh hukumnya
5935383 fathu al aly al malik fi al fatawa ala mazhab al imam malik
5935384 kalau allah menyembuhkan sapiku maka wajib atasku untuk menyembelih anak yang di dalam perutnya ketika acara maulid rosulillah e dan kemudian allah menyembuhkan sapinya dan melahirkan anak betina kemudian dia menunda penyembelihan sampai anak sapi tersebut besar dan hamil apakah wajib atasnya untuk menyembelih sapi tersebut atau boleh menyembelih penggantinya atau dia tidak berkewajiban apa apa
5935385 alhamdulillah dan sholawat dan salam semoga terlimpahkan kepada sayidina muhammad rosulillah dia tidak berkewajiban apa apa karena perayaan maulid rosulillah e tidaklah disunnahkan
5935386 cara cara mereka pada saat ini telah mencemari agama karena kebiasaan mereka dalam perkumpulan tersebut hanya menyanyi dan bersorak sorai mereka telah mempengaruhi orang oramg awam kaum muslimin bahwa hal yang demikian adalah ibadah yang sangat agung untuk dilakukan pada waktu tersebut dan merupakan jalan para wali allah sedangkan kenyataan mereka adalah kaum yang bodoh yang mana diantara mereka banyak yang tidak mengetahui hukum hukum yang diwajibkan kepadanya dalam sehari hari sebenarnya mereka adalah para pesuruh setan untuk menyesatkan orang awam kaum muslimin dengan menghiasi kebatilan kepada mereka mereka telah memasukan kedalam agama allah sesuatu yang tidak termasuk kedalamnya karena bernyanyi dan bersorak sorai adalah termasuk dalam senda gurau dan main main mereka menganggap hal yang demikian adalah perbuatan para wali allah ini adalah suatu kebohongan dibuat di atas nama mereka sebagai salah satu jalan bagi mereka untuk memakan harta manusia dengan cara haram karena itu kebiasaan mereka adalah menyendiri supaya mereka bebas melakukan hal hal yang dilarang maka apa yang diwakafkan untuk hal tersebut hukumnya batil karena tidak menurut cara yang benar disyariatkan oleh agama maka dianjurkan bagi orang yang berwakaf tadi untuk mengalihkan wakafnya kepada hal lain yang dianjurkan dalam syariat kalau seandainya ia tidak mampu maka hendaklah ia ambil untuk dirinya sendiri semoga allah menuntun kita selalu untuk mengikut sunnah nabinya muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan mengikuti para salaf sholih karena keselamatan terdapat dalam langkah mereka
5935387 sang imam muhammad bin abdul wahab melarang kebiasaan orang orang di negri tersebut dan daerah lainnya dari membesarkan hari maulid dan hari hari besar jahiliyah lainnya yang tidak ada dalil yang memerintahkan untuk membesarkannya dan tidak pula keterangan dan hujah syariyah karena hal yang demikian adalah menyerupai umat nasroni kristen yang sesat dalam hari besar mereka baik secara waktu maupun tempat ini adalah kebatilan yang ditolak dalam syariat penghulu segala rasul agama islam di kutib dari
5935388 semua hal tersebut adalah bidah sebagaimana yang terdapat dalam sabda nabie bahwa beliau berkata
5935389 barang siapa yang menambah nambah dalam urusan kami ini agama ini sesuatu yang tidak termasuk kedalamnya maka hal tersebut adalah ditolak
5935390 hati hatilah kalian terhadap sesuatu hal yang baru dalam agama ini sesungguhnya segala hal yang baru dalam agama adalah bidah dan setiap bidah itu adalah sesat
5935391 barang siapa yang melakukan suatu amalan ibadah yang tidak ada contoh dari kami maka amalan tersebut ditolak
5935392 apakah mereka itu memiliki tandingan tandingan yang membuat syariat agama bagi mereka yang tidak pernah diizinkan allah
5935393 perbuatan maulid adalah perbuatan bidah mungkar dan jelek mengeluarkan harta untuk perbuatan tersebut adalah bidah yang diharamkan dan orang yang melakukannya adalah berdosa maka wajib dicegah orang yang melakukannya
5935394 adapun yang pertama yaitu mewasiatkan sepertiga harta untuk pelaksanaan maulid sebagaimana yang banyak dilakukan manusia ini adalah bidah yang diada adakan setiap bidah itu adalah sesat bersepakat untuk melakukan bidah tidak boleh dan wasiatnya tidak dilakukan bahkan diwajibkan kepada qodhi untuk membatalkannya dan mengembalikan sepertiga harta tersebut kepada ahli waris supaya mereka bagi sesama mereka semoga allah menjauhkan para kaum fakir dari menuntut supaya dilaksanakannya wasiat seperti ini
5935395 as sunan wal mubtadiaat al mutaalliqah bil azkar wash sholawaat
5935396 tidak boleh mengkhususkan bulan ini rabiul awal dengan berbagai macam ibadah seperti sholat zikir sedekah dll
5935397 sekalipun tidak terdapat dalam pelaksanaan maulid tersebut nyanyi nyanyian cukup sekedar acara makan bersama saja dengan maksud melaksanaka maulid bersamaan dengan itu mengajak teman teman maka hal tersebut tetap merupakan bidah walaupun hanya sebatas niat saja karena hal tersebut adalah menambah nambah dalam urusan agama yang tidak pernah dilakukan oleh para ulama salaf yang silam mengikuti salaf adalah lebih utama dan wajib dari pada menambah niat yang melanggar terhadap apa yang mereka lakukan mereka adalah manusia yang sangat bersungguh sungguh dalam mengikuti sunnah rasulullah saw dan lebih cinta kepadanya dan kepada sunnahnya kalau hal tersebut benar tentulah mereka orang yang pertama sekali melakukannya tetapi tidak seorang pun dari mereka yang melakukannya kita hanya mengikuti mereka kita telah mengetahui bahwa mengikut mereka dalam segala sumber dan keputusan
5935398 tidak akan terjadi hari qiamat sampai yang maruf di anggap mungkar dan yang mungkar dianggap maruf
5935399 sebagian penyair telah menceritakan keadaan zaman kita ini dalam syair mereka
5935400 jika ada yang bertanya dari mana kalian mengetahui bahwa rasulullah tidak melakukannya tidak ditemukannya dalil tidak mesti perbuatan tersebut tidak ada
5935401 memberi makan orang yang lapar dianjurkan dalam setiap waktu apa lagi bergembira atas munculnya cahaya kenabian pada bulan yang mulia ini tapi tidak kita temukan seorang pun dari generasi salaf para ulama yang terdahulu yang melakukan hal demikian sekali pun sekedar memberi makan orang yang kelaparan
5935402 asal perbuatan maulid adalah bidah tidak seorang pun dari generasi salafus sholeh yang melakukannya dalam tiga abad pertama
5935403 melakukan maulid tidak pernah dilakukan oleh generasi islam pertama dari salafus sholih sedangkan mereka adalah orang yang jauh lebih menghormati dan mencintai nabi saw yang mana kecintaan dan penghormatan salah seorang diantara mereka terhadap nabi saw tidak terjangkau oleh kita sekarang ini walau hanya secuil
5935404 dalil yang menunjukkan bahwa orang orang salaf generasi islam yang pertama tidak pernah membedakan antara malam maulid dengan malam malam yang lainnya yaitu perbedaan mereka dalam menentukan malam tersebut sebagian berpendapat pada bulan ramadhan dan sebagian yang lain berpendapat pada bulan rabiul awal kemudian mereka berbeda pendapat lagi tentang tanggalnya dalam empat pendapat kalau seandainya mereka melakukan ibadah tertentu pada hari lahirnya nabi muhammad saw tentu hari tersebut diketahui secara masyhur dan tidak akan terjadi perbedaan pendapat tentang hari tersebut
5935405 yang sangat mengherankan kenapa mereka bergembiraria untuk kelahiran nabi saw
5935406 hendaklah kaum muslimn itu teguh dalam segala musibah mereka musibah yang sebenarnya adalah kematian ku
5935407 hitam kelam pandangan ku hitam atas kepergian mu ku relakan kematian selain mu kecemasanku hanya atas kepergian mu
5935408 sesungguhnya bulan kelahiran nabi muhammad saw bertepatan dengan bulan kematiannya maka tidak lah bergembira lebih utama dari pada bersedih pada bulan tersebut
5935409 al afdhal semoga allah merahmatinya memiliki berbagai amal kebaikan dalam memperbaiki keadaan kaum muslimin diantaranya ia telah menghapus upacara maulid nabi saw upacara maulid fathimah upacara maulud ali dan upacara maulid khalifah al qoim biamrillah

5935416 bristol is definitely the fastest half mile track that ive ever had the opportunity to race on and it is just a lot of fun to go there patience is one of the most important keys to racing at bristol the race is 500 laps and when youre racing so close to each other there is always a lot of give and take that needs to happen we ran really well at bristol for the june race and finished ninth because we had a great car were taking the same car back this weekend so were excited about that and feel like we can definitely be a little bit better than our first visit here this season im thrilled about driving the ford drive one car at bristol this weekend after going to ford world headquarters a couple of months ago its an honor to be able to run this paint scheme to help promote the sales efforts for ford
5935417 we had an extremely good finish when we came to bristol earlier this season and were actually bringing that same car from the march race back this weekend for the sharpie 500 david gilliland really enjoys short track racing so our ford drive one team is really looking forward to this weekends race the goal of bristol racing is to qualify well since track position is so important as well as keeping yourself out of trouble all race long this will be our second visit to bristol this season and weve found that returning to these tracks gives us a lot of confidence when you have a chance to review notes and build upon what our team learned the first time around
5935418 oh yeah ive been that guy ive been in the middle of turn one and two and drove into the wreck in turn three it happens so fast obviously the laps times are real quick its just one of those places that its got so much banking that as a driver when youre in a corner you cant see the straightaway really until you kind of pop up out of the hole and its just tough its a challenge and its easy to get caught up in other peoples trouble but thats just part of it its something youve got to be aware of and your spotter does a great job to help you out
5935419 were really excited about it you know unfortunately we havent had fulltime sponsorship but thats given us the opportunity to have some really cool partners and this is another one lafayette ford and chp california highway patrol were some of my favorites and now the knight rider car its going to be really cool i grew up watching knight rider and i was a fan of kitt its just very cool that i get the opportunity to drive it im looking forward to it its going to be fun and i think theres going to be a lot of excitement around it it should be really cool
5935420 experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow pete doherty and babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy whereas the profile of someone that would follow around cliff richard or bucks fizz for example is completely different

5935428 dalam bahagian kedua ini sumpah sah dilakukan oleh seseorang yang
5935429 perkara yang menjadi objek sumpah pula ialah perkara yang lalu atau
5935430 sumpah seperti ini harus dilakukan jika difikirkan perlu seperti untuk menguatkan percakapan atau kenyataan
5935431 dan ia juga bukan sumpah mubahalah seperti yang terdapat dalam ayat 61 surah al imran kerana mubahalah memerlukan persetujuan pihak kedua
5935432 jika seseorang bersumpah dengan mushaf atau meletakkan tangan ke atasnya atau berkata demi quran ini maka ia adalah sumpah yang sah mengikut pendapat imam syafie hanafi dan hambali
5935433 bersumpah dengan nama allah dengan meletakkan tangan ke atas mushaf adalah sumpah yang sah

5935583 the measure of love is how much it gives and the measure of the love of god is the gift of his one and only son to become human to die for sins and so to be the one mediator who can bring us to god
5935584 this is how god showed his love among us he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins
5935585 access to the president doesnt mean youre going to get the truth
5935586 he never really aspired to be president but lightning struck
5935587 he turned out to be a good president because he really restored confidence in the oval office and a sense of security in the country after watergate
5935588 missed his calling he would have been a great minister
5935589 they reagan advisers james baker ed meese and michael deaver taught him to say this is not a press conference they had him quite trained on that
5935590 at the tail end both he and mrs bush began to think we were the cause of all their troubles so the press was not liked at all
5935591 clinton was denied his legitimacy as president by the ultra right in this country
5935592 he was asked so many personal questions no president has ever been subjected to that kind of tyranny
5935593 theres a blackout now i believe until the end of his term
5935594 helen represents what is necessary to make our democracy function at its highest level journalists asking tough questions of presidents
5935595 its still the only way the public can get the information to make educated choices
5935596 youve got to be a little daring and you might incur some wrath from the powers that be but so what if you dont ask the questions they dont get asked
5935597 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5935598 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5935599 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5935600 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5935601 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5935602 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful

5935611 widespread diaper rash is a fairly new phenomenon that surfaced along with disposable diapers reasons for more rashes include allergies to chemicals lack of air higher temperatures because plastic retains body heat and babies are probably changed less often because they feel dry when wet
5935612 several independent medical studies document an astounding increase in diaper rash from 7 in 1955 to 78 in 1991 critics of disposables say this parallels the increase in usage for disposables
5935613 disposables will hold about 7 lbs of fluid but how long do you want your child in a used diaper a dirty diaper is a dirty diaper and should be changed to prevent bacterial infections
5935614 a number of researchers and pediatricians say responsible sanitary care dictates changes every 2 hours
5935615 diapers lined with plastic raise the temperature of the scrotum far above body temperature and can lead to a total breakdown of normal cooling mechanisms according to the study published in the archives of disease in childhood 6
5935616 okay but still disposables are more convenient we are often willing to pay for convenience right and i can always change them more often to avoid rashes
5935617 the pulp and paper industrys practice of bleaching pulp whiter than white with chlorine produces a large class of chemicals known as organochlorines some extremely persistent and toxic which include the infamous dioxins and furans
5935618 their effects are particularly threatening to the most vulnerable of us all developing infants and children

5935623 a significant portion of the disposable diaper waste dumped in americans landfills every year is actually biodegradable human waste preserved forever 16
5935624 disposable diaper packages contain a request printed on the outside of the package that the inner diapers be rinsed and the fecal material flushed down the toilet before the diapers are put out for curbside collection 14
5935625 it is the soldier not the reporter who has given us the freedom of the press it is the soldier not the poet who has given us the freedom of speech it is the soldier not the campus organizer who gives us the freedom to demonstrate it is the soldier who salutes the flag who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag
5935626 in the absence of orders go find something and kill it
5935627 be without fear in the face of your enemies safegaurd the helpless even if it leads to your death
5935628 so theyve got us surrounded good that simplifies the problem now we can fire in any direction those bastards wont get away this time
5935629 you can discover what your enemy fears most by seeing the tactics he uses to frighten you
5935630 dont live in the past whats done is done just do everything you can to make the future even better
5935631 this is my life and its ending one minute at a time i make that minute count

5935650 i hate to look so far down the road because this is a tricky situation
5935651 its one of those things where it feels really good one day and you come back another day and its sore
5935652 its one of those injuries where you have to really monitor and make sure im not overdoing it
5935653 its asking me for wierd information like your address i think its trying to ask you out on a date
5935654 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments

5935657 drink down that gin and kerosene and come spit on bridges with me
5935658 look away cause im strange in my mind lets make a place for me so i feel right inside
5935659 youre so bitter you think your sweet you hate to lose but dont like to cheat and you like punk rock youre so unique
5935660 i dont ever want to have to see you go cause i dont ever want to have to be alone
5935661 white light white light white light alcohol alcohol alcohol white light
5935662 i wont suffer be broken get tired or wasted surrender to nothing
5935663 welcome home outcasts because i know how you have felt over the years the truth is that looking at me is like looking in the mirror
5935664 so whered you go how was your vacation home well obviously you were busy too busy for me

5935675 if for some reason they drop the ball we can revisit this
5935676 i just feel weve run out of time and the progress weve made is at risk
5935677 i would contend its not just the agency its whether the people in this community really support dealing with the water issue
5935678 this water overdraft problem has been going on for a long time and its getting worse
5935679 water users will not suddenly link arms and sing about seeing the light this action has to be taken
5935680 i feel the community is ready to make a decision on a difficult question
5935681 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
5935682 with this change the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
5935683 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
5935684 there is nothing that allows an agency of the federal government to not obey the endangered species act and the agencies are liable under civil and criminal penalties if they do not obey
5935685 proposed rule is consistent with the fws fish and wildlife service current understanding it is not possible to draw a direct causal link
5935686 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
5935687 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
5935688 this is akin to a drug company suppressing results showing that a medicine is killing people and then trying to put the medicine broadly on the market
5935689 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
5935690 after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

5935705 seit fast f nf jahren ist das unternehmen nun am markt und verzeichnet von jahr zu jahr ein st rkeres wachstum
5935706 this is a pompous badly acted film full of absurd anachronisms and inconsistencies
5935707 it has dwarfs music technicolor freak characters and judy garland it cant be expected to have a sense of humor as well and as for the light touch of fantasy it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet
5935708 the love story that takes us from time to time into the past is horribly wooden and cliches everywhere lower the tension
5935709 the old master has turned out another hitchcock and bull story in which the mystery is not so much who done it as who cares
5935710 the apartment is without style or taste shifting gears between pathos and slapstick without any transition what can you do after all in a big insurance company and where but in hollywod would this situation be seen as comic material to me the apartment illustrated hollywoods lack of contact with reality
5935711 for this is third rate hitchcock a grand guignol drama in which the customers hang around just for the tiny thrill at the end like a strip tease and one feels as one comes out as in both these cases that one has been had bad taste in the mouth i think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind a mean sly sadistic little mind
5935712 a cheap piece of bald faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz age cut ups in thoroughly modern millie this blending of farce with brutal killings is as pointless as it is lacking in taste
5935713 the slab is never explained leaving 2001 for all of its lively visual and mechanical spectacle a kind of space spartacus and more pretentious still a shaggy god story
5935714 there is little justification for this ugly pointless disgustingly bloody film
5935715 don siegels latest film dirty harry is an elegiac necrophiliac fascist love poem
5935716 marred by a greater preponderance of sophomoric overdone and mocking humor
5935717 a simplistic overinflated shocker that reduces potentially interesting themes to banality
5935718 its a frankenstein monster stitched together from leftover parts it talks it moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own looking very expensive but spiritually desperate part ii has the air of a very long very elaborate revue sketch
5935719 like a lot of american film institute efforts the pic has good tech values particularly the inventive sound mixing but little substance or subtlety lynch seems bent on emulating herschell gordon lewis the king of low budget gore
5935720 while much of the footage is breathtaking apocalypse now is emotionally obtuse and intellectually empty it is not so much an epic account of a grueling war as an incongruous extravagant monument to artistic self defeat
5935721 dawn pummels the viewer with a series of evermore grisly events the actors are as woodenly uninteresting as the characters they play romeros script is banal when not incoherent the plot isnt worth detailed description
5935722 comes off as being no better than a mannered version of the amityville horror
5935723 with everything to work with director stanley kubrick has teamed with jumpy jack nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about stephen kings bestseller the crazier nicholson gets the more idiotic he looks shelley duvall tranforms the warm sympathetic wife of the book into a simpering semi retarded hysteric
5935724 arrives as a disappointment of considerable proportions sprawling 32 million saga of jewish gangsters over the decades is surprisingly deficient of clarity and purpose as well as excitement and narrative involvement
5935725 the mission is probably the first film in which de niro gives a bland uninteresting performance the fundamental problem is that the script is cardboard thin pinning labels on its characters and arbitrarily shoving them into various stances to make plot points
5935726 one of the truly great motion pictures of our time
5935727 the most deeply touching love story of our time this is one movie youll never forget
5935728 one of the best films of the year joins the godfather and goodfellas as one of the greatest gangster films ever made

5935928 when you get a guy out there who throws that hard and hes behind in the count as much as hes been since hes been back that puts hitters in real comfortable counts
5935929 this is all well and good but will it work over the internet
5935930 we want to offer them transparency and choice about the options that are available to them
5935931 this is in addition to our existing opt out when yahoo serves customized advertising on third party networks
5935932 we believe this is particularly important since it is not always obvious to all users that ads are served by different entities among web sites
5935933 consistent with the terms of the providers existing customer notices and acceptable use policy which our customers must expressly accept to activate their broadband internet access service
5935934 additional steps to protect our customers privacy including confirming their interest in receiving tailored advertisements and by securing an additional opt in consent from them
5935935 customers shouldnt be required to read complex and confusing legal updates about privacy policy
5935936 the companies really failed to fully disclose all the data collection and targeting they routinely do
5935937 you would never know reading aols letter for example that it acquired behavioral targeting leader tacoda last year
5935938 aols letter to the hill is a fairy tale version of the targeting it can do

5935998 it aims to develop new knowledge about the meanings of medications their safety and risk and the influence of media and social processes in their use and misuse

5936006 for almost half my time on the high court the majority of the members on the court were people whod been appointed by labor governments and when i was appointed in 1998 they were in a majority and remained in a majority until 2003
5936007 i dont ever recall hearing anybody suggest that there was some change in the direction of the court in 2003 but it was not until 2003 that the court in recent times had a majority of members who were appointed by a coalition government

5936012 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5936013 if the stocks drop i expect crude prices to rise but it will be within the 118 120 a barrel range if the stocks increase or are flat i expect prices to be around the 112 113 a barrel level
5936014 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel

5936026 all dogs are special but levi was truly extraordinary as he overcame his probable abuse from humans with sticks and poles and gunshots
5936027 will help to heal many broken hearts at grrnt and adot in addition to his human partner who is also mourning his loss
5936028 as you can see he was also a very handsome dog
5936029 golden retriever rescue of north texas grrnt recently learned of the accidental death of one of our grrnt golden heroes levi grrnt name stetson who became a service assistance dog with assistance dogs of texas
5936030 the mission of assistance dogs of texas adot is to provide assistance dogs obtained through shelters and rescue groups to children and adults with disabilities for increased independence
5936031 friends for animals shelter near granbury before contacting grrnt had pulled levi from the hood county shelter as a stray on the very day he was scheduled for euthanasia
5936032 after vetting by a grrnt rescue veterinarian levi was placed in foster care with mike and barb justice active grrnt volunteers and fosters
5936033 sadly they also began to suspect he had been abused when they noticed he was fearful of sticks or poles as if his previous owner had struck him
5936034 while in foster care levi attended several grrnt events and demonstrated exceptional sensitivity to children and people in wheelchairs
5936035 cindy roberts director of training for adot and ginny mitchell an adot trainer tested levi at the justice home
5936036 levi was accepted into the adot program the same day he was tested and mary ellen jones became his trainer and foster
5936037 during his training period with adot a growth was discovered under levis beautiful red fur
5936038 levi also became a golden star at church physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities and at the elementary school where his partner volunteered
5936039 i came in the new guy everything was set they had their pass rushers they were happy with they had everything flowing for them so i was just kind of the odd man out
5936040 last year when he came his hands were all over the place
5936041 hes done a real good job of taking care of that problem hes definitely more explosive this year
5936042 i played defensive end in college so thats what i truly love rushing the passer
5936043 he had a pretty good first game and he understands hes a particular style of player and he has his strengths hes not a big bulky guy but hes fast and hes strong
5936044 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5936045 its just going to be about knocking the rust off and get going i dont think it will take that long at all like riding a bike
5936046 you know how it is when you have to play you have to play
5936047 i told the trainers you are going to have to get me anti anxiety medication
5936048 i spent all offseason rehabbing both shoulders and the thumb and then my back gets hurt good night
5936049 just starting these two preseason games was huge for me i thought i did well
5936050 this is going to sound weird but i like his mind set the most
5936051 he has a very open mind to learning hes very intelligent and thats something that is rarely talked about with pass rushers in this league
5936052 were looking for him to do even more he did some good natural things in the pass rush but now we want to see him sack the passer things like that
5936053 but hes come a long ways he really has now weve got to give him the opportunity to raise his level of production
5936054 while not all cases require this level of expediency the bce appeal shows that our court system can respond to the needs of litigants for efficient resolution of disputes
5936055 the average appeal in the supreme court takes approximately 18 months from the filing of the leave application to the rendering of the decision on appeal in the case of the bce appeal this time was compressed to one month
5936056 i have never before seen the supreme court act with anything approaching the speed of the bce appeal
5936057 there is no question that all of the superior courts and courts of appeal are well aware that their reputation in the business world is not good in terms of speed
5936058 there is a reasonable basis for that concern because litigation does take years
5936059 the court has largely been on the periphery of bay streets radar but became its focus overnight with the bce case
5936060 in that context claims of unresponsiveness tend to be overblown
5936061 however while the complaint was overblown the courts docket has shifted to include more business disputes in areas such as corporate commercial law pensions tax class actions and intellectual property
5936062 different athletes are saying things and a lot of them we dont have relationships with
5936063 it is a strategic placement on mcdonalds part to offer it to the athletes at their doorstep and the spill off that comes is a bonus
5936064 what did i eat a better question might be what didnt i eat i had my usual big mac
5936065 looking at the games so far mcdonalds clearly has a product placement strategy
5936066 if you show an implied endorsement such as bolt talking about chicken mcnuggets thats golden
5936067 some people will tell you its worth millions of dollars
5936068 yes lego has star wars and indiana jones but looking at retailer shelf space allocation going into the fall season were having excellent success
5936069 we think its a great magical play pattern theres a very high rate of consumer interest
5936070 i think it was relatively easy for mega brands to steal some of our market share in the past going forward thats going to be a lot more difficult
5936071 we got a wake up call we had become a little bit slow moving after 50 years of success
5936072 the opportunity for any company to come in and take away from our share now is much more difficult than 10 years ago those days are gone
5936073 the companies that are weathering these difficult times the best are those with consumer driven brands
5936074 mega brands biggest opportunity is to really start nurturing a more consumer oriented brand that can give them more insulation in times of trouble and also more leverage with retailers who have a lot more power these days

5936081 back when ibm was at its peak it leased mainframes and was virtually recession proof cloud computing in its absolute sense isnt computers you purchase for your own cloud but services you subscribe to for your organization which can be increased or decreased based on need
5936082 i miss willow and last night i curled up with my lucky a rescued weimaraner and said a prayer for her soul
5936083 this poor dog could not walk and could barely stand but did wag her tail a bit
5936084 she weighed in at not quite 30 lbs should have weighed twice that much and was skin and bones
5936085 so she was given sub q fluids and i was called
5936086 we named her willow because the branches of a willow tree will bend but rarely break and she had been bent a lot in her short life but was still affectionate with us
5936087 it was obvious that she had been abused as she would cower and crawl to you at first but did soak up all the attention we lavished on her
5936088 we did find a couple of old scars on her and most likely she wasnt mean enough for whoever shot her mate and left her to die on that county road all alone
5936089 we think that maybe she was just trying to please us when she went after the other dog
5936090 i know that sounds crazy but probably the only praise she had gotten before was if she attacked another animal
5936091 this is not the way it was supposed to happen she was supposed to get another chance at life
5936092 it just makes me sick to my stomach that someone could do what they did to her
5936093 she and i shared many kisses and whispers of love and hope over the last week
5936094 it is difficult not to rant and rave about how unfair it is how some people just suck plain and simple
5936095 i hope she knew that most people are good and that she got the raw end of a bad deal i wish i could get a hold of whoever did this to her with my own brand of justice but that wont bring her back or undo the damage done to her in her short life
5936096 she was here she was loved she mattered and she will be missed
5936097 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5936098 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5936099 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5936100 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5936101 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5936102 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5936103 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5936104 next time dont even bother asking i like everything supersized
5936105 i wanted to let you know that i lost my peeper this past saturday at the age of 18 years 7 months he was truly my baby since i took him to foster when he was just 4 weeks old
5936106 he struggled with asthma and severe breathing problems his entire life and i feel incredibly blessed to have had him for so very long
5936107 if youd care to read it id like to share peepers story with you
5936108 peepers story actually begins with a mama cat i found in 1989 during the august pledge drive at channel 13
5936109 despite her best efforts and mine the baby died on a saturday 9 days later
5936110 at operation kindness that afternoon i took a phone call from a woman who had found a 4 week old kitten in her backyard
5936111 she came in a short time later with a tiny bit of fluff in a shoebox the little thing was pathetic looking thin and with eyes glued shut with matter
5936112 the baby was indeed blind in one eye and had scar tissue on the other eye
5936113 his breathing was more of a wheeze and his meow was more of a chirp or peep like a bird
5936114 peeper was the bravest most fearless cat ive ever seen brave because he struggled for so long with his labored breathing and for the past few years with cornea problems that i know caused him much discomfort
5936115 he endured more tests than i can count 3 kinds of eye drops and 4 pills a day without complaining rare for a cat
5936116 and he was fearless not afraid of dogs or new feline additions to the family not afraid to jump to the top of the shower stall and balance on the 2
5936117 he was also one of the most loving cats ive ever had
5936118 peeper leaves a tremendous void in my heart and in my home
5936119 im thankful every day that i was the one who picked up the phone at operation kindness back on august 19 1989
5936120 i feel so bad for them i can just picture this hulk of a man breaking down in tears sugar went to work with him sat on his desk went in the car he couldnt even tell me for the first few minutes on the phone but i knew
5936121 had to leave her at the shelter because she herself was being placed in a nursing home
5936122 it broke my heart so off to cedar hill i went
5936123 i remember her being so scared and confused wondering why she was no longer safe at home
5936124 sugar came to live with us and settled in quickly
5936125 the gentleman inquiring about her wanted a dog he could take to work with him
5936126 it will always be one of my most memorable home visits
5936127 when i went back in a week to finalize the adoption her new family was so excited
5936128 over the years ive received updates and new pictures so i knew she was still happy and loved
5936129 the loss in keiths voice was overwhelming when he told me
5936130 while my heart breaks for keith and sherri i am so very thankful that sugar found her way to them
5936131 i am not only representing myself i have a responsibility to fight for my country
5936132 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down li said
5936133 it shows the dream of chinese sportsmen for generations and also the common aspirations of 1 3 billion chinese people
5936134 otaku the nickname given to the chinese couch potatoes glued to olympic tv coverage
5936135 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
5936136 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
5936137 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
5936138 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
5936139 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team
5936140 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
5936141 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said
5936142 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
5936143 cyber cafes have become very cheap but if we have a cheap laptop then it becomes easy for us to continue working in the comfort of our home into the night
5936144 we are competing with students and teachers abroad so we have to equip students with the necessary material
5936145 once they all line up at this level its anyones medal
5936146 i hit hurdles eight and nine and gave away a lot of ground
5936147 i have the medal and im holding it but its so surreal
5936148 its a blessing its going to hit me in the morning and im going to cry
5936149 she would sit down and talk to our track club and say you can go after your dreams
5936150 the point simply is that you had a certain set of wrong policies which culminated into a situation where the whole movement which started for a separate status in 1950 its journey has been towards separatism but i think even today any country worth its salt is going to allow its territory to be compromised with and india shall not under any circumstances compromise with its territory
5936151 this is an unexpected situation we have been very faithful in the peace process and we hold the supremacy of the peace process we are very saddened by this situation and we hope we are still optimistic that everybody will cooperate and save the situation and the peace process
5936152 there were so many delays in the negotiations there has been actuations by the grp that they were trying to renege on what had been agreed on already
5936153 there is no chance of a peaceful settlement in the conflict
5936154 we are trying our best to restrain our commanders in order to save the situation
5936155 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5936156 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5936157 with our production house doing well as an actor i dont have to be desperate im not so ambitious as to put my whole and soul into an acting career i can do solo hero films but id rather be part of bigger projects with salmanbhai that will have a smooth sailing release as a producer i know which projects will make it smoothly
5936158 yash tonk was originally doing my role he even shot for four days then he got busy with his television work
5936159 yash is a friend we did fight club together it was an awkward situation for him he called me up and requested me to get into his shoes since it was salman bhais film i didnt think twice
5936160 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
5936161 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
5936162 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
5936163 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus

5936180 ik verkoop meer sportfietsen van 2 000 euro dan van 1 000 euro
5936181 bij ons is de stijging volledig te wijten aan het toenemende succes van de elektrische fietsen
5936182 de vraag naar deze modellen is zo groot dat de productie maar amper kan volgen
5936183 mijn oudoom is nooit getrouwd en ook zijn broer en zus hadden geen kinderen
5936184 maar via mijn ouders hebben we altijd veel contact met hem gehad begin juni was hij er nog bij op de bruiloft van mijn dochter en in april vierden we uitgebreid zijn tachtigste verjaardag
5936185 nonkel raoul was een liefhebber van franse wijn en ging elke zomer zes zeven weken op reis naar frankrijk normaal gezien kregen we altijd een kaartje maar we hadden vreemd genoeg nog niks ontvangen dit jaar
5936186 de twee zijn vroeger nog samen door frankrijk getrokken en bezochten daar dan altijd een gravin met wie ze bevriend waren blijkbaar had de politie haar adres in de auto gevonden en haar gecontacteerd maar toen het bericht van zijn overlijden ons bereikte was hij dus al begraven
5936187 toen we het nieuws hoorden hebben we onmiddellijk besloten hem naar hier te laten overbrengen maar we hebben wel eerst 2000 euro moeten betalen voor de begrafenis die ginder had plaatsgevonden en voor de kosten van de opgraving uiteindelijk hebben we hem hier een anderhalve maand later de uitvaart kunnen geven die hij verdiende er waren wel driehonderd mensen aanwezig
5936188 we hadden ergens wel gehoopt dat de stad sint niklaas in de kosten zou tussenkomen omdat daar toch wel een serieuze flater is begaan maar uiteindelijk hebben we zelfs geen verontschuldigingen gekregen
5936189 in die fax stond niet dat die man dood was
5936190 onze medewerkers hebben gewoon een antwoord gegeven op de vraag van buitenlandse zaken bz of er directe nabestaanden waren dat bleek niet het geval in onze registers maar in de fax van bz stond ook nergens dat de man dood was laat staan in frankrijk zou begraven worden
5936191 zoiets is nog nooit gebeurd het is waar dat er niet verder naar nabestaanden is gezocht op onze diensten maar ook zonder nabestaanden werden mensen in het verleden altijd gerepatrieerd naar belgi waarom bz daar nu anders over beslist heeft is mij een raadsel
5936192 het is de allereerste keer dat ik hoor dat een landgenoot bij overlijden in het buitenland wordt begraven tenzij hij zelf uitdrukkelijk die wens te kennen heeft gegeven
5936193 die ambtenaar heeft er zich wellicht makkelijk van af gemaakt in de veronderstelling dat niemand aan die nietrepatri ring zou tillen
5936194 bijna alle belgen hebben via hun mutualiteit een aanvullende verzekering medische bijstand in het buitenland die een volledige of gedeeltelijke terugbetaling van een lijkrepatri ring dekt
5936195 een zebra is een wild dier maar zorro heeft zijn rol perfect gespeeld
5936196 we zijn eerst met de opnameploeg naar een voetbalveld in bocholt getrokken om hem te laten wennen aan de situatie
5936197 we hadden een veearts klaar staan met een verdovend geweer en er waren nadarhekken we hadden ook onzichtbare nylondraden gespannen zodat de zebra daar binnen bleef en we lieten de zebra op het juiste pad lopen door hem met snoep en voer te lokken
5936198 veel mensen vergeten dat een zebra een wild dier is
5936199 er is nog nooit een film gemaakt waarbij een zebra op wandel gaat door een drukke stad

5936208 toen sapphire in 1995 werd geboren was ik wat kleine klusjes aan het uitvoeren rond het huis ik wist dat de geboorte voor elk moment was
5936209 plots kwam mijn dochtertje hard aangefietst en riep dat het zo ver was ik sprong op de fiets van de kleine en reed meteen naar de stal het veulen hing er al half uit samen met gerda heb ik haar op de wereld geholpen
5936210 zeker tien centimeter groter dan andere veulens en meteen ook heel gespierd ze stond daar met een houding van hier ben ik en ik ben er klaar voor wat meteen in het oog sprong was de tekening ter hoogte van haar bles een witte pijl die naar boven wijst alsof het wou zeggen springen daar ben ik erg goed in
5936211 haar vader is darco een monument in de paardenwereld en de moeder is idjaz c
5936212 toen ze amper drie was sprong ze hier thuis al over een hek van twee meter hoog alsof het niets was die kracht en die souplesse het is wonderbaarlijk en dan moet je weten dat ze zelf nog twee veulens heeft gebaard voor ze in de topsport terecht is gekomen
5936213 it is always good to go out of these kinds of matches with a win i am happy physically because i am fine coming out of this match
5936214 i am definitely thinking the body is not holding as well as it used to
5936215 thats a fact and it is pretty frustrating but that is the way it is
5936216 it is good to have matches before a grand slam
5936217 i needed to return better and i didnt i didnt make enough serves when i needed
5936218 we both felt we couldve done a couple of things better
5936219 we tried to enjoy it and not take things seriously
5936220 but all i can do is pitch the way i know i can pitch weve been really struggling weve been trying too hard
5936221 ive been trying too hard i tried too hard tonight i made some good pitches at times but they hit some of them
5936222 we need to relax a bit this was supposed to be a good season for us but everything has gone wrong
5936223 we need to stay together as a team and win some games
5936224 its not the kind of double play you see very often
5936225 you can focus on us not getting the runners home thats fair
5936226 but now at least were hitting the ball and were getting runners on base before we werent doing that if we continue to get guys on base well eventually break through and get them home
5936227 its such a sad thing its the olympics and youre out there to win but you dont want to see anybody get hurt
5936228 if you have a collision at home plate you never come up and try to hit the guy in the chest
5936229 i felt it was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected him at that point after that the game got out of hand
5936230 when i first got here everybody told me what a great bunter he was
5936231 they thought he could get a lot of hits off the bunt if he wanted to but for two thirds of the season we didnt see him do it
5936232 what i think is that there is a rhythm to bunting and it may have been that he was afraid to give away at bats but he let the scouting reports get out that he doesnt bunt and now that he is theyre not quite ready for it
5936233 its a pretty good time for the island right now
5936234 everybodys excited about the little league team which has been good for eight or nine years

5936248 international law is 100 on the side of cyprus that is why turkey refused to go to court
5936249 turkey believes international law is 100 on it side thats why it took the particular intervention actions that it did and that is why there is no need to go to court
5936250 our view is well known the presence of the turkish occupational forces and the turkish invasion cannot be legally based on the treaty of guarantee and their presence in cyprus is in any case illegal
5936251 international law is 100 on the side of cyprus that is why
5936252 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace

5936260 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
5936261 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
5936262 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
5936263 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere you could also have drier air these are far more critical factors than the ocean being warmer
5936264 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
5936265 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
5936266 we did it because we came to china we dont want to do anything bad for chinese people or asian people

5936283 anak anak sekarang sudah sangat berbeda dengan anak anak tahun 80 an sekarang anak anak sudah bisa berpikir dan lebih pintar memilih apa yang mereka inginkan
5936284 kadang kadang anak ingin memasuki sebuah sekolah karena anjuran dari teman teman sepermainannya bahkan ada pula yang ikut ikutan itu yang harus diwaspadai
5936285 kalau kasusnya sudah demikian ada baiknya orangtua memberikan teguran agak keras pada anak anaknya karena sekolah yang dipilih berdasarkan ikut ikutan akan membuat anak lebih banyak bermain dari pada belajar nantinya
5936286 kalau saya menyarankan lebih baik anak anak bertemu teman teman baru daripada membuat sebuah grup namun dengan teman teman yang telah mereka kenal karena mereka akan bercanda terus

5936291 the hummer is way too expensive for the chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase especially with oil prices running near an all time high
5936292 unless someone is going to acquire it for military use i just dont see it being a viable product line
5936293 then again if you do a complete overhaul you would take hummer away from what defines it and makes it the brand that it is

5936302 the drinking to excess that i witness here doesnt happen there
5936303 once you outlaw something it makes people want to do it more
5936304 but we recognize the initiative is raising an important and controversial issue
5936305 we are studying it and we have groups on campus studying it
5936306 i dont see the logic of saying we have a significant underage drinking problem lets lower it even more
5936307 we have to be responsible and being responsible is understanding the law behind it

5936309 women did not create the glass ceiling the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what theyre worth but they help maintain it
5936310 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
5936311 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts
5936312 good work is important but good work alone does not as the myth says speak for itself you have to give it a voice
5936313 this led many women in the study to actually prefer male managers to female managers claiming men are more consistent and fair minded than women

5936317 dude i found my cat in the car once with his four inch tapeworm buddy hanging out of his mouth
5936318 there nestled in a bed of white black and purple yes purple mold was the plastic tupperware container lid popped open from the heat and this black tar ish barf like substance that when turned upside down did not even make a run for the ground
5936319 when the used car manager inquired about the smell i told him than the girls grandfather had died in the car and we needed to trade it in because the trauma made it impossible for the kids to ever ride in it again he took pity on me and gave me 500 over book for the trade
5936320 stray dog vomit piles of it in the loopy carpet found on the back of my folded down car back seat after said stray dog has apparently eaten a jed clampett sized bowl of cheap cat food and are those ramen noodles oh shit unless dr frankenstein has used his talents to animate pasta those are tapeworms omfg the mass of orange slime covered goo was positively seething with live and dead intestinal parasites
5936321 partially digested warm cat food turned to dog puke full of worms on a hot day
5936322 and threatening that americans 43 killed in algerian police school attack
5936323 they had 200 plus guys all shooting at us i mean pure chaos
5936324 i yelled to him i was like phillips man i need help im hit i looked at him and i called him about four or five times i was like phillips phillips are you all right phillips and he never moved
5936325 thats the first one of my buddies ive ever seen die
5936326 i thought that was completely amazing he never i mean he finally was killed by rocket propelled grenades and gunfire but he never once stopped shooting back at them
5936327 they knew our guys were in trouble and when the airbornes in trouble you dont leave them to die you go help them
5936328 its like one of the those movies out of like vietnam that you see with all these special effects and everythings on fire
5936329 smoke in the air and thats all you see is tracer rounds going back and forth
5936330 the noise of the mortars that whistling noise the a 10 warplanes and the apache helicopters sent in to support us its just like you see and hear in the movies
5936331 ever since basic training bill hewitt has been one of my best friends and he makes me appreciate the army
5936332 how could i sit back on the sidelines and watch the war on the news while all these young men my age were out there fighting
5936333 i had to do something to help thats why i joined
5936334 everyone fought bravely like true soldiers training and instinct took over as we fought for the man on our left and the man on our right
5936335 these guys fought for 15 months and i mean this literally they have fought harder and had more engagements more direct fire engagements than any brigade in the united states army in probably the toughest terrain
5936336 they are absolutely veterans and they know what theyre doing and they have that airborne spirit and they fought a very very tough battle and held the ground and did everything they were supposed to do
5936337 ive no regrets no one cowered from their duties and everyone fought hard
5936338 we were just going to work and we had a job to do
5936339 it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statues
5936340 there was a time when i struggled with what appeared to be the senslessness of it all but the reality of the goodness of god and then the experience of the work of god in lives through jeremys suffering have resonated with the truths of scripture it is real this is what the world needs to see a real god transforming real lives in the most intense of situations
5936341 where were you when i laid the foundation of the earth
5936342 have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place
5936343 as i see it jeremy has been full time in the ministry for the last fourteen years it was not the ministry he would have chosen or any of us would have chosen for him but he gave up the right to choose how god would use him sometime along the way and i know he wanted what god wanted for him he is a great example for all of us
5936344 i want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel
5936345 the deepest moments of spiritual fellowship with the living christ are at times of intense suffering suffering drives believers to him they find in him a merciful high priest a faithful friend who feels their pain and a sympathetic companion who faced all the trials and temptations that they face heb 4 15 he is thus uniquely qualified to help them in their weaknesses and infirmities
5936346 do the janzes fear god for nothing do those who know and love this boy simply believe in a feel good god
5936347 god is the highest good of the reasonable creature and the enjoyment of him is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied to go to heaven fully to enjoy god is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations here fathers and mothers husbands wives children or the company of earthly friends are but shadows but the enjoyment of god is the substance these are but scattered beams but god is the sun these are but streams but god is the fountain these are but drops but god is the ocean therefore it becomes us to spend this life only as a journey towards heaven as it becomes us to make the seeking of our highest end and proper good the whole work of our lives to which we should subordinate all other concerns of life why should we labor for or set our hearts on anything else but that which is our proper end and true happiness
5936348 the afflicted shall eat and be satisfied those who seek him shall praise the lord may your hearts live forever

5936357 gimana mau berlama lama ngobrol dengan dia lha ngobrol dengan dia kayak sedang ngobrol di hutan suaranya melengking banget apalagi kalau sudah tertawa bikin sakit telinga kalau enggak di depan umum sih enggak masalah tapi kalau kebetulan sedang di tempat umum misalnya di resto bikin malu pernah dia tertawa ngakak di resto spontan semua orang menengok ke arah kami saya hanya bisa cengar cengir saja kayak orang tolol

5936367 there comes a time in our lives when we transition from childhood to adulthood and once we make that transition we are faced with two paths one path is a path in which freedom and security are provided by the blood sweat and tears of others the second is a world in which we make a stand and say follow me for i will protect you from those who mean you harm it takes a special person to choose the second path and most shy away lieutenant girdano spc mulvihill pfc badie and pvt garcia not only accepted a challenge but they embraced it

5936369 i asked him how he felt about going to afghanistan and he said to me that even though he was a little nervous that he was ready and willing to go do his job wherever he was needed he also explained to me that his siblings were in the military and he was proud to be doing what he was doing
5936370 he showed genuine care and concern for those around him
5936371 you will be missed we will cherish the friendship you have put a special mark in our hearts all those who knew him will never forget him the platoon will never be the same without him

5936373 he was the kind of person who knew how to brighten your bad day if you knew jair garcia like his close friends did you knew his pride and joy was his 9 year old son garcia instilled in his friends that when things go wrong you shouldnt go wrong with them he was an older guy who had a lot of wisdom about things and became a role model for many of us jair garcia is now in a place where the grass is greener and at rest he will be missed by many and missed by all

5936379 el resultado que se presenta al mes de julio nos confirma que una de las fortalezas del pa s es su situaci n fiscal tal y como lo han reconocido las principales calificadoras de riesgo internacional en las ltimas semanas por lo que debemos continuar con el manejo prudente de la hacienda p blica para garantizar el financiamiento de los programas sociales y la inversi n p blica
5936380 esto debe ser tratado de forma oficial no por comunicados de prensa
5936381 chevron parece ser que se abre a otras posibles soluciones porque cuando uno mira sus pruebas y defensas no hay mucho para apoyarse
5936382 solamente depende de los venezolanos que el comunismo que pareciera haber llegado haya llegado para quedarse o no
5936383 masivamente tendremos que salir todos los venezolanos a fijar nuestra posici n
5936384 esta ley incrementa la intervenci n centralizada y la consecuencia directa de ello es un menor nivel de seguridad alimentaria para la poblaci n por eso creemos fundamental que podamos todos los sectores discutir estos temas porque la meta com n es incrementar la seguridad alimentaria
5936385 se limita la libertad econ mica y se crean m rgenes de discrecionalidad
5936386 esto es para el pueblo para proteger al pueblo de los afanes de la oligarqu a capitalista y financiera
5936387 were using about half of our reserves to balance this budget
5936388 when we continue to use our reserves to balance our budget somewhere along the lines we will have to pay
5936389 i have had it with these motherfuckin snakes on this motherfuckin plane
5936390 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
5936391 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5936392 were hopeful for the first game but its going to be close
5936393 its not an acl its not an operation its just rest
5936394 he came out of athens as an american sports hero and hes coming out of these games a global sports icon
5936395 we plan to expand michaels presence in other parts around the world
5936396 this is going to sound weird but i like his mind set the most
5936397 he has a very open mind to learning hes very intelligent and thats something that is rarely talked about with pass rushers in this league
5936398 were looking for him to do even more he did some good natural things in the pass rush but now we want to see him sack the passer things like that
5936399 but hes come a long ways he really has now weve got to give him the opportunity to raise his level of production
5936400 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5936401 its just going to be about knocking the rust off and get going i dont think it will take that long at all like riding a bike
5936402 you know how it is when you have to play you have to play
5936403 i told the trainers you are going to have to get me anti anxiety medication
5936404 i spent all offseason rehabbing both shoulders and the thumb and then my back gets hurt good night
5936405 just starting these two preseason games was huge for me i thought i did well
5936406 uh oh i knew i shouldnt put my lips on that
5936407 damn i knew that drain hole was a little too small now what am i gonna do
5936408 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
5936409 i can say to you that my words that i give you are yours to feel to keep and to be loved by i hope that this blog helps create the warmth i feel within me
5936410 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5936411 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5936412 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5936413 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5936414 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5936415 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5936416 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5936417 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5936418 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5936419 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5936420 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5936421 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5936422 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign

5936436 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5936437 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5936438 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5936439 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5936440 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5936441 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5936442 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5936443 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5936444 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5936445 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5936446 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5936447 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5936448 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5936449 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5936450 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5936451 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5936459 i will not in the next term of government allow gm crops to be grown on a commercial basis in western australia
5936460 i find it unbelievable and unacceptable that the national food regulator relies principally on the say so of the gm companies when assessing gm foods as safe to eat
5936461 wa consumers want and deserve to know what they are feeding their families and they expect foods containing gm are not only labelled as such but there is monitoring and enforcement of the labelling
5936462 food security is emerging as one of the most important world issues with the potential for our northern agricultural regions to play a vital role in providing high quality food and agricultural commodities to satisfy both local and international food security requirements
5936463 it is therefore it is vital that we start taking the necessary steps to encourage the diversification of agricultural and horticultural production in our state this includes fast tracking the progressive development of the ord beginning with mantinea and the development of the gascoyne region the liberals will also move to fast track several other key areas of agriculture including the sale and upgrade of current livestock saleyards and the planting of gm cotton and limited commercial size trials of gm canola
5936464 the current focus on gmos during the state election campaign is no more than a smokescreen to avoid scrutiny on major policy issues of more immediate priority
5936465 while wafarmers supports the lifting of the current state government moratorium on the commercial release of gmos and will continue to lobby for this outcome we implore the political parties to go further and genuinely address other important issues currently facing the agricultural industry
5936466 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers

5936489 a very normal reaction coming from a president who is facing a big disturbance there in lanao and she wanted her message immediately out and announced
5936490 that presidential announcement being an hour or 30 minutes late can mean a lot on the ground

5936505 my sister suddenly came down with something and it seems really bad so im going to take her to the doctor
5936506 youre so selfless risa chan im surprised that youve not been in a relationship yet
5936507 thats not what i meant i thought that you took your sister to the doctor
5936508 have you got any ideas of what we can do
5936509 youre so silly risa chan how did you get muffin mix on your face
5936510 oh and if youre wondering why i kissed youre nose its because thats the only place where theres a mole on your face

5936516 oh ha ha very funny i took another mouthful of salad
5936517 is there any exhibit in particular you want to see after
5936518 hey see that duck over there the one thats playing by itself in front of all the other penguins it reminds me of you
5936519 well it looks like you when you make a joke and youre the only one who gets it and the mood goes all cold
5936520 but dont worry youre way way prettier than that penguin
5936521 bwahaha y you should h ha have seen your f f face
5936522 shh i told you before that that doesnt matter at the moment
5936523 is there any exhibit in particular you want to see after
5936524 hey see that duck over there the one thats playing by itself in front of all the other penguins it reminds me of you
5936525 well it looks like you when you make a joke and youre the only one who gets it and the mood goes all cold
5936526 but dont worry youre way way prettier than that penguin
5936527 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5936528 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5936529 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5936530 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5936531 obviously our preferred position is that all pools are fenced with isolation fencing from the house and the rest of the grounds
5936532 but at least this amendment to the legislation will mean that at the point of sale all homes will have to be upgraded to the current standard

5936536 sahabat muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah menyampaikan kepada kami ketika turun kewajiban puasa ramadhan terasa memberatkan mereka para sahabat maka barangsiapa yang tidak mampu diperbolehkan meninggalkan puasa dan memberi makan seorang miskin sebagai keringanan bagi mereka kemudian hukum ini dihapus oleh ayat

5936546 jake our companion and family member for almost 14 years died yesterday friday june 6
5936547 he came to us through a newspaper ad offering border collie mix puppies not long after he entered our household and had assumed a size and shape distinctly un collie like we began to seriously doubt this lineage his genetic makeup became a source of lifelong speculation
5936548 jake excelled in all those traits that make dogs into dogs
5936549 there was the occasional odd behavior try to dance across the kitchen floor and he would make himself an obstacle by throwing his body into your two step or waltz cutting in moral objection we were never certain
5936550 in puppyhood he acquired a passion for catching a frisbee this would eventually be his undoing as the last years of his life were spent nursing blown knees and hips with enough prescription pain pills to make keith richards sit down and cry
5936551 he loved with abandon in the unfettered enviable way only dogs can and protected those he loved to sometimes unacceptable social extremes
5936552 when we moved to a house on a wooded lot with no fenced yard jake never wandered much farther than the back door
5936553 its almost better to have lost because its essentially impossible to make law without losing at the trial level so you can seek an appellate courts guidance
5936554 were going to have a pretty unique system in the state of rhode island when all is said and done

5936556 certainly some aspects of the technology are troubling if people are being spied on if these cameras have that ability
5936557 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5936558 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5936571 weve known that there are some issues with the charlieticket but we realized after reading this paper that they were able to clone and counterfeit the charlieticket
5936572 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5936573 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5936574 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5936575 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5936576 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5936577 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5936578 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5936579 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5936580 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5936581 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
5936582 the significant reduction in free care through the health safety net provides further evidence that health care reform is having its intended effect
5936583 we appreciate the efforts of all parties but will need to ensure that we can sustain the effort going forward
5936584 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5936585 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5936586 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5936587 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5936588 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5936589 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5936590 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5936591 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5936592 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5936593 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5936594 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5936595 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5936596 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5936597 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5936598 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5936599 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5936600 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5936601 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5936602 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5936603 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5936604 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5936605 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5936606 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5936607 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5936608 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5936609 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5936610 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5936614 if the government declares an all out war we will also declare an all out war in mindanao

5936618 the rains in july and august dispelled earlier concerns about hot weather in june
5936619 i view the time now in the cranberry industry as one of change and opportunity
5936620 i think thats really what the industry needed a really good crop
5936621 as long as the equation is in our favor i think the price will remain the same
5936622 crudes just getting pulled up by heating oil it was a quick pop and technical triggers may have been hit
5936623 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5936624 venezuela would have to analyze the possibility of a production cut
5936625 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5936626 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5936627 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5936628 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5936629 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5936630 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5936631 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5936632 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5936633 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5936634 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5936635 i like salman sanjay saif akshay way better than these two
5936636 its not about aamir its about the movie my friend

5936638 the town of dartmouth needs a time out for a year no salary increases for one year
5936639 is it fair no its not fair its downright unfair
5936640 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5936641 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5936642 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5936643 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5936644 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5936645 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call

5936647 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm

5936659 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5936660 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5936661 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5936662 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5936663 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5936664 theyll find another fake issue to focus on and then another

5936668 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5936669 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5936670 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5936671 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5936672 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5936673 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5936674 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5936675 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5936676 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5936677 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5936678 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5936679 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5936680 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5936681 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5936682 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5936683 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5936684 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5936685 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5936686 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5936687 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5936688 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5936689 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5936690 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5936691 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5936692 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5936693 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5936694 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
5936695 his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people
5936696 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5936697 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5936698 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5936699 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5936700 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5936701 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5936702 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5936703 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5936704 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5936705 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5936706 pete stanton we were very proud of derrick atkins and i have always said this but no matter what happened out there whether it was last year or this year we were going to be extremely proud of him and we were
5936707 i think that was a viable solution seeing how other cars were already doing that
5936708 this will clearly demarcate where the road is and where you should keep your vehicle for the best safety of the road
5936709 notwithstanding lifting of the voluntary restrictions we continue to urge our customers to use water wisely
5936710 superb leadership mentorship and instructor abilities his at sea experience knowledge and technical expertise led to well trained submarine warriors manning todays complex submarines
5936711 today we made mistakes that we havent made before but we will have the will to win our next match and win the bronze
5936712 i was doing everything not to think about the match i was going online watching tv going to the supermarket
5936713 too thin not nice not nice to hug hug coconut tree better
5936714 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday
5936715 give me a couple of hours and itll probably smack me in the face thats the coolest thing about it we still want the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver were going home with some kind of medal
5936716 but losing the first match ended up helping us out otherwise we would have played brazil to get into the semifinals instead they put us on the top bracket with no brazilian teams we had a pretty easy road to the gold medal match
5936717 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday
5936718 give me a couple of hours and itll probably smack me in the face thats the coolest thing about it we still want the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver were going home with some kind of medal
5936719 but losing the first match ended up helping us out otherwise we would have played brazil to get into the semifinals instead they put us on the top bracket with no brazilian teams we had a pretty easy road to the gold medal match
5936720 this just means we did what we set out to do
5936721 we still have one more match remaining to put the crowning achievement for probably our careers its fantastic to get there but the final goal is to get the gold medal if we dont get that ive still had a great time but ill be disappointed
5936722 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5936723 its one of the tough breaks that a team goes through
5936724 i dont know how many games russia lost in that 2006 tournament but it didnt matter that made beating us their souvenir it didnt even matter to them that they came in second
5936725 they beat us and that was it we knew that but to actually experience it to hear the entire gym including the australian players in the stands cheer for russia to actually experience that is different than knowing it or being aware of it
5936726 we know shes gonna be there you guys know shes gonna be there shes playing for russia now just like the rest of this team that makes her the enemy
5936727 this is a friend of mine but when we step on the court and shes got the russian colors on like the rest of em
5936728 if you play in this country live in this country and you grew up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not patriotic person in my mind
5936729 i dont know how many games russia lost in that 2006 tournament but it didnt matter that made beating us their souvenir it didnt even matter to them that they came in second
5936730 they beat us and that was it we knew that but to actually experience it to hear the entire gym including the australian players in the stands cheer for russia to actually experience that is different than knowing it or being aware of it
5936731 we know shes gonna be there you guys know shes gonna be there shes playing for russia now just like the rest of this team that makes her the enemy
5936732 this is a friend of mine but when we step on the court and shes got the russian colors on like the rest of em
5936733 if you play in this country live in this country and you grew up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not patriotic person in my mind
5936734 to be honest with you when i look over there i see russia on 12 players jerseys
5936735 when the ball goes up were playing russia i dont worry about the names or numbers because this is a chance for us to advance to a gold medal game were two wins away
5936736 what you are seeing is team gb raising their game on the highest stage and that must inspire the country to back the teams as we move forward we must build on it we must build on it immediately

5936744 we are truly looking forward to this partnership with century media i am encouraged that they indeed understand the spirit and integrity of loaded this first ep should shed some light on who we are what we do and how the fuck we do it
5936745 im ready to fight if i wasnt ready to fight i wouldnt be here
5936746 im ready to fight if i wasnt ready to fight i wouldnt be here
5936747 this is a superb picture sharp open minded wised up and cinematically accomplished
5936748 as an anatomy not only of polanskis psyche but also of the legal system he confronted its as baroquely compelling as
5936749 a mesmerizing portrait of the director as acclaimed artist and tortured human being
5936750 the most significant fact of the film is that the prosecutor gunson a straight laced mormon agrees with the defender dalton that justice was not served
5936751 falls short of being a great film because it lacks a certain ambition
5936752 v monos te voy a llevar a otro lugar que s te va a gustar

5936757 if you have ever experienced the crushing effect of young love you owe it to yourself to check out this gem of a dark comedy
5936758 a tightly packed entertainment it explodes through familiar teen transition territory with dark ironies but all the while touches are sentiments
5936759 not everything in the wackness works and there are times when the divergent serious comedic tones clash instead of complementing each other however in spite of its flaws the production gets us to care about the characters and their situations
5936760 both darkly funny and life affirming in an offbeat and offhanded way
5936761 nostalgic for those bad old days the wackness was shot at a time when it actually looked like
5936762 i n 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5936763 the benefits the parent gets for having their children pronounced with autism
5936764 and you sir who just sit on the fence crying like a rooster well one of these days youll wake up youll cackle like a hen and become a homosexual or something because youre not a man to let this happen to your children
5936765 but the problem with the school system the worst place you can find this is in the inner city the black schools
5936766 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
5936767 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
5936768 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5936769 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday
5936770 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
5936771 the australian ambassador telephoned the governor of khammouane province and the office of the lao prime minister and met with other lao authorities to seek further assistance to locate the man
5936772 the australian embassy in bangkok is providing the man with consular assistance including regular visits to him in hospital and the department of foreign affairs and trade in canberra is in communication with the mans family in australia
5936773 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5936774 he probably needs to widen his defensive stance a little more when hes taking ground balls in the game i let him play the game i dont say much during the game
5936775 sometimes hes been doing it a particular way for so long
5936776 he can run he can hit from both sides hes got a little pop although hes more of a line drive hitter
5936777 but for him to be bouncing from place to place in the major leagues toronto cincinnati washington why
5936778 thats why ive tried to talk to him and say man you cant be that way
5936779 hes been great people might say its been attitude but does attitude mean that hes been a bad guy to me he hasnt been a bad guy
5936780 maybe he has to change the way he approaches the game or the way he goes about the game theres a key somewhere for him and hopefully were the key
5936781 when you line up deep your depth can help you out so much
5936782 you dont have to engage with the linemen because youre so far away from them when youre coming down instead youre reading the running back
5936783 theres nothing like experience if youve got good athletes and competitive people and were fortunate that we have that theyre the vocal leaders of the defense and theyre doing a great job
5936784 we kind of had to walk them through it a little bit last year and now they know it
5936785 once they know our scheme now you can expand your scheme more and do different things were introducing new ideas now that we might want to pull from our menu during the course of the year
5936786 it really allows you to do more advanced things early
5936787 last year it was a learning process coach eberflus couldnt really do everything he wanted to do but now with us having the experience that we have coach e can go into his arsenal right now
5936788 as far as getting guys set up its kind of second nature now
5936789 you dont think about where everybody is supposed to be your brain is churning pretty quickly
5936790 weve been together so long that you know what the person next to you is capable of that lets us know our teammates can get their jobs done so we can do ours worry free
5936791 were the type of guys that if somebody sees it either you can fix it or you can keep making that same mistake and the coaches are going to pull you out
5936792 i see them being able to react and being able to play fast
5936793 were going to try and do a lot of things with him but well do some of the same stuff weve done in the past
5936794 i can tell a difference a big difference when i watch the film
5936795 id like to say this is the most experience weve had in a long while
5936796 we have the athleticism and the experience to be one of the best groups in the big 12 so now weve got to go show we can do it
5936797 if they told me that im starting tomorrow id feel ready except for that i just threw a side im ready to face hitters in the big leagues i know i can get guys out now
5936798 its frustrating to know im ready to pitch and i dont have a role
5936799 but theyll let me know as soon as they can theres nothing theyre doing to me personally its the way it is they have to decide how they want to use me here
5936800 but theres enough separation that i think youve got to do whats best for adam and our club right now and then get carp ready as soon as we can and see where we are
5936801 im sure ill do at least what i did today probably a little more
5936802 im keeping my fingers crossed that carpenter gets back in there sooner rather than later
5936803 it started off like i wanted to but i obviously didnt get to finish it like i wanted
5936804 i can still have that good end to the year i know i can help this team win i just dont know which role yet
5936805 i would probably prefer it if he had said he would come back however we needed him
5936806 i know he wants to be a starter hes worked to be a starter all year long hes having a terrific season as a starter but i know hell do whatever we need
5936807 once i got healthy enough i just jumped in with them
5936808 it just brought back that zest and that love for the game seeing these guys made me remember how i came in wide eyed not knowing what to expect and just working my butt off
5936809 thinking they could really beat me in the 40s and the 20 yard shuttles and things like that
5936810 i got with those guys and it just made it fun again
5936811 a lot of greens a lot of fish a lot of water intake
5936812 id rather have a sub sandwich instead of fast food and in the evening i would have my girl i have a girlfriend now cook for me more baked chicken asparagus
5936813 that was the other thing that made all the difference
5936814 because i felt like at times last year no matter how hard i worked no matter what i did i knew i wasnt going to get on the field at wide receiver the offense wasnt suited for me they had ike isaac bruce and torry holt they had just brought in drew bennett
5936815 i knew al was the kind of guy that hes going to put the best players on the field
5936816 hes not concerned with the contract hes concerned with what you show him on the field
5936817 i learned a long time ago from don coryell dont ask players to do what they cant do
5936818 find out what they can do and then put em in a position so they can do it theres certain things that dante does extremely well having a familiarity with him i think theres an advantage that way
5936819 he probably has had one of the best training camps and spring workouts of anybody on the squad
5936820 i see him how he was two or three years ago when he had that change of direction and acceleration and he was enthusiastic about the game and enjoying himself
5936821 when hes right he can be very special at what he does i think hes improved his skills as a wide receiver hes catching the ball very very well its documented what he can do running the football once he gets the ball in his hands the good lord blessed him with a great deal of ability in space
5936822 i dont even care if im blocking i told saunders its not even about the balls just let me get in the flow it makes all the difference in the world youll see
5936823 it is my divine right as heir to the throne of norway to marry who i like you yourself married a commoner is a penguin really so different father
5936824 its easy to get overlooked here because we have so much talent
5936825 a lot of guys on the line are capable of getting 10 sacks
5936826 were going to have some guys that can rush the passer and some guys that can come off the ball
5936827 you want to be able to put your four best linemen out there and we have a lot of depth at the defensive end position
5936828 the possibilities could be endless as long as we play how were supposed to play
5936829 i think we could be one of the best defensive lines in the nation
5936830 we feel we have guys who can rotate in there its critical when you play teams that spread you out and go quickly that you can stay fresh
5936831 he has big play ability and i think this year hell really come out with it
5936832 just basically dominate and change the game when we get in and make ourselves known
5936833 the goal is always to dominate as much as we can and change the mentality of the offense
5936834 i played next to a few different guys last year
5936835 its always frustrating when you dont have the people you start the season with
5936836 but thats what the depth chart is for people come in step up take over we tried not to miss a beat
5936837 hes been really having a very good camp for us and has played pretty well the last couple of games
5936838 if he can continue to do that and do it every practice and every week then weve got something
5936839 i still have some tightness but im working at it every day trying to stretch it out and get it loose

5936893 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5936894 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5936895 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5936896 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5936897 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5936898 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5936899 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5936900 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5936901 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5936902 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5936903 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5936904 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5936905 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5936906 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5936907 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5936908 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5936909 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5936910 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5936911 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5936912 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5936913 le premier point de cette love affair la rencontre trouver un bon client quelquun avec qui vous aurez du plaisir travailler et quelquun dont vous pensez tirer un int r t de la relation apr s tout cest ce que des gens peuvent dune mani re g n rale sapporter mutuellement un changement une meilleure vie chacun doit s duire lautre le deuxi me point la r putation des deux partenaires les deux partenaires doivent tre compatibles et pouvoir saccorder moi en tant que marketer jai besoin de conna tre les produits que vous avez d j faits comment vous les avez faits comment vous avez trait les autres consultants avec lesquels vous avez d j travaill et je dois vous dire combien je suis bonne dans ma sp cialit vous devez tre impressionn par mes r sultats et peut tre alors aurons nous une histoire damour ensemble le troisi me point que peut on dire du premier moment de la rencontre le premier contact pr figure toute la suite de la relation dabord bien se conna tre lun lautre se faire confiance d velopper une relation o lon peut changer facilement cest vraiment une histoire damour bien s r vous devez faire confiance comprendre sentir le d sir de lautre parce que vous devrez satisfaire ce d sir le 4 me point faut il contractualiser la relation oui oui tout comme un contrat de mariage vous devez d finir le p rim tre et le type de relation qui va s tablir cette relation est elle one shot pour une seule nuit ou au contraire quelque chose qui se construira et durera plus longtemps il faut se mettre daccord sur ce que nous allons cr er ensemble lapog e de la rencontre sera donc le mariage on se met daccord pour faire quelque chose ensemble pour cr er une entit plus grande que les deux individualit s le cinqui me point cr er quelque chose ensemble cest comme concevoir un enfant lenfant sera notre produit commun oui un enfant quil faudra lever duquer qui il faudra faire une place dans la soci t qui il faudra apprendre les valeurs et sassurer que cet enfant aura tout ce dont il aura besoin pour r ussir le sixi me point le divorce il peut arriver quelques fois quand on ne saime plus oui cest bien s r triste tr s triste chacun conna t les secrets de lautre et il faut faire tout son possible pour ne pas arriver une s paration dun point de vue marketing ronne sugg re de renouveler les bases de se souvenir de ce qui nous a attir au d but de la relation revenir aux fondamentaux et la base de la relation analyser ce qui nous a rapproch au d part et regarder si lon peut continuer ou red finir les bases dun nouveau contrat a ce moment l le contrat sera plus solide car nous nous connaissons depuis longtemps le septi me point quid des nouveaux outils relationnels facebook twitter linkedin dapr s ronne ils augmentent terriblement les possibilit s de choix de partenariat mais il faut rester prudent tr s prudent
5936914 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5936915 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5936916 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5936917 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5936918 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5936919 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5936920 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5936921 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5936922 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5936923 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5936924 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5936925 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5936926 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5936927 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5936928 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5936929 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5936930 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5936931 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5936932 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5936933 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5936934 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5936935 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5936936 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5936937 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5936938 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5936939 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5936940 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5936941 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5936942 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5936943 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5936944 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5936945 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5936946 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5936947 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5936948 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5936949 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5936950 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5936951 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5936952 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5936953 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5936954 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5936955 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5936956 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5936957 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5936958 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5936959 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5936960 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5936961 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5936962 it is not pleasing that i placed humans among the primates but man knows himself let us get the words out of the way it will be equal to me by whatever name they are treated but i ask you and the whole world a generic difference between men and simians in accordance with the principles of natural history i certainly know none
5936963 there are as many species as the infinite being produced diverse forms in the beginning
5936964 it is really laughable to see what different ideas are prominent in various naturalists minds when they speak of species it all comes i believe from trying to define the indefinable
5936965 i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other
5936966 on my theory the present existence of lowly organised productions offers no difficulty for natural selection includes no necessary and universal law of advancement or development it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life
5936967 every naturalist who has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the scale must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautiful organisation
5936968 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5936969 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5936970 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5936971 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

5936978 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

5936981 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5936982 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5936983 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5936984 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5936985 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5936986 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5936987 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as

5936990 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5936991 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5936994 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5936995 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5936996 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5936997 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5936998 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5936999 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5937000 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5937001 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5937002 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5937003 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5937004 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5937005 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5937006 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

5937027 for whatever candidate comes in second theres plenty of time to reverse that order
5937028 the only way it would be damaging to one of the candidates is if the margin is breathtakingly high but my guess is it wont be

5937060 corporate finance is about getting to the very heart of a company and working closely with the management team advising on strategies for the business as well as identifying personal objectives
5937061 it is a very social profession and you need to be able to mix with people from every walk of life and take all situations in your stride
5937062 if people think youre good fun hardworking and give sound advice they certainly remember you and as a female you get invited to a lot more events which is great for networking and building up contacts

5937068 the cruise market has been growing steadily for the past decade and is showing no signs of slowing down with a predicted increase of 14 per cent this year alone
5937069 while certain sections of the travel industry are seeing the effects of the credit crunch cruise remains buoyant as more consumers seek all inclusive holiday options rather than run the risk of overspending or returning home to nasty credit card bills
5937070 more than 1 5m people in the uk take a cruise each year and we believe there is a gap in the market for a new cruise retailer delivering exceptional customer service

5937079 we expect continued supply issues but the situation is definitely getting better
5937080 its a hard game for them to play trying to predict how many phones they are going to sell and ultimately they are going to say its a good problem for them but we say it would be better not to have that problem at all
5937081 we have been quickly selling all the supplies we get
5937082 they have been using best buy pretty extensively with the macintosh
5937083 and the fact that they are going forward with that signals that they are pretty confident that the supply is going to be adequate
5937084 they have a much more complex supply chain than they had in the past
5937085 they are just having trouble figuring out where to put those things
5937086 the people who love the iphone are really willing to give them a lot of slack
5937087 there is a tremendous belief in what apple is trying to achieve and to them its the best phone they have ever had
5937088 the enemy is withdrawing and were conducting pursuit and blocking operations
5937089 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
5937090 there is confusion and an element of denial over direct property pricing due to lack of transactions

5937097 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

5937099 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5937100 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5937104 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5937105 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5937106 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5937107 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5937108 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5937109 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5937110 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5937111 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5937112 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5937113 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5937114 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5937115 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5937116 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5937117 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5937118 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5937119 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5937120 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5937121 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5937122 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5937123 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5937124 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5937125 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5937126 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5937127 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5937128 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5937129 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5937130 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5937131 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5937132 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5937133 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5937134 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5937135 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5937136 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5937137 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5937138 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5937139 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5937140 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5937141 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5937142 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5937143 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5937144 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5937145 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5937146 which of these isnt the name of a kia small car a spectra b rio c mentor d forgettable
5937147 apakah orang orang sekarang yakin bahwa hari ini dengan rusia sebagai mitra barat ancaman tersebut lebih besar dibandingkan sebelumnya
5937148 nato perlu diperluas kami mengerti bahwa pemerintah rusia merasa keberatan dengan itu tapi yang jelas kedua negara as dan rusia memiliki komitmen untuk menyelesaikan masalah ini
5937149 menjadi bukti bahwa kehadiran yeltsin bukan penentu untuk membuahkan hasil
5937150 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5937151 this is a planning took where all things are going
5937152 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5937153 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5937154 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5937155 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5937156 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5937157 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5937158 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5937159 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5937160 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5937161 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5937162 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5937163 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5937164 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5937165 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5937166 in their advertisement dominion said the average increase would be 3 4 percent for their customers
5937167 the ohio consumers council estimates the increase to be 16 9 percent why dont the numbers jive
5937168 my actual cost in gas is 12 to 13 a month the remainder is the companys base rate
5937169 now they want to increase the base rate it is just not right
5937170 i dont know anyone here that will see their incomes increase this year or any other year
5937171 look at the people here and in this community and a rate increase of even 10 is too much
5937172 under east ohio gas co the cost to replace a residential service lines was between 250 to 300
5937173 under dominion the cost went up to more than 800 per line
5937174 i have people who have taken care of themselves for more than 60 year who are embarrassed to have to come for help
5937175 i tell them youve help people in the past now it is time for others to help you
5937176 officers today have put in for overtime and ill have to deny it theres no money in that account
5937177 im going to ask for volunteers to work for free i dont think ill get any takers
5937178 i have to assume they still thought i was out of town i returned i was available
5937179 when im notified ill make the call on minimum staffing for the day
5937180 if we dont have call offs we should be fine in terms of staffing i want to encourage our patrolmen and all members of the department that unless theres an emergency to show up for work we cant afford to keep paying overtime
5937181 we feel that its unsafe to go out there with only two officers in the city if there are any major calls what happens
5937182 yes i do walk in my sleep with my eyes open i discovered i had it when i was a kid it sounds funny and we laugh about it but my parents have had sleepless nights they have turned into light sleepers since they were always worried about me
5937183 i even tried homeopathic treatment now i dont want to do any of that i am quite used to the condition and i normally tend to walk around only in my room subconsciously
5937184 once while i was shooting outdoors i woke up in the middle of the night and realised that i was trying to break the door lock the noise woke up the cast and crew
5937185 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5937186 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5937187 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5937188 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5937189 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5937190 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5937191 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5937192 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5937193 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5937194 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5937195 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5937196 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5937197 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5937198 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5937199 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5937200 yea thou shalt see thy childrens children and peace upon israel
5937201 is there a difference between the teaching of the catholic church and the teaching of the continuing churches
5937202 and the catholic faith is this that we worship one god in trinity and trinity in unity neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance
5937203 for health care professionals to support the distribution of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed if this were done in a doctors office the provincial college of physicians would rightly be investigating

5937218 unhcr does not take care of rohingya refugees and just show its accountability for rohingya refugees
5937219 but refugees in malaysia are different as they were being considered as illegal migrants and no right to work due to lack of assistance and legal representation by nearest unhcr they were facing difficulties with medication bills in their hospitalization
5937220 he was delayed admission of his painful in stomach for depository due he therefore approached to unhcr with hospitals admission card but unhcrs guard did not allow to enter him to report later he shouted from outside and then got entry but also reception officer asked to submit medical report firstly which does not give before medication therefore he own had ignored silently and back consently to home recently in 4 hours later he was lifted by a neighbor who also helped 300 rm deposit for emergency treatment
5937221 my husband was admitted at government hospital for 2 weeks but superior treatment required again for getting bad condition but before admission for such superior treatment hospital needs to get settle outstanding bills and assistance requires for me and children while my husband is serious though i had approached 2 times to unhcr reception officer asked medic bills but never asked my husbands condition he also does not know that never issue the bill before the payment so i had affected silent treatment but is committing as endangering of patients life
5937222 i am very aware of endangering patients life during accepts the report and bills to be fix in the frame or delaying by any means burden sharing therefore needed to be fix in accord with it rights and several of the same cases gone in silent but once they are recognized under un this report shall be submitted to the secretary general of the united nations
5937223 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5937224 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5937225 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5937226 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5937227 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5937228 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5937229 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5937230 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5937231 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5937232 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5937233 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5937234 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5937235 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5937236 if she keeps up the spirit she wont even know when its over
5937237 the hardest part was when i had my head shaved i prayed that though i was suffering from cancer my hair would stay it was something i was proud of the day i sheared it all off was the hardest to bear
5937238 yet i put on 20 kg but i did not shed a single tear because i knew i had the support of my family and friends besides i was confident that god would pull me through this
5937239 it was difficult but i dealt with it all with a smile its really your spirit that pulls you through and because i remained so positive my blood platelet count didnt drop drastically
5937240 the last i voted was 10 years ago when i was home on vacation i have voted only four times
5937241 though there are proxy voting system and postal ballot system in place things have not materialised as desired
5937242 i have never voted during my 16 years of service during the last general election i received my postal ballot well after the new government was formed
5937243 we are aware there are problems but the decision has to be taken by the government another possible solution can be that a soldier is allowed to vote wherever he is posted at the time of elections
5937244 instead of showing his licence he started arguing that he wasnt wearing a helmet as it was the parsi new year
5937245 i was crying in pain his wife tried to stop him but he didnt listen she even went to a nearby shop and bought a pain reliever for me
5937246 though there is no fracture i cant move my finger the doctor has asked me to rest for a few days
5937247 people blame us if there are any accidents but nobody co operates with us when we stop them for not wearing helmets

5937259 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger

5937267 derek christensen defines a missional church as a shift in thinking from church as sender to church as being sent there is also a change in focus from the mission orginating with us and being carried forward by our intiative to the mission being gods mission missio dei originating with god and we become partners with him in this task
5937268 im pretty good mates with al so i obviously want him to stay and id love for him to play for collingwood for the rest of his career
5937269 its crucial i suppose yeah you want to go into the finals with a fair bit of momentum but i think for the whole season weve built a fair bit of momentum over 12 months
5937270 the last few weeks have been a bit disappointing but weve got plenty of time to get it right
5937271 it is likely that if there will be a water crisis in the future it will not come because of actual physical scarcity of water as many predict at present but because of continuing neglect of proper wastewater management practices
5937272 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
5937273 rats have almost no bones and are quite rich in nutrition people at large dont know this cuisine fact but gradually they are catching up
5937274 yes that proposal is in its advance stage and well very soon engage them in various social activities of our department
5937275 ill make snake catching popular for the economic value of its venom
5937276 youd actually be writing the book for someone else but it wont have your name on it

5937286 george osbornes speech is both a calculated move to reposition the tories on traditional labour territory and a pre emptive strike against the prime ministers expected autumn relaunch
5937287 the shadow chancellor argues that it is the right which is now making the running on creating a fair society and encouraging social mobility
5937288 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty
5937289 george osbornes latest scattergun attack is just another example of the conservatives trying to avoid tough questions about their own unfunded and unfair policies
5937290 we trust the review of the 24 000 caseload would mean a vindication of our fathers quality of work at the miramichi hospital
5937291 the results will indeed greatly allay public anxiety and restore a little faith in a profession that has been the subject of intense scrutiny lately
5937292 we are working on a report and there will be an update but i cant give a specific time
5937293 we can expect the german contingent on the governing council to remain in relatively hawkish mode
5937294 those surveyed reckon with a weaker but all in all robust development and rightly do not fear a recession

5937296 sexual dysfunction among older adults prevalence and risk factors from a nationally representative u s probability sample of men and women 57 to 85 years of age
5937297 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
5937298 avoid the flimflammery of green consumerism itself an oxymoron unless there is a truly useful discovery or breakthrough to report perhaps that would assuage some of the eco anxiety out there and allow readers to think about more meaningful ways to help their planet
5937299 one of the reasons we keep getting called back i think is because weve never lost anyone and we plan on keeping it that way were doing the job right and were doing it safely
5937300 our defense was a little weak but they werent stronger than us
5937301 in the final minute we were able to win and we are happy
5937302 we just didnt play in sync and couldnt stick with it down the stretch
5937303 our players still dont know how to finish the game
5937304 we are playing with desperation and anxiety we are never calm
5937305 we have to be strong the whole game and play defense for four quarters
5937306 in this league when you have players come in and out so much the team concept can get lost you have to give teams that will to win
5937307 if you really want to make it you cant just sit around all day
5937308 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5937309 biggest thing really will be getting up on time ready even my kids are like oh man do i really have to go back to school i dont want to go back to school
5937310 whenever a student transfers to a different building or any kind of new thing there is always anxiety
5937311 kids that do better are the ones that get involved its important to join a club doesnt have to be sports anything that helps you get connected with school and helps you belong
5937312 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5937313 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5937314 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation

5937331 ive long been inspired by the works of the british visionaries arthur c clarke olaf stapledon h g wells and many others
5937332 in particular i love clarkes the city and the stars and stapledons starmaker one work that has received only marginal attention over the decades since its first publication is william hope hodgsons the night land which seems to have influenced clarke and perhaps even j r r tolkien cross clarkes diaspar and tolkiens mordor and you have the night land
5937333 the end of the universe is one hundred trillion years away but its about to change the lives of a trio of strangely talented young people in contemporary seattle

5937340 well if you dont like my ride why dont you go buy me something that you will like
5937341 we tried to add texture to all the characters and backgrounds as if they were an engraving
5937342 for example youll see that jacks stripes on his suit are hand drawn and the hills behind also have hand made textures built into them additional details would be things like the leaves that sallie is stuffed with the bugs inside oogie boogie
5937343 there are hidden details there that have never shown up on previoius dvds but will show up on the blu ray
5937344 oogie started out as the size of a pillowcase and not that scary or evil or important
5937345 as the story developed i felt the need to grow him in both his scale and his role ultimately danny eflmans oogie boogie song is what truly defined his character as the villian and jacks role was fully defined as a misguided hero
5937346 there has been discussions over the years about a possible sequel
5937347 when those discussions came up about seven years ago it was unsettling that it was suggested this time it would have to be done in cg im glad that did not happen
5937348 there was something interesting about doing a film that had the trappings of an action film but helmed by a french auteur
5937349 the toorop character playing a character that is that skeptical a character thats a cynic and not trusting i feel that there is a part of that in all of us
5937350 and to exercise that in the character to its fullest that felt exciting
5937351 these crimes clearly fit a pattern were up against someone who is very smart and very hard to catch
5937352 would you be surprised if they wanted vengeance my kids are afraid to walk on the ground
5937353 i think somebody needs to go down into those holes and knock a few heads until they get to the bottom of all this thats the only language these worm bastards understand
5937354 were doing all we can to find and we hope eat the perpetrators of these crimes
5937355 but until then we remind our fellow birds not to fear the worms theres just no way any worm could be smart enough to kill birds
5937356 mess with the geek you get the steel jaw trap
5937357 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5937358 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5937359 we have been assigned to reach a consensus on the situation within the next 72 hours
5937360 its no wonder that some of the performance opportunities have followed us
5937361 most of us believe that there is a specific lifestyle attitude related to jazz and improvisational music and linked to brooklyn
5937362 artists retain ownership of their recordings and buy in to bju records community
5937363 flexible community oriented do it yourself approach to the business of artistic life
5937364 the myth of new york as a center of art endures
5937365 but the reality is that it is not possible to live a bohemian lifestyle in new york city unless you have some special arrangement i just asked saxophonist joel frahm this same question
5937366 he just moved to brooklyn after 20 years in manhattan

5937369 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights
5937370 you could not criticise them either they have all kind of institutions unions
5937371 i must think positively i will not blame the circumstances and i do not give up easily i will pull myself together that is who i am
5937372 we really want to have some huge guest stars this year
5937373 we want to bring in other musical guests as well because of the dancing with the stars connection
5937374 im really really proud of the episode because it shows the range that the series can cover
5937375 even in a single episode you have this sort of emotional tear jerking kind of storyline but you also have what is basically a romantic comedy between jonny lee miller as eli and katie holmes its really kind of special that episode also introduces a major piece of mythology it is something that ties back to elis dad and it is something will propel the plot going into the rest of the season
5937376 a non profit do gooder attorney cut from the same cloth that eli is
5937377 they have phenomenal onscreen chemistry i have to say they really do katie sings and dances she has her own musical number which is a lot of fun im still waiting to see how the musical number for episode one turns out but i have to say so far katie has set the bar in terms of the quality of the musical number its easily the best one weve had on the show thus far
5937378 we designed that finale to work as a series finale god forbid we didnt get renewed basically the premiere takes place in real time it takes place six months after that last episode and its sort of designed for two things
5937379 thus they came to the land of canaan abram passed through the land as far as the site of shechem to the oak of moreh now the canaanite was then in the land the lord appeared to abram and said to your descendents literally to your seed i will give this land so he built an alter there to the lord who had appeared to him then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent with bethel on the west and ai on the east and there he built an alter to the lord and called upon the name of the lord abram journeyed on continuing toward the negev
5937380 by faith abraham when he was called obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance and he went out not knowing where he was going
5937381 but in these last days he has spoken in the son
5937382 whats it like for christ to be your life what is it like to dwell in christ what is it like to remain in him what is it like to abide in him do you hear these questions and the answer is you cannot know in the natural it must be revealed to you what does the lord reveal to abraham
5937383 the names have changed but the music is still the same

5937387 but would probably not put up numbers for the record book 2
5937388 topics but none of those ever amounted to anything because they required intelligent thought and at least a limited amount of skill thus i started this little project mainly because i figured it would be a good way to waste time besides it was cheaper than drugs

5937406 no person alive or dead embodies this city as he does for many ronnie drew is quite simply the voice of
5937407 weddings funerals bar mitzvahs thats what i loved about ronnie drews voice and spirit

5937414 this is the closest we have to a world cup and im stoked to see the athletes bring their a game and take this race seriously
5937415 it took a while to get comfortable with the course
5937416 i tried not to stall in corners and hang it out where i could to get the win
5937417 i have feelings for this girl amanda on my school lord and i want to court her towards marriage
5937418 amanda i want to tell you something but i am not sure if i should i am freaking out about it
5937419 there are two really good reasons why we wont be moving
5937420 were not saying the riders wont use the new velodrome they would be mad not to before the olympics indeed before beijing the squad went down to train at the track in newport but manchester will remain our main headquarters for the olympic and paralympic squads
5937421 this sport is not just for gold medalists like chris hoy and victoria pendleton its for the local community too we have a popular programme for school groups and a community club run by volunteers jason queally who won a gold in 2000 started in one of our taster sessions
5937422 the value of the velodrome is its a real melting pot pensioners schoolchildren and the elite cyclists all use the same facilities the kids will be getting ready when the olympians pass through sometimes they might be cycling alongside them
5937423 people have been phoning to book sessions and saying their child wants to ride in the 2012 olympics
5937424 the university has reached a settlement with dr mcmaster and we cannot comment on any outstanding grievance issues concerning him
5937425 i am inquisitive by nature which has helped me in my job but in this case it seems to have been my downfall
5937426 it was a stupid thing to do but it was just a knee jerk reaction
5937427 now criminal proceedings have finished our professional standards branch will carry out an internal investigation
5937428 bij gezonde volwassenen is de kans om met succes gereanimeerd te worden al beperkt bij zieke ouderen is deze kans nog veel kleiner daarnaast is bij deze laatste groep de kans groot dat de kwaliteit van het leven sterk achteruitgaat
5937429 vrijwel altijd gepaard met het verlies van belangrijke lichamelijke en geestelijke vermogens
5937430 why do you take so long to get settled down for dinner back in my day we had to run to the dinner table so there would be something left for us to eat
5937431 what im trying to say is that you boys have no sense of ambition i had to work hard when i was young because we didnt have money while youre happy with the status quo no ambition
5937432 do you boys think ive got a bottomless pocket full of money
5937433 i happen to haul my weight around here im the one who pays for the cable and the internet service and the phone bill and the weekend groceries sure your situation was different back then but that doesnt mean we dont know the value of hard work
5937434 i hope i live long enough to see how you raise your children
5937435 sigh why do you have to say things like that huh
5937436 you dont need to worry its not your fault you grew up that way i should have raised you better
5937437 waarom wordt een hond of een paard lang niet zo oud als een olifant een papegaai of een schildpad
5937438 bij gewervelde dieren hangt de levensduur vaak samen met de lichaamsgrootte en de stofwisseling
5937439 als publiekslieveling lorre vroeger overleed verving de dierentuin hem door een andere papegaai die kreeg dan ook de naam lorre
5937440 zo woeden er hevige discussies over de leeftijden van walvissen walvissen hebben groeilijnen sommige wetenschappers denken dat een groeilijn voor n jaar staat anderen denken dat zon lijn voor twee levensjaren staat als een overleden walvis veertig groeilijnen heeft zou hij dus veertig of tachtig jaar kunnen zijn
5937441 hoorde u hoe de toonhoogte halverwege wat zakte en aan het einde weer omhoogging
5937442 de mensen willen graag autoruiten die aan de bovenkant een beetje bol staan dat ziet er mooier uit het gevolg is wel dat de ruit halverwege een beetje klem in de sponning komt te zitten en er pas aan het eind weer mooi inpast de elektromotor voor de raambediening moet dus in het midden harder werken en zakt iets in toerental en in toonhoogte constructief gezien is dat geen enkel probleem maar de klant krijgt de indruk dat die motor het maar n t trekt en dat is strijdig met het beeld dat ze van een bmw hebben
5937443 na het uiterlijk van een auto is het geluid het eerste dat een aspirant koper opvalt de betrouwbaarheid de veiligheid en de milieuvriendelijkheid zijn ook allemaal belangrijke factoren maar een nieuwe klant die een proefrit maakt merkt daar niets van je moet hem pakken met het uiterlijk met styling en met geluid
5937444 wij ontwerpen geluiden die niet authentiek zijn maar die de klanten voor authentiek houden
5937445 een autodeur is van dun plaatstaal gemaakt hij is maar 0 7 mm dik heel normaal dat je een blikkerig geluid krijgt als je die dichtslaat maar een bmw rijder verwacht een solide klik dus wij monteren antidreunmatten en we passen de constructie van het portierslot aan
5937446 aanvankelijk was geluid vooral iets wat bestreden moest worden bijvoorbeeld bij stofzuigers ze maken nu veel minder geluid dan vroeger
5937447 als een stofzuiger heel stil is denken mensen dat ie niet werkt
5937448 hoe een apparaat eruitziet is het eerste beslissende moment maar het tweede komt als je de stekker in het stopcontact steekt en hoort welk geluid het maakt het team dat het senseo koffiezetapparaat heeft ontworpen kwam er pas laat achter dat het apparaat niet goed klonk te goedkoop ze hebben er net zo lang aan gesleuteld tot het wel goed klonk
5937449 denk maar aan de klappen die een harley davidson motorfiets maakt het is een belangrijk deel van de identiteit van dat merk maar ze kunnen met geluid ook informatie overdragen een bliepje dat je vertelt dat je een toets van je telefoon goed hebt ingedrukt een reeks piepjes als je de veiligheidsgordels niet omdoet of het opgewekte plieng als de magnetron klaar is met je eten dat moet allemaal ontworpen worden
5937450 een luxe personenwagen moet zijdezacht lopen een sportwagen mag best wat rauwer klinken en bij een suv moet je de indruk krijgen dat die zich door elke modderpoel heen kan werken we kunnen al die geluiden nu op de computer simuleren en op die manier beslissen hoe een nieuwe auto moet gaan klinken
5937451 het is alleen wel jammer dat hoe zuiniger je een motor maakt des te rauwer hij gaat klinken daar is niet zo veel aan te doen
5937452 we zijn er al lang mee bezig we hebben al heel vroeg de cd laatjes zo gemaakt dat ze soepel klinken en geen plastic geratel produceren
5937453 toen de philips whirlpool wasmachines werden uitgerust met antigeluid een voorziening die het hinderlijke geluid opheft door een tegengestelde geluidsgolf te produceren kregen we veel wasmachines terug met kapot gerukte handels ze waren zo stil geworden dat mensen dachten dat ze het niet deden
5937454 ik rijd in een toyota prius en als je op een parkeerterrein manoeuvreert horen de mensen je niet want dat doet hij op zijn elektromotor ik heb al een paar keer gehad dat voetgangers schrokken omdat ze mijn auto niet hadden opgemerkt blijkbaar houd je er onbewust rekening mee dat je oren je wel zullen waarschuwen
5937455 the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified 24 i tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains only a single seed but if it dies it produces many seeds
5937456 why does your face look so sad when you are not ill this can be nothing but sadness of heart
5937457 may the king live forever why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire
5937458 if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight let him send me to the city in judah where my fathers are buried so that i can rebuild it
5937459 how long will your journey take and when will you get back
5937460 if it pleases the king may i have letters to the governors of trans euphrates so that they will provide me safe conduct until i arrive in judah 8 and may i have a letter to asaph keeper of the kings forest so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence i will occupy
5937461 lord be with me and let me not forget who i am during this meeting
5937462 fear no man of any size call on me and ill equalize
5937463 i tell you this man went down to his home justified
5937464 fear no man of any size call on me and ill equalize
5937465 fear no man of any size call on me and ill equalize
5937466 the chopra center for wellbeing endorses zrii as a high quality reliable formulation of the rejuvenative fruit amalaki emblica officinalis over 100 scientific studies suggest that this fruit which has been held in high esteem by ayurvedic doctors for millennia has measurable health benefits the chopra center has been encouraging a daily dose of amalaki for over a decade zrii provides a balanced pleasing and concentrated source of this nutritive food

5937475 what we see here is a real opportunity for people to come out and experience nascar in more temperate conditions
5937476 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
5937477 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
5937478 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
5937479 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
5937480 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
5937481 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
5937482 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
5937483 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
5937484 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
5937485 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
5937486 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
5937487 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
5937488 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
5937489 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
5937490 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
5937491 he looked good really good usc team physician dr james tibone said

5937503 artinya engkau membicarakan saudaramu tentang sesuatu yang ia tidak suka bila itu dibicarakan
5937504 bagaimana bila yang aku katakan itu memang benar ada pada saudaranya
5937505 artinya jika memang benar bahwa yang kau katakan itu ada padanya berarti engkau telah menggunjingnya jika itu tidak ada padanya berarti engkau telah berdusta tentangnnya
5937506 artinya hai orang orang yang beriman jauhilah kebanyakan dari prasangka sesungguhnya sebagian prasangka itu adalah dosa dan janganlah kamu mencari cari kesalahan orang lain dan janganlah sebagian kamu menggunjing sebagian yang lain sukakah salah seorang di antara kamu memakan daging saudaranya yang sudah mati maka tentulah kamu merasa jijik kepadanya dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha penerima taubat lagi maha penyayang

5937523 the additional revenue helps keep future rate increases lower or helps avoid future rate increases because you have to bill accurately and all were asking is for people to pay what theyre billed

5937537 concerned that obama may be increasingly framed as not manly enough by the republican party mccain camp
5937538 is conflated with masculinity in the minds of most americans in short a great way to weaken a presidential opponent is to subtly feminize him
5937539 people like to say he is a black jack kennedy fine up to a point kennedy was smart elegant very well spoken slim handsome but he also was irish sharp quick and abundant sense of humor able to make contact with people
5937540 obamas fundamental problem with voters is that he sometimes comes across as an elitist who talks down to them dismissing their worries and telling them what they really should be concerned about voters dont like being addressed in this manner
5937541 clearly connects with a ton of folks but so did almost president howard dean the polls continue to say that this is tied obama should be 15 20 points ahead the fact that he is not should worry them i honestly believe obama may have a glass jaw
5937542 barack obama needs to work hard to win white working class voters but thankfully hes not adlai stevenson john mccain is not dwight eisenhower and todays america is not the america of the 1950s
5937543 obama was a community organizer in a neighborhood where the steel mills had shut down obama does know how to address economic grievances and also how to connect these complaints with the sense that our democracy is as broken as our economy obama needs to continue fleshing out his economic agenda and contrast it with mccains halfhearted embrace of bushs failed policies but his elevated rhetoric and down to earth policy prescriptions can reinforce each other as they did with fdr and jfk
5937544 the kind of rhetoric that obama is employing below is really not that out of kilter in a change election in fact its pretty standard i think this call for more specifics is hugely overrated and unnecessary on the issues obama is favored particularly domestic issues the big questions are really about personality and intangibles like experience
5937545 friends and colleagues comment on the possibility that obama could become the egghead candidate
5937546 the current administration has given anti intellectualism a bad name with the outcomes of that kind of know nothingism on display the republicans may find it harder to criticize obama for being an intellectual though they may find other ways to paint him as an elitist
5937547 that stereotyping about candidate competence to govern in a political context dominated by the war on terrorism may work to the detriment of women candidates at least at the presidential level it wasnt that candidates have to be manly but rather that traditional conceptions of strong leaders tend to be more consistent with images of male as opposed to female politicians
5937548 c ontrary to what john mccains advisers will say we are not a bunch of whiners we will suck it up
5937549 economics by john mccain support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first

5937564 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5937565 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5937566 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5937567 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5937592 the shortage of interpreters will pose a problem because its already difficult enough to get to guantanamo and to see ones client
5937593 if we got them to change the rules the number of hours and we worked new york lawyers hours instead of a european auto plant workers schedule there would be less of a problem
5937594 perhaps at guantanamo like no where else the interpreter has to change the nuance of what is being said
5937595 culture islamic culture is very important at guantanamo sometimes the lawyer will make a politically incorrect statement you raise your eyebrows try to get their attention or get them to rephrase or you leave things out and tell the lawyer later what he should not have been saying
5937596 it is good information to collect for an affidavit but they are very private about women in their families

5937607 i understand another rumor is flying out there last week it was running back controversy in miami
5937608 the maitred in miami asked almost condescendingly as he then scanned the floor of tables for two four and more all mostly without customers and spotted one in a dark corner surely the deuces and four tops would arrive later and be real business it was a feh fay 6
5937609 yes i was just wondering how much itll cost me to preserve my wedding dress
5937610 a window in the box so you can see it
5937611 okay thanks i might be calling you in future to um preserve my dress
5937612 hi my boyfriend bought an engagement ring from you guys and um i said no
5937613 and hes too embarrassed to ask about your return policy so im doing it for him
5937614 hey i want to set you up with this guy hes gay and he lives in the woods with scary monsters
5937615 the nhs has responded impressively to the first five years of the national service framework
5937616 more and more people with diabetes are getting good routine care
5937617 there have been a number of fires on the site all of which were started deliberately it is by sheer luck no one has been injured although part of the site has suffered damage as a result of one of the fires
5937618 we are treating this as arson with intent to endanger life a very serious offence which carries a lengthy prison sentence
5937619 if anyone has any information about the person or people responsible please dont hesitate to get in touch
5937620 we received a call at 9 53 regarding a fire involving cardboard and wood in an isolated room it was reported by a site foreman who had stamped it out by the time we arrived
5937621 we sent one fire engine followed soon after by a fire investigation team while the team were there they were informed by another builder of another small fire which he had put out with an extinguisher and of two other small fires dealt with by workers all the incidents are being treated as suspicious
5937622 it is a busy site with people there from 7am it would be very easy for someone to run around with a lighter to different parts of the site and go unnoticed
5937623 everyone is fed up of the constant interruptions and we are nervous we cant understand why whoever it is hasnt been caught yet
5937624 she opened the door and i could smell turps i sat up and asked had she knocked the turps over she did not say anything
5937625 i heard the lighter go as if she was lighting a cigarette she was stood in the living room
5937626 there were a lot of flames i was trying to use cushions and get her garment off her it was obvious that her garment was on fire
5937627 she started to get niggly and i cannot say about what i had a happy life and she loved her son
5937628 it is unlikely that adults would survive burns as extensive as this
5937629 they had argued but it was no different to general domestic arguments it was an attention seeking or temper reaction
5937630 i am sure that she did the act that caused her death but i am not sure that she intended to take her own life
5937631 the fire service has been magnificent with its support for the family
5937632 at the scene of the fire he was still conscious though in shock and pain at wythenshawe hospital he was still conscious but when he went into the intensive care unit the sedation started because of the pain and so doctors could manage him better
5937633 when he opened his eyes his first words to his family were hiya pete hiya mam to his mother and her partner
5937634 when he spoke to his nieces my daughters hayley and louise it was quite emotional nurses told me hes very lucky to be here hes still very poorly but his burns are healing
5937635 god willing he will make a full recovery but we know that could be a long way off he is having physiotherapy every day for 15 minutes to move his arms and legs he will have to learn to walk again
5937636 recovery will take time but given his courage and tenacity we are sure he will overcome the difficulties
5937637 we have no control of what the university do it was scientists at manchester who first successfully split the atom and we had no control of them back then either it will be a sad day if the city becomes notorious for being the centre of the countrys nuclear industry
5937638 it doesnt alter our view that nuclear energy is against the best interests of our citizens and the world in general
5937639 we believe our team offers the right blend of capabilities covering nuclear research skills development laboratory operations government contract management
5937640 we have not yet formally committed to bidding for the contract as we await the launch of the competitive process and further information from government
5937641 the universitys involvement in access to the lab in future is not exclusive and will allow all british academics to engage as necessary
5937642 i made it very clear it is not my job to make economic decisions
5937643 however it is important we act on the pressures now facing not only people on low incomes but also the hard pressed middle classes on fixed incomes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor and pensioners whose small occupational pensions or savings mean they miss out on extra benefits
5937644 contrary to the spin i did not propose a super tax on the rich what i said was if the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5937645 i totally deplore the politics of envy but i strongly believe labour must always be the party of fairness
5937646 now you will discover the definitive truth about 9 11 and learn why even the most popular movies on the subject have failed to address the evidence exhaustively presented in this video
5937647 voters want to know youre in to win it you shouldnt be half committed
5937648 where the emperor suggests that the marriage of figaro contains too many notes to which mozart proclaims there are just as many notes majesty as are required neither more nor less
5937649 of course the people on the team represent the way we get feature requests implemented and develop end to end scenarios so the challenge is to have the right team and the right structure to maximise the ability to get those done neither too many nor too few
5937650 but standards seem to fly in the face of the entire concept of open source
5937651 linux flavors present endless opportunities for customization some of us like consistency i want a standard desktop environment
5937652 if only i may touch his clothes i shall be made well
5937653 im sorry i just dont think you will work out
5937654 i dont expect you to feel the same and i am happy to just be friends i just wanted you to know
5937655 i just got a call from the school and my son mark arrived with no shoes
5937656 yes mrs espinosa your son is here in the office shoeless
5937657 i can assure you maam he has no shoes on
5937658 did he lose them were they stolen what exactly happened
5937659 he left home without them youll have to bring him some shoes
5937660 why did you turn on the aircon already i need to be pawis so i can change into my extra shirt
5937661 while there are many applications to be drawn out of the story of gideon we cannot help but see the warning to us all about the perils of misplaced affections a desire for honor became the snare for all of israel and perpetuated their propensity towards idolatry subtle and seemingly innocuous our desires can quickly become entities we worship it is a reminder to us all to ask what are our desires and what do they tell us about what we love once said a person will worship something have no doubt about that we may think our tribute is paid in secret in the dark recesses of our hearts but it will out that which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives and our character therefore it behooves us to be careful what we worship for what we are worshipping we are becoming
5937662 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field
5937663 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5937664 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5937665 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5937666 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5937667 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5937668 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5937669 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5937670 when guys are in the training room and theyre not out here practicing youve to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5937671 we havent done anything as of today on that but i think thats kind of a dead issue
5937672 you know i said what i said and the situation is what it is so to keep dwelling on it isnt going to do us any good
5937673 at the heart of the wellington political process for close to 30 years
5937674 equality fairness and freedom a labour view on kiwi politics labour candidate for hunua
5937675 if i made that noise would you fuck me that hard
5937676 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5937677 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5937678 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5937679 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5937680 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5937681 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5937682 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5937683 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5937684 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5937685 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5937686 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5937687 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5937688 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5937689 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5937690 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5937691 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5937692 you know when it comes to rolling this out perfect is the enemy of good enough
5937693 lets put some lipstick on this pig and roll her out stop youre bitching the users will just have to deal with the issues
5937694 it is a comprehensive security program to protect the lower manhattan area indeed all of manhattan from vehicle born explosive devices
5937695 this is more like being under communist reign instead of being in a free country and being able to choose where you want to go when you want to go and not be monitored at all times
5937696 i mean if you dont have anything to worry about you wont worry
5937697 now if youre trying to hide something and they scan your license plate you have a problem then theres good reason
5937698 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
5937699 im going to make sure this doesnt happen again to anybody
5937700 im angry about it because i wanted to come home this isnt me and im sad but im trying to keep positive
5937701 i want to say that this is a cool ride the deputies are good people
5937702 they didnt believe me nobody believed me until i got there
5937703 they finally did something about it when they found out it wasnt me
5937704 i went to public restrooms with people looking at me asking questions and im telling them im not guilty
5937705 well lets see what this is all about before i sign up

5937709 i have targeted the nov 4 crowd from the minute the supreme court changed our primary system
5937710 were pretty sure he wont be able to buy this election
5937711 character in the long run is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations alike
5937712 what lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us
5937713 you can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him
5937714 para sopir yang membunuh orang lain akibat kelalaian berkendara kini tidak bisa lagi melenggang bebas dengan hanya membayar denda
5937715 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5937716 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5937717 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5937718 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5937719 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5937720 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5937721 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5937722 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5937723 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
5937724 we conceived it as a throwback to a pre digital era theres something about a jukebox doing battle with pesky ipods that seems to resonate with people its a kind of protest against the technology rat race particularly where music is concerned
5937725 gary the owner shouldnt be allowed to have the dog back
5937726 he the owner told me personally that he trained it to be mean to law enforcement
5937727 igor is very trainable very smart and a good dog
5937728 i have two little dogs who are best friends with igor and hed never hurt them
5937729 even as i was screaming and being bitten he never came for the dog
5937730 i wouldnt want to be a city that under any circumstances or conditions let this animal back out again while we all held our breath for the next bite
5937731 i wish they didnt have to but it seems like its really necessary to protect people you cant just stop a dog like that
5937732 i think the city should say one bite and youre out of dog parks
5937733 i really think they middleton police have an obligation to refer this to the district attorney
5937734 given the year its been and how much effort hes put in to try to get himself right i dont think its really a surprise
5937735 i think weve kind of been conditioning ourselves to be prepared to go on should he not be able to pitch
5937736 the likelihood of this being season ending is probably very real
5937737 what hes got to do is not make any kind of decision where emotions are involved with an arm problem
5937738 he showed this spring that his body is still strong
5937739 well wait a while and see what he wants to do

5937757 with fuel costs at never before seen record highs for much of the year and airlines around the world struggling to cope this result is a testament to our team and business model
5937758 implemented a range of measures in recent months to mitigate the impact of increased fuel costs and we will continue to closely monitor the operating environment and take whatever actions are necessary to see our way through what is expected to be a challenging period
5937759 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5937760 if the stocks drop i expect crude prices to rise but it will be within the 118 120 a barrel range if the stocks increase or are flat i expect prices to be around the 112 113 a barrel level
5937761 that is why we wont see prices falling below 112 a barrel
5937762 the intention has always been for the airline ultimately to be wholly owned by nigerian investors it is now time for virgin nigeria to go its own way with local shareholders
5937763 wishes to focus on growing its core long haul business
5937764 it is regrettable that events have caused us to review our shareholding and whether it is appropriate that the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria
5937765 in fact virgin nigeria has benefited from highly attractive lease rates offered by virgin atlantic while royalty fees are payable for the use of the virgin brand virgin nigeria has not paid anything since its launch

5937770 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely and run with endurance the race set out for us keeping our eyes fixed on jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith for the joy set out for him he endured the cross disregarding its shame and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of god
5937771 god exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father

5937781 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
5937782 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
5937783 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
5937784 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
5937785 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
5937786 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
5937787 sorry to ruin the fun but an ice age cometh
5937788 i had three phone calls today after it was discussed on a radio station
5937789 right now we are presenting options to the kids and the families that disagree with that book
5937790 if theres a problem with the book you got to go to the principal and say i want to exercise my right to another option
5937791 we can offer a mechanism for parents to address it we cant assure they do
5937792 we have a process in place anyone uncomfortable with it should contact the principal
5937793 its the descriptive aspect of it if i want that kind of description ill go buy a playboy why is that content there for kids to read
5937794 from time to time it is difficult to predict what is objectionable
5937795 what about the kids who read it they dont want to do a second one
5937796 its geared toward those who want to get in and get out in under an hour here we do the laundry for you
5937797 the kids have behaved we havent even had one crayon on the wall

5937801 already from his youth nourished his faith and spiritual life from the sources of other christian traditions thus crossing over certain confessional limits his desire to follow a monastic vocation and with that intention to found a new community with reformed christians says much about this search
5937802 the faith of the prior of taiz was enriched with the patrimony of the faith of the catholic church according to his own testimony referring precisely to the mystery of the catholic faith he understood certain elements of the faith such as the role of the virgin mary in the history of salvation the real presence of christ in the eucharistic gifts and the churchs apostolic ministry in response the catholic church accepted his access to communion
5937803 received communion on many occasions from the hands of john paul ii who had a bond of friendship with him since the time of the second vatican council and who was familiar with his journey in the catholic faith
5937804 in this connection there was nothing secret or concealed in the posture of the catholic church either in taiz or in rome
5937805 reconciling in himself the faith of his origins with the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking communion with anyone
5937806 in his conscience he had entered into the mystery of the catholic faith as one who grows without the need to abandon or break with what he had received or lived before
5937807 out of respect for the journey of faith of the prior of taiz it would be preferable in his case not to apply categories that he considered inappropriate for his experience and that moreover the catholic church never wished to impose on him
5937808 on one hand the prior of taiz felt very close to the bishops of rome in their concern to lead the church of christ on the path of spiritual renewal christian unity service to the poor and witness of the gospel
5937809 profoundly understood and supported by the popes in his personal spiritual journey and in the direction that the young community of taiz was taking

5937813 sejak awal lagi saya katakan isu sebenar yang berlaku ialah melibatkan antara saiful dan anwar dan ini tidak ada kena mengena dengan bn barisan nasional
5937814 dalam sistem kita mana mana individu yang dituduh boleh membersihkan diri atau maruah sama ada dengan cara islam atau cara mahkamah dan saiful memilih cara islam dan kini terpulanglah pada rakyat menilai sumpah saiful itu
5937815 mohd saiful sepatutnya mengemukakan segala dakwaan atau keterangan di mahkamah dan bukan di tempat awam serta disiarkan media kata beliau berpendapat tindakan mohd saiful bersumpah laknat seolah olah tidak menghormati dan mencabar kewibawaan insitusi mahkamah
5937816 mengapa nak libatkan keturunannya dilaknat sampai bila bila keturunan tak bersalah diri sendiri buat salah perlu ditanggung sendiri
5937817 saya telah merujuk kepada mahkamah syariah berkenaan dakwaan ini sebulan yang lalu dan pihak mahkamah mahu menemui saiful tetapi polis tidak membenarkan pegawai mahkamah berjumpa dengannya saiful
5937818 permainan apa ini apa polis punya permainan kalau nak ikutkan prosedur islam pergilah ke mahkamah syariah ini gimik politik

5937824 when you have teams in different countries they can work in their native language
5937825 today with increasing globalization data entering the data stream is internationalized
5937826 theres more than western english and thats why we see an uptick of interest in doing what we call matching cross script
5937827 there are regulatory requirements that everyone who wants to conduct business knows who theyre doing business with so they arent dealing with suspected criminals or terrorists

5937934 they must acknowledge a dangerous and painful truth key leaders of pakistans military and its inter services intelligence agency have long collaborated with armed islamic extremists operating in afghanistan the indian province of kashmir and pakistans own tribally administered regions along the afghan border in their eyes these extremists serve pakistans strategic interests in reality as the times has extensively reported these militants kill american and nato soldiers indian diplomats and pakistani civilians
5937935 it will take personal courage and broad political support to clean up these forces and finally bring them under civilian control pakistans leaders will better their odds if they stop pretending that the fight against terrorism is somehow americas problem and not pakistans they will also have to stop pretending that ad hoc cease fires and bribes to insurgent leaders can roll back the taliban threat

5937975 chapter three paragraph 7 theyd be breaking the law themselves if tried to do otherwise as the people who laid these charges are themselves facing charges placed by me i assume these charges come from captain rodgers and her patrol and are unsubstantiated except by their accusations
5937976 well wed be playing into their hands if we didnt co operate im sorry howard first they beat you up then they want to jail you lets go
5937977 im afraid hell have to stay in captain ive got a gelding order here for him if he is found to have been beyond your control well theyll cut of course charges of irresponsibility on your part would be diminished by that

5937985 of course well keep some every man will have as many women as he pleases to take whenever he wants male rule
5937986 violence and killing will not achieve anything we must be gentle
5937987 as i said the first time that they sent me out of town it was over to rudolstadt fall of 1632 that was i ran into lenore again there she was taking some kind of class at the chancery i knew perfectly well that her family was a little bit out of my league but she was the only american girl in town so we started to see one another what with one thing and another i proposed not right away but pretty near to it what do they call it
5937988 i saw a program about it on tv once before we got ourselves stuck here oprah or somebody you were right about out of your league though if i do say so myself thats why i stuck my oar in when laurie wanted to go to nursing school and i was right wasnt i just her wanting to go and get herself above gary led to a divorce
5937989 maybe i should have broken it off right after i proposed
5937990 i should have realized then that she was a bitch before it was too late i should have left it if a womans been somewhere else before she marries whos to say she wont go there again afterwards
5937991 anyhow we moved back to grantville a couple of months later after i finished up in rudolstadt then we had the kid and lenore invented a stupid name so she could call a girl after her father id said that i didnt care what name she chose if it was a girl hell i was so tired all the time right then that i didnt even want to think about baby names but id been expecting her to pick something normal jessica maybe or caitlin or after one of our mothers something like that
5937992 i dont think ive ever heard of any other little girl named weshelle
5937993 but at least it isnt a kraut name some of the men around here are letting their kraut wives give kraut names to babies that are half american
5937994 id hated it in rudolstadt being off in a foreign town not very far but too far to go back and forth every day then for the two months after the kid was born she squalled her lungs out day and night whenever i was trying to get some sleep between calls so coming back to grantville was actually worse in some ways given the way that kid yelled i wouldnt actually have minded being sent to magdeburg all that much even if i do have to deal with another batch of foreigners all the time if it hadnt been for having stannard as my boss
5937995 weshelle should be beyond that crying stage now shes almost a year old
5937996 yeah instead shes starting to walk and gets into everything if lenore doesnt keep her penned up smears food all over her face and into her hair and all over me if i let her get near a whole handful of mashed squash on my good blue shirt
5937997 sometimes kids that age can get to be a real pain
5937998 roasted turnips are not the same as baked potatoes no matter what the menu here claims sometimes i wish that i could get drunk
5937999 well dont im proud of you for sticking to the baptist teetotalling line i do myself for the methodists even though theyre getting slack these days
5938000 damn kid here ive been gone for nine months and its pretty clear that lenore didnt miss me much stays in the nursery until weshelle is sound asleep jumps up out of bed in the middle of the night and goes to sleep on the cot in the nursery if she hears the least little bit of fussing
5938001 she probably said yes because she was far too proper to have a baby in anything but marriage if not too proper to have sex outside it beforehand boy but that grated on me id been around a bit myself had a few girlfriends but its different for a man
5938002 ive sort of always thought that whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
5938003 and after we got married i thought she would obey me at least we left that in the ceremony i thought that after she agreed to be married by brother green shed change over to baptist but she wont just because she says i hardly ever go myself so why should she change
5938004 im methodist myself so i dont think that you should really complain about that after all methodist is really the right church the others just sort of try and its teetotal too like the baptists or it should be though i have my doubts about the reverends jones maybe you could change
5938005 im your cousin and old enough to be your grandmother so i can say what i please especially when its the truth theres no reason for her to change churches
5938006 plus now she wants to go back to work she has more education than i do and wants to show it off i suppose
5938007 maybe thats why she doesnt want to sleep with you
5938008 having another baby would interfere but i already told you what i think of women who have more schooling than their husbands i know what it leads to i went through it myself
5938009 so im stuck i guess shell never do anything to give me a reason to divorce her now that were married well probably not she acts as prim and prissy as old wes jenkins himself but you know she wouldnt ever have been to my taste up time i would never even have asked her out the only reason i did was that she was the only american woman that i could date in rudolstadt that fall
5938010 hes a foreigner but not a kraut hes working for gary his name is jacques pierre dumais and hes pretty nice a good listener as oprah would have said maybe it would help if you could talk some of these things out with him
5938011 i just hope i broke up the ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here

5938041 estas instalaciones que cuentan con m s de 50 a os se encuentran deterioradas debido a su falta de mantenimiento y obsoletas por la carencia que existe para dar cobertura a las necesidades que exigen los nuevos servicios que ofrecen los sindicatos por esta raz n en otros municipios ya se est n realizando acuerdos para trasladar dichas sedes a edificios que puedan dar cabida a nuevas actividades como asistencia al trabajador aulas de formaci n profesional salas de conferencias biblioteca etc
5938042 para determinar unas nuevas condiciones urban sticas del futuro edificio hotelero se ha realizado un estudio de las edificaciones existentes de la zona por parte de los servicios t cnicos municipales con objeto de establecer unos par metros urban sticos acordes con el entorno y que permitan construir un edificio singular y representativo de nuestra ciudad por lo que se permitir una altura de bajo m s cinco plantas con una edificabilidad m xima de 6 300 metros cuadrados
5938043 facilitar t cnicamente la ejecuci n de un edificio singular en el centro de motril que albergue el nuevo hotel
5938044 es patente el d ficit en nuestra ciudad de aquellos servicios hoteleros
5938045 al no existir oferta de este tipo en la ciudad de motril principalmente por la carencia de suelo y el alto valor del mismo lo que coarta la iniciativa privada interesada en la implantaci n de hoteles
5938046 muy negativamente el acuerdo alcanzado entre las dos grandes fuerzas pol ticas de motril pp psoe para desproteger el edificio de los sindicatos y promover su cambio de clasificaci n pasando de equipamiento p blico a uso hotelero y triplicando su edificabilidad
5938047 no esta justificada la p rdida de este edificio que representa un estilo arquitect nico singular y que socialmente es la muestra de una etapa pol tica deplorable pero cuyo mantenimiento permite el sostenimiento vivo de la memoria sobre pr cticas sociales y sindicales que no deben repetirse

5938063 i sat by the pool for most of it and come sunday i was thinking i would like to sit there for another week
5938064 but the fedex cup is what is attracting me out here again this week and the idea of it is to get players out to compete at this time of year after two majors you think well i could do with a rest but theres other things to play for so thats why im here this week
5938065 i did make sure i rested last week and ive got a little bit of experience now from winning these majors so i knew what to do afterwards
5938066 i believe i will be ready but im never truly able to tell until im into the tournament and i can see how i play
5938067 i remember last year i did struggle in the first couple of the fedex cup tournaments and i did end up having to pull out of a tournament because i was fatigued
5938068 this time round i feel better and stronger im motivated theres lots to play for
5938069 im looking forward to playing it the barclays is on a very nice golf course
5938070 i played 12 holes yesterday its a good old style golf course and it will be an interesting week therell be some good scoring some difficult tricky holes out there as well what you kind of expect from a tillinghast course and it looks like it will be a good tournament

5938075 the sustainability of new zealands existing port sector investment the industrys ability to invest in the future and the global competitiveness of the countrys supply chain might be assisted by the purchase of port of taurangas container business by ports of auckland
5938076 new zealand needs world class port infrastructure and a logical approach to future investment in the port and intermodal sectors
5938077 a rough and ready calculation would suggest that port of taurangas container business would be worth substantially more than ports of aucklands container business

5938177 if it was felt that it was most unlikely that you would be caught and punished then that would be an encouragement for the crime to be committed

5938188 we completely lost the media war both in the west and at home
5938189 the war in south ossetia and the way it was reflected in the statements of western leaders and the leading mass media publications exposed the genuine attitude of the west toward russia the opponents of our country took advantage of the humanitarian catastrophe in ossetia to launch a massive anti russian campaign
5938190 this is all a conspiracy against russia it became clear to me back on aug 8 that this is a war between russia and the united states and that it will be very bloody the u s a incites other countries into making loud statements about russia they want to fool their countrymen who dont like russians and they want to rally more allies against russia

5938210 if theres a problem with the book you got to go to the principal and say i want to exercise my right to another option

5938217 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5938218 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5938219 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5938220 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5938221 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5938222 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5938223 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5938224 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5938226 hes been really good for us this year and everything was clicking for him tonight
5938227 we just got to watch him harden keep him fresh and keep him strong
5938228 this kid is a competitor he pitches with confidence and hes done a real nice job here obviously
5938229 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5938230 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5938231 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5938232 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5938233 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5938234 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5938235 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5938236 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5938237 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5938238 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5938239 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5938240 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5938241 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5938242 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5938243 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5938244 who are open to doing something on the production side
5938245 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5938246 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5938247 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5938248 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5938249 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5938250 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5938251 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5938252 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5938253 let me be very clear this was not an investigation focused on lying about sex gary browns harold nelthorpes and walter harriss lives and careers were forever changed they were ruined financially and their reputations were completely destroyed because they chose to be dutiful police officers the public trust was violated this investigation is about whether public dollars were used unlawfully and more
5938254 our investigation has clearly shown that public dollars were used peoples lives were ruined the justice system was severely mocked and the public trust trampled on this case is about as far from being a private matter as one can get
5938255 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5938256 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5938257 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5938258 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5938259 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5938260 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5938261 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5938262 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5938263 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5938264 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5938265 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5938266 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5938267 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5938268 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5938269 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5938270 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5938271 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5938272 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5938273 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5938274 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5938275 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5938276 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5938277 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5938278 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5938279 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5938280 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5938281 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5938282 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5938283 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5938284 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5938285 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5938286 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5938287 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5938288 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5938289 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5938290 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5938291 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5938292 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5938293 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5938294 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5938295 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5938296 its in honor of sean and everything he represented everything he did

5938299 what happened to her did not have anything to do with my brothers death and no one who was there got to come in and testify against her
5938300 we do not for a moment discount the tragedy that was alonzo de la torres death
5938301 unfortunately under the circumstances of this situation this was the most serious charge we could have filed and we obtained the maximum sentence
5938302 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5938303 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5938304 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5938307 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5938308 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5938309 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5938310 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5938311 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5938312 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5938320 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
5938321 i am sorry for what i did that 25 year old man i dont think he appreciated the life he was taking that this was a human being
5938322 i feel now at 53 that i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5938323 for my consciences sake i felt the lord had told me to plead guilty at that time and i did
5938324 i had been going through some problems and was very confused and was feeling like a big nothing and a nobody
5938325 it was more about me and not him i was probably mad at myself for my failures
5938326 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
5938327 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5938328 the urges built again about doing this and then i flew back on dec 6 and on the 8th i shot mr lennon

5938360 a sudden stop on the earths surface could result in a bone shattering crash this is certainly not the result he is hoping to achieve but it is always a possibility
5938361 all that day crash was the talk of the show
5938362 i get to the show and all the monster truck guys tell me they dropped a car earlier in the day and the motor smacked through the dashboard into the back seat and if a person was in it that person would have been smashed i called
5938363 well crash wants no part of that he wants to do it the european way with the full car as it is now everyone is real scared crash seems scared but in a good mood at times flapping his arms like a butterfly well we know what crash thinks about butterflies he thinks it means eternal life
5938364 so im not sure if he knows hes going to make it or if he feels he wants to move on and be somewhere else crash has had a hard time of life the last few months and he has seemed different to many people
5938365 but if you know crash he needs it to go and he would have been mad as hell if he was stopped
5938366 before the firemen give the crane operator the go ahead i lean in and tell crash
5938367 i really felt there was a 50 50 chance he was going to get hurt or be killed so the car goes up and seems to take a long time i cant take it anymore so i turn away and hear the system release and crash explosion
5938368 everyone runs in the car lands perfect on its nose firemen and crew are trying to get to him and we are not sure if hes alright

5938383 there are several issues both that the elgin families who filed the lawsuit have and we have here
5938384 we have complained for 20 plus years about our kids being bused all over the district about crowded classrooms and certainly we have had our share of mobile units our issues kind of parallel theirs
5938385 we would say that these things are happening because of the districts size
5938386 and to that point had the district been smaller and less bureaucratic many of those issues would not have arisen
5938387 its a districtwide issue the size of enrollment and the physical size of the district its almost impossible to meet everyones needs
5938388 theyve got a program its working well but its a large district and they feel that they have to treat everyone the same as a consequence where good programs arent the same you have to get rid of them the point is one size cant always fit all
5938389 it would be hard to imagine a scenario where bartlett disconnecting would not impact the rights of the 17 000 or more class members

5938462 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5938463 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5938464 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
5938465 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function

5938468 this workshop is an opportunity for workers from mainstream organisations to carefully reflect on how their services are organised and delivered and how they can work better with aboriginal people
5938469 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5938470 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5938471 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5938472 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5938473 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions says dr fauci

5938484 the ministry will be tough with offenders through its offices which will conduct inspections across the country
5938485 the gap were having now in population growth is larger than it has ever been
5938486 royal jet has strong ambitions to grow throughout the region and we have therefore decided to level the playing field so that people throughout the gcc can take advantage of our leading product at an extremely competitive price
5938487 and so we are now expecting a surge in bookings from across the gcc
5938488 if a client wanted to fly on one of our boeing business jets from jeddah to geneva for instance it will now cost approximately 20 percent less than before since the positioning sector will not be included in the calculation of the overall cost

5938497 our tourism division etihad holidays is working out the tour packages with ktdc
5938498 we have started our services to three destinations in kerala in the last 14 months this shows the importance we attach to this region
5938499 the flights are operating with a load factor of 80 90 percent
5938500 many foreign tourists who come to thiruvananthapuram travel north and catch their return flight from kochi flight connectivity in kozhikode will change this trend and tourists will be encouraged to travel further north to malabar as they can catch their return flight from kozhikode

5938502 supplies were disrupted to the entire jammu and kashmir just not the valley
5938503 the state has 22 districts of which the 10 in jammu and two in the ladakh region were equally affected
5938504 around 2 800 trucks carrying essential commodities like fuel and medicine have come to the valley
5938505 around 3 300 fruit and vegetable laden trucks left the valley during the same period for different parts of north india
5938506 some disruption on the jammu srinagar national highway otherwise we used to get 1 000 trucks per day going to the valley
5938507 my vehicle was stoned and i saved myself by ducking
5938508 we were carrying supplies for them and they beat us up
5938509 even now if they call it an economic blockade and fuel the fire in kashmir on a non issue this is the most unfortunate thing to happen
5938510 the world has been seeing and reporting the economic blockade enforced by the extremist forces in jammu against the valley people it was their frustrations and they cannot deny what is the writing on the wall
5938511 we are one of the luckiest countries where we have plenty of sunshine throughout the year with this solar energy we can fulfil the energy needs of the whole world if we harness it in proper channel
5938512 we are doing remarkably well in generating power from renewable resources as we are at the fourth spot after germany spain and the us in harnessing the wind energy but still there is much more potential that goes unused
5938513 we are in a process to establish a solar thermal energy project at nagpur in maharashtra which will be the asias biggest solar power generation project we will also establish many special economic zones sezs exclusively for renewable projects at various locations of the country

5938517 toms role in tropic thunder is a small part but its funny
5938518 if youre trying to improve your image you want to get attention but you want to stay in the realm of eliciting a positive reaction for tom this role takes us back to what made him a superstar in the first place it reminded us that he can act

5938520 you support a fantastically well run event have a superb time at a five star resort and meet great people at the end of the day people who may otherwise never get the chance receive the gift of college through scholarship money raised at the event its a sure thing investment and the dividends pay out for life
5938521 if anyone got on he was going to be in the game
5938522 it was very similar to the groin strain i had in may it was something i felt like i could pitch through youre accepting responsibility when you take the mound at full speed or half speed and thats why i never wanted to make a big deal about it if it was significant enough to make a big deal about i should take myself out of the game
5938523 the past 10 days or so he feels back in line toward home plate
5938524 hes on top of the ball a little more he has good bite on his breaking ball and hes keeping his arm and his hand up
5938525 what happened to her did not have anything to do with my brothers death and no one who was there got to come in and testify against her
5938526 we do not for a moment discount the tragedy that was alonzo de la torres death
5938527 unfortunately under the circumstances of this situation this was the most serious charge we could have filed and we obtained the maximum sentence
5938528 i was very hesitant about getting back into local politics
5938529 theres plenty of time and campaigning really hasnt started yet
5938530 i was nervous because i had the ticket but am still in shock
5938531 wed like to congratulate the lake family for being the winning seat holder through our daily herald grand slam inning
5938532 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5938533 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5938534 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5938535 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5938536 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5938537 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5938538 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5938539 we had some opportunities and matsuzaka made some big pitches and got out of them
5938540 but we hung in there the best we could when your teams playing good everything seems to go your way and when its not going your way it seems like guys out in the field got extra gloves on
5938541 we had the right guys up there and it didnt happen
5938542 now that you said it i think someones going to get that hit
5938543 it doesnt matter whether the bases are loaded or not my job is to not allow the runners to score if theres a base empty of course its a little easier but its not something i worry about
5938544 we may end up discussing what we want to do about blocking mailboxes and looking at the fine structures if this thing continues to go on to the degree that it has
5938545 i would like to think it is over with but when we bring the mother lode out there this week
5938546 she was in what i call a tripod position with her head down and she started crying
5938547 after about 15 30 seconds she looked up and said i hurt that child
5938548 if you compare the written statement its about 99 percent word for word of your notes correct
5938549 if someone had done a rush on that we may have wound up going in the wrong direction
5938550 i want to see it broadened and also identify things we need at st james to make it accessible for everyone
5938551 most of these groups plan their events a year in advance
5938552 if were going to have special events we need to get the word out that were available
5938553 there are enough people who have a special interest in seeing st james flourish that we dont need to go into the districts coffers
5938554 as a couple both share teach and volunteer their time to motivate by example
5938555 im not surprised the wittkamps won the community leadership award because theyve been consistent and persistent torchbearers for physical fitness not only appealing to the younger generation but to the 50 plus
5938556 it was during the second world war when womens softball became popular
5938557 my dad took me to try out for a semiprofessional team but then he thought i was too young to travel so i declined
5938558 in the late 40s and mid 50s it was not considered feminine
5938559 we visited senior groups to find out what activities they enjoy and then reported back to the park district
5938560 then we tried to implement the programs with some help
5938561 passion for bringing seniors together for a new beginning socially and informing seniors about healthy activities
5938562 lollie walks the walk and talks the talk she began exercising at the age of 5 and is still igniting static electricity in the lives of many encouraging them to get fit
5938563 some friends came to me and said lollie youre going to run and i did and i love it
5938564 one thing near and dear to me is i would like to have a 50 and over coed soccer league
5938565 its on paper now so its just a matter of coordinating it with other park district programs
5938566 i think well take the gold in the 75 and over
5938567 when they would tar the roads wed ask them to put some down to mark our bases
5938568 i think i received it from a culmination of a lifetime of physical activity
5938569 all the while i was enjoying it i didnt realize i was becoming a role model
5938570 change perceptions about citgo among opinion leaders across the country
5938571 it was the only instance in my roman catholic life that ive considered suicide
5938572 we saw the flashing lights and all the people the cop cars and the paddy wagon
5938573 i wanted to stay clear of it to get away as fast as i can
5938574 theyd fired tear gas because the crowd was throwing things like rocks and bags of feces
5938575 suddenly this great cloud of gas rolled over the car
5938576 i saw cars pulled over to the side there was one cadillac with an elderly couple getting rid of their evening meal
5938577 that was the spooky part seeing people you know getting pushed around
5938578 i never met a policeman who went out of the way to harm someone
5938579 from my perspective if the crowd had listened to orders and obeyed the law there would have been no confrontation the crowd was not an orderly crowd
5938580 it was a matter of male ego in my opinion
5938581 if daley had not elected to clear out the parks at 11 p m you wouldnt have had a street fight at the convention
5938582 i told him senator i just came here to be appointed not ordained
5938583 they voted me the only guy they trusted over 30
5938584 the war being fought now doesnt have a draft associated with it
5938585 its the draft that made all the difference these people had friends in vietnam
5938586 it was a close to a nervous breakdown those kids were distraught
5938587 the people at the rally felt very strongly about what the war was doing to the people of vietnam but also to the people of this country
5938588 the police formed a v wedge through the middle of the crowd no one had any idea they were coming through they were just listening to the speakers
5938589 i think i was shocked the city and state would go to such extremes to stop what was for the most part a peaceful organization
5938590 at the end of the day i felt very demoralized
5938591 and felt change was much further off than i expected i think there were more tears in my eyes because of what i saw than what the mace caused
5938592 i was hoping hed get a hit in the last inning so i could start with ichiro suzuki
5938593 they gave us a script of highlights and we could read or ad lib
5938594 but no amount of practice can prepare you for this
5938595 its in honor of sean and everything he represented everything he did
5938596 friends and family can sum up sean in one word heart a kind caring and passionate young man sean gave it all on the field and gave of himself to help others at every turn
5938597 healing the shattered soul restoring hope to those impacted by trauma
5938598 its still a reminder on his paychecks of what he did and his employers are going to know why he has garnishments
5938599 between constant bouts of pneumonia and infections he gets hes got to be monitored 24 hours a day
5938600 he can be fine one day and wake up the next with something wrong
5938601 we wanted his matts life altered like he altered kyles
5938602 the colors are wonderful and the field just looks terrific
5938603 we got some finishing touches but we are going to get it cleaned up in time for the first game
5938604 they really do help make that stadium a better facility
5938605 we have some nice things planned to really play this up
5938606 are we european in mentality in interest in values are we the great power or which power indicates us
5938607 we have been looking for ways to get involved in pingree grove and to let the residents know that we want to bring events to their growing community
5938608 when claire unabia and lauren utter and katarzyna dolinska got kicked off i was just like this whole thing is a joke
5938609 they look like models if this supposed to be a modeling competition one of them should have won or anya kop should have won but it goes to show you that it might be about politics
5938610 whitney took great pictures and she definitely knows how to conduct herself shes very outspoken and she speaks really well
5938611 i think thats why she won over anya otherwise i wanted anya to win anya has that high fashion look and she really knows how to model but she lacks the confidence and speech skills that whitney has
5938612 to be quite honest whitney doesnt look like a plus sized model to me
5938613 but honestly i think its about time if thats what it takes to change the face of fashion than thats a tiny step hopefully we will have another woman who represents a larger portion of american plus size models
5938614 for me its really exciting because its great to work with an artist that wants to be more creative and more fashion forward thats why i love her i mean how fabulous is she

5938616 its only by gods grace that the victim wasnt killed
5938617 im not saying i shouldnt be punished for my actions
5938618 cook county has been the worst experience of my life
5938619 i thought i was invincible in two years ive seen im not
5938620 i think the sentence was way too much considering the victim did not pick him out of a lineup
5938621 there are several issues both that the elgin families who filed the lawsuit have and we have here
5938622 we have complained for 20 plus years about our kids being bused all over the district about crowded classrooms and certainly we have had our share of mobile units our issues kind of parallel theirs
5938623 we would say that these things are happening because of the districts size
5938624 and to that point had the district been smaller and less bureaucratic many of those issues would not have arisen
5938625 its a districtwide issue the size of enrollment and the physical size of the district its almost impossible to meet everyones needs
5938626 theyve got a program its working well but its a large district and they feel that they have to treat everyone the same as a consequence where good programs arent the same you have to get rid of them the point is one size cant always fit all
5938627 it would be hard to imagine a scenario where bartlett disconnecting would not impact the rights of the 17 000 or more class members
5938628 the court at some level would have to review any attempt by bartlett or any other community to try to disconnect at this point
5938629 every night at least one person tells me how beautiful my yard is
5938630 were trying to accommodate those families who request to attend our schools but are nonresidents
5938631 we have been declining in students so we have the space to accommodate additional students
5938632 i dont want to open our district up to people who are having problems and will be a problem for our teachers and students
5938633 so is this going to have a major influx of students in our district
5938634 its certainly a small accommodation that we could possibly make for those few families who have requested to come in the district but dont reside here
5938635 the mayors taskforce on opportunities for minorities and women is charged with identifying root causes as opposed to symptoms and recommending solutions that will increase the competitive participation in city contracting of companies that are reflective of our diverse community
5938636 we want to get something in the ground as soon as possible

5938640 were just calling it our flexible corn boil because everything changes daily
5938641 i am looking forward to meeting with employees today and growers during the two week roadshow starting on monday to outline the particular perspective i will bring as chairman being initially from outside the kiwifruit industry
5938642 clearly hosting the event has delivered economically in year one more importantly though the data from the survey gives us reassurance that these benefits will continue for years to come
5938643 there is still a lot of work to do and this is the next step in getting the roads to someplace thats more of a maintenance role
5938644 this is the next step in getting the streets up to world class condition
5938645 it will be a challenge for the audit and finance commission and this board to pay down the bond
5938646 its unfortunate were talking about both these issues the same night
5938647 but we have to pass the pay ordinance 180 days before the election
5938648 i spend about a fifth of my week on village business
5938649 its time consuming im not recommending the position be full time but someday that may have to change
5938650 i think that just shows that this village even despite the fact that were in a horrible economy weve still got a very good community to offer and were very excited that the businesses are still willing to make the investment in our community
5938651 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5938652 my concern is i dont see any benefit to myself
5938653 he wants the benefits of the community without being in the community
5938654 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5938655 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5938656 its just a matter of taking advantage of the low interest rates now and doing more of the roadwork earlier than later
5938657 the goal would be to make sure all our streets are maintained on a more regular basis
5938658 weve got five years from the time the referendum is approved to issue all of the bonds
5938659 you can piecemeal it based on prudent fiscal planning so you dont have to borrow all of it
5938660 if you borrow it later you risk the interest rate escalating
5938661 a lot of times people say that they dont have a voice in their government
5938662 this is a time when they get to choose how the village moves forward
5938663 what were trying to do here is fix things that have never been fixed
5938664 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5938665 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5938666 randhurst reminds me of that new car you loved when it was new but as it aged and you had to put more money into it no matter how much you loved it there came a time to replace it
5938667 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5938668 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5938669 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5938670 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5938671 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5938672 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5938673 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5938674 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5938675 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5938676 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5938677 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5938678 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5938679 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5938680 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5938681 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5938682 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5938683 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5938684 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5938685 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5938686 its the same thing for teachers too its a sea of children youve never seen before
5938687 every year what i do in my room it is from scratch
5938688 you need a lot of color and a lot up on the walls
5938689 we have everything else but we needed to bring a white sock and a ruler sized pencil box
5938690 we make sure that we carry the things from the local schools
5938691 were ready for the crunch when they cant find it anywhere else theyll be here at 9 p m
5938692 im a bit uncomfortable that perhaps theyre biting off more than they can chew
5938693 we obviously dont want to get ourselves into a situation where we are way over our heads
5938694 i am honored and humbled by my appointment and will work hard to justify the supreme courts faith in me
5938695 while i recognize the significance of my elevation and my heritage i want ultimately to be remembered as a good judge for all the people
5938696 he has worked hard is very conscientious and will do a great job representing the hispanic community and all of lake county
5938697 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
5938698 but its a bad market we dont want to hit low bids
5938699 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
5938700 it certainly seems like if we could get some of these vehicles over here wed be headed in a better direction
5938701 its definitely nice to get into the vehicles and actually see them and drive
5938702 its been a rough three or four years as an employee with the restructuring
5938703 its time to tell the employees theres a reason to believe we have a future we really are doing great things
5938704 if the perception prevails out there then people are going to miss an opportunity to get a good value
5938705 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
5938706 the marketplace of ideas does not work when we have gag orders imposed on our scientists
5938707 las chances est n todas de nuestro lado y yo dir a que somos favoritos pero bueno uno sabe como es cuando se define todo en un solo partido pero creo que tenemos buenas posibilidades en el partido de ma ana
5938708 primero tenemos que pasar a grecia nosotros quer amos clasificar bien arriba para no cruzarnos en esta instancia ni con estados unidos ni con espa a y lo logramos
5938709 la verdad es que no los vi jugar en estos juegos ol mpicos pero s que son un equipo duro que traban los partidos y dif cil encontrar cosas claras contra ellos
5938710 son speros con buena talla y mucha experiencia pero tenemos muy buenas chances de pasar no en vano nosotros fuimos dos y ellos tres en su grupo
5938711 son un equipo sin grandes individualidades no tienen los jugadores esos que pueden crear un tiro en cualquier momento y desbordar por s mismos
5938712 vamos a tratar de interrumpirles su juego y su movilidad para lograr que esa peque a falencia que tienen pueda quedar en evidencia y as poder sacar provecho de eso
5938713 compartimos muchas cosas con los chicos de la delegaci n estoy m s metido en eso que en lo que pasa en argentina y creo que eso es bueno estar m s preocupados por nosotros mismos ya vamos a tener tiempo para los afectos y para estar junto a nuestras familias
5938714 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5938726 shanghai has proven to be a very emotional market and is likely to stay that way
5938727 it is too early for a fiscal stimulus package and we should be responsible about calling for one
5938728 there is still room for monetary policy before we try fiscal policy
5938729 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5938730 but what did he do in the end he dumped us and joined umno

5938732 we were chasing after that you hate to see it happen its real disappointing

5938734 just normal particularly when you have so many games things are going to happen
5938735 suspensions people are going to get injured theres all kinds of stuff i think that the only thing you know during the season is that there are going to be bumps and bumps of all kinds
5938736 it was just an amazing show we got to meet all the other u s athletes we met president bush we were able to take pictures with other athletes once we were in the stadium the lap around the stadium just representing the usa was amazing it gave me goose bumps

5938743 i wouldve thrown him out too he knows as soon as the game was over he said i cant do that and hes right he cant do that
5938744 theres improvement but hes not ready to play so well see
5938745 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it the guy who went 0 1 at the world championship just won the olympic title

5938793 a unique opportunity to reduce the massive housing lists around the country and house people who have been languishing on lists the longest
5938794 money is in short supply so to use it on a rent allowance rather than on the capital investment of a property now reduced by a quarter or third makes little sense financially and socially
5938795 also money used to adapt unsuitable social housing to the special needs of its occupants might be used to purchase a more suitable house for the residents where appropriate if we do this we may find that we can reduce the lists for both social and affordable housing more effectively in recession than in times of plenty
5938796 where builders are unable to sell even at reduced prices
5938797 there were no reports of attacks against critical infrastructure electronic jamming of stock exchanges scada hack explosions in substations or anything like that this was not a battalion of elite army trained hackers from the russian southern command of cyber warfare in all likelihood it was groups of run of the mill script kiddies with control of a botnet stroking their egos with the higher cause of injured nationalism
5938798 we are very impressed with the quality and standard of the designs received and we spent a whole day going through them and short listing them
5938799 it was intended to cut the list to four but this proved an impossible task due to the number we received so it was decided to broaden to eight
5938800 weve given them a timeframe of the middle of october and hope to have the monument in place before st patricks day next year

5938802 it was agreed by the committee that as it would be impossible to record the names of all of the dockers on the monument a parchment scroll would be an appropriate memorial

5938823 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5938824 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5938825 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5938826 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
5938827 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss
5938828 eles jogaram muito bem com um ritmo forte nem sempre a gente consegue fazer o nosso melhor hoje erramos bastante mais do que nos ltimos jogos

5938855 i think the sentence was way too much considering the victim did not pick him out of a lineup
5938856 as a couple both share teach and volunteer their time to motivate by example
5938857 im not surprised the wittkamps won the community leadership award because theyve been consistent and persistent torchbearers for physical fitness not only appealing to the younger generation but to the 50 plus
5938858 it was during the second world war when womens softball became popular
5938859 my dad took me to try out for a semiprofessional team but then he thought i was too young to travel so i declined
5938860 in the late 40s and mid 50s it was not considered feminine
5938861 we visited senior groups to find out what activities they enjoy and then reported back to the park district
5938862 then we tried to implement the programs with some help

5938864 lollie walks the walk and talks the talk she began exercising at the age of 5 and is still igniting static electricity in the lives of many encouraging them to get fit

5938866 one thing near and dear to me is i would like to have a 50 and over coed soccer league
5938867 its on paper now so its just a matter of coordinating it with other park district programs
5938868 i think well take the gold in the 75 and over
5938869 when they would tar the roads wed ask them to put some down to mark our bases
5938870 i think i received it from a culmination of a lifetime of physical activity
5938871 all the while i was enjoying it i didnt realize i was becoming a role model
5938872 we only have five or six guys that can drive
5938873 the biggest obstacle is having these kids who mostly have freshman experience none of these players will have varsity experience but they have worked hard
5938874 weve learned a lot and matured a lot from one year to the next
5938875 there are some leaders on this team who will take charge yes weve gotten stronger and gained some size and strength
5938876 we are going to be pretty much balanced with the run and pass
5938877 brown is the speedster of the two and is one of the faster guys on the team blackshire has good vision and a lot of power he is very elusive
5938878 hes accepted that role and is one of the hardest working kids who leads by example darian is real smart and can handle a lot for his age
5938879 marcus just turned 15 and is very versatile because he can play any of the skill positions
5938880 gauthier is about 6 foot 3 with decent speed but is elusive for a tall kid he is a combination of football and basketball
5938881 both aaron and eric started every game last year and those two guys will be important for our offensive line
5938882 he is like our quarterback on defense because he makes all the calls
5938883 robert seals is a young defensive lineman who is 6 foot 3 about 220 pounds he has good size and runs well plus hes only a sophomore
5938884 he is versatile and will also see action on offense
5938885 caleb is a good return guy and is a pretty smart decent athlete who is going to help us
5938886 i know in some games we are going to be outmatched but our goal is to be competitive but we have to give ourselves some of those opportunities to win some of those games
5938887 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
5938888 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
5938889 multiple 000 calls were received as three crews from hobart and glenorchy fire brigades arrived to find the rear of the building fully involved in fire mr tavasz said
5938890 this investment is the start of a new model for business continuity
5938891 from a competitive standpoint this is absolutely where the market is headed
5938892 going to be the trust issue are you going to let i b m or any other company hold your data
5938893 we knew they were a good team and it was a pitching battle there for a while
5938894 but their pitcher tyler hermann kept us off guard and we had that one bad inning when you play a team like that it is going to cost you
5938895 brandon was doing a good job until that mental mistake
5938896 id say that was the turning point but it still didnt hurt us that much in defense for jorge i dont think hes had an interference called on him all year it was a foul tip and the bat just hit the glove
5938897 of course we also had another couple of mistakes in that inning including one where we werent covering the bag properly and these were just routine things that the guys know about
5938898 i told them before the ball game that we needed three more wins to clinch this championship
5938899 it was really a lot more than we ever expected
5938900 not many teams just starting out go to nationals a lot of people thought as a first year team going we were going to lose a lot but once the girls got there they had nothing to lose and gave it all they had
5938901 it was a great accomplishment for the team and for the boys
5938902 like i told my kids that was the best vacation ive ever had
5938903 its something we never even thought of doing all we wanted to do was beat lamar in the playoffs but we kept winning and winning and all of a sudden were playing 50 miles away from canada in the world series
5938904 sorry but i dont have any appointments before 3 pm
5938905 you can argue with a no but you cant argue with a maybe
5938906 i want to assure you that i put cutting hair above everything else
5938907 in fact when a realty meeting got cancelled today the first thing i did was come here
5938908 i have a client who is a graduate student and i only charge him 35
5938909 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5938910 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5938911 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
5938912 we are interested in the design thinking method of innovation which has been successfully taught at both institutions through joint scientific research projects we want to find out which factors ultimately contribute to the success of this kind of engineered and creative development of innovation for all areas of life
5938913 the time is right to apply rigorous academic research to understand how when and why design thinking works to accelerate human centered innovation
5938914 it is time to create the next generation design thinking methodology and supporting technology and we appreciate professor plattners support of this endeavour
5938915 right now theyre just having to buckle down and figure out how to compete against wal mart in a slowing market
5938916 we turned on a dime from a double digit growth environment to a no growth environment

5938918 ipg is working very hard to change its cost structure and they are making some amount of progress
5938919 the ability to attract women voters is always an uphill battle for republicans
5938920 is at risk of falling below gop candidate bob doles 38 percent share of the womens vote in 1996
5938921 having surrogates like her are helpful but they are not going to turn the race around
5938922 it is not going to all of a sudden make women turn around and say because she is out there im going to vote for mccain
5938923 women voters dont trust mccain because of his extreme views on issues they care about
5938924 women want change from eight years of neglect for americas middle class families and womens economic security
5938925 i spend a lot of time talking to women i find women are very receptive to john mccain they respect his integrity his character and his service
5938926 women will look at the totality of the two men not single issues
5938927 most corporations have two options they can go to the bank market or the us private placement market said mark garrick managing director global head of capital markets origination at nab
5938928 right now there is greater reliance on the bank market to deal with corporates and their refinancing challenges said chris champion managing director at goldman sachs jbwere
5938929 the loan market is still active and deals are getting done said gavin chappell director of debt capital markets in the loan division at westpac
5938930 well start to see a slow increase in the number of m amp a deals in 2009 mr chappell said
5938931 why would a fund manager buy a bbb rated corporate name at 150 basis points over the bank bill swap rate bbsw when he can pick up an australian major bank subordinated debt rated five notches higher at 180 bps over bbsw mr garrick said
5938932 i dont expect any corporate bond issuance in australia in the near to medium term including 2009 said craig saalmann credit strategist at jpmorgan citing the pricing difference as one of the reasons

5938946 commodore bainimarama agreed with and accepted the seven point communiqu on fiji and so told all the leaders present at the retreat
5938947 sir michael somare and i certainly did not pressure him into making those commitments to have elections next march as we and all the leaders are keen on helping fiji move forward but fiji has to play its due part
5938948 there is no question as the report is a good one and no doubt the leaders will support it
5938949 it has been a very busy year for us from the trigo fire to the big spring fire even this past weekend there was the flooding here in albuquerque and the tornadic winds in socorro we had a mobile home blow over
5938950 i cant seem to motivate myself i know i can improve my fitness and my ability in sport but i cant seem to get there what can i do
5938951 randhurst reminds me of that new car you loved when it was new but as it aged and you had to put more money into it no matter how much you loved it there came a time to replace it
5938952 i can do all things through him who strengthens me
5938953 for by you i can run against a troop and by my god i can leap over a wall
5938954 with man this salvation is impossible but with god all things are possible
5938955 if you are not playing then you are never happy thats normal
5938956 im a centre half but as long as you are playing that is the most important thing
5938957 taking away the positives we can say that the new boys especially gio and luka would have learnt a lot from that game they are quality players so i am sure they will get to grips with the english style of football very quickly
5938958 we were not the best team in the world after beating roma 5 0 and we are certainly not the worst now
5938959 its disappointing that crouchie isnt in the england squad i was surprised but theres not a lot i can do because i dont pick the squad
5938960 our position was there was no attempt to hide assets and the documentation will show that
5938961 when you look into the whole thing its not suspicious at all
5938962 be vindicated of any criminal conduct in this tragic accident
5938963 we were concerned that mr lapointe appeared to be under insured and appeared to be conveying assets in a way that might frustrate my clients and the other familys ability to recover in this case
5938964 it may be the right thing to do to move the body shop
5938965 its an extraordinarily expensive endeavor already but i will explore the possibility of what it will cost to maybe put the body shop at the other location
5938966 because of the topography and everything weve offered to put a check valve into the property
5938967 so if there was ever a blockage again and the pressure was looking for somewhere to go it would release to the manhole
5938968 its not often you see people that dont have to do the right thing doing the right thing
5938969 reasonably refused to participate and object to the dangerous activity
5938970 you have a guy whos tremendously excited about this position and being here and having the opportunity to coach framingham girls soccer it exudes its coming out of his pores
5938971 so this i thought would be a nice way to give back something to framingham after all it has given to me through the years through soccer i think that would be a good thing
5938972 its a steep learning for him especially considering the situation were in at the moment
5938973 in an ideal world i wouldnt be playing in central midfield weve had a couple of injuries and weve had to deal with the situation we are in at the moment
5938974 so it was hard for jack in the first half but in the second half i thought he grew into the game
5938975 its been 17 months now and there were times when i felt like i was never going to be fit hopefully ive got all my injuries out of the way and now im really looking forward to getting on with the season
5938976 its just been one injury problem after another and even when i felt i was getting close towards the end of last season there were constant little niggles that slowed me down now fingers crossed i can stay fit
5938977 i think im definitely mentally stronger after all the problems ive had and hopefully that can hold me in good stead for the rest of my career i really cant wait for the start of the season i just want to keep pushing now
5938978 a lot of things have changed since i first got injured but i just really have to worry about myself i want to remind people what i can do i want to prove a point and ill see how it goes
5938979 id like to think ill be in contention for the first game of the season
5938980 jonas played very well although it was a team effort
5938981 all of the players did fantastically well but we are all pleased for jonas because he is playing in a new league and a new country
5938982 the premier league is not like serie a or la liga it is much faster and jonas and fabricio coloccini did very well on their debuts
5938983 what were going to do today will translate into a billion dollars or more off of next years deficit so i think thats a significant start
5938984 im asking them to do something thats unprecedented to go into an existing budget and to cut it without taxes
5938985 if they dont reach the 600million and further losses in revenue create a situation where we come back in deficit they are mandated by law to come back
5938986 if you cut now and you dont secure an additional revenue stream were going to have to continue to cut and sacrifice core programs
5938987 any mug can go and buy loads of players for 20m or 30m my missus could go and buy kaka
5938988 we could all buy the best players in the world if we had an open chequebook but its called managing i have to manage this football club i love looking around for loans i enjoy that side of the job and i love that part of the game
5938989 so i will beg borrow and steal one or two bodies who might do well for us
5938990 there are several issues both that the elgin families who filed the lawsuit have and we have here
5938991 we have complained for 20 plus years about our kids being bused all over the district about crowded classrooms and certainly we have had our share of mobile units our issues kind of parallel theirs
5938992 we would say that these things are happening because of the districts size
5938993 and to that point had the district been smaller and less bureaucratic many of those issues would not have arisen
5938994 its a districtwide issue the size of enrollment and the physical size of the district its almost impossible to meet everyones needs
5938995 theyve got a program its working well but its a large district and they feel that they have to treat everyone the same as a consequence where good programs arent the same you have to get rid of them the point is one size cant always fit all
5938996 it would be hard to imagine a scenario where bartlett disconnecting would not impact the rights of the 17 000 or more class members
5938997 the court at some level would have to review any attempt by bartlett or any other community to try to disconnect at this point
5938998 yes mr doom that is acceptable you see most death penalty victims are guilty of something even if the evidence is lacking as are the many war casualties that we allow as collateral damage so do not worry your vote for president bush will not count against you in the eyes of jesus you did vote for him yes
5938999 oh mr doom this too is acceptable if you are a catholic the faggots will burn but our brothers and sisters of the church will be escorted by angel driven golf carts to their proper eternal rest
5939000 every night at least one person tells me how beautiful my yard is
5939001 dof up to the early 1980s was under the erstwhile trade and industry ministry and giving out mine and quarry leases but this right was taken over by the department of industry after dof was transferred to the agriculture ministry
5939002 these mines under dgm have to seek a tri level approval from dgm local government and nec they have a detailed mine plan and environment plan for planned mining that does not affect local health community and environment and undergo strict monitoring
5939003 this too is a temporary measure because of the lack of dgm manpower and were looking to handover this responsibility to dgm too
5939004 were transferring the mines because dgm is the sole authority and has technical skills while our function is conservation of nature and wildlife
5939005 romanian firefighters could not get their trucks close enough to a burning building so they put out the fire by throwing snowballs at it
5939006 when the constitution has conferred powers for all the appellate and other cases it will be difficult without a supreme court
5939007 for the supreme court were technically prepared in terms of human resources and even how the how the cases will be heard and court proceedings are ready
5939008 we dont have to wait for the structure to be ready
5939009 we have qualified people and numerically were all right however the appointment has not been done for administrative reasons
5939010 there were many good singers from other dzongkhags but they couldnt sing all three types of song
5939011 i dont know how the other viewers especially those who are uneducated will be able to support their favourite without proper instruction on how to vote
5939012 not many days after the dialysis she has to come back with fluid overload in her body
5939013 the number of patients will increase and we need more machines and more trained staff
5939014 this is part of the governments initiative to support and regulate the market it will boost investor confidence
5939015 it is a positive development and demonstrates that the government wants to regulate and improve the business practices in the market
5939016 we have been maintaining the best practices in lending we make sure that the developer is good serious and has financial capability to build the project while the borrower has the repayment capacity
5939017 the mortgage law just reiterates the best practices im happy that it has been issued
5939018 it will definitely boost investor confidence in dubais property market more and more banks will now enter the mortgage market with renewed confidence as the law streamlines procedures
5939019 we also expect the mortgage rates to come down to a better and more competitive level
5939020 all property mortgage contracts must be registered with the land department otherwise they will be considered invalid
5939021 over half of all nhs prescriptions issued in scotland are now sent electronically latest figures show since the start of electronic transfer of prescriptions etp in scotland in january 2008 7 72 million prescriptions have been sent electronically in july this figure reached 1 955 million more than 50 of all the prescriptions issued
5939022 in many ways carers become prisoners in their own homes
5939023 its not uncommon to come across parents whose child was 50 and had never spent a day away in all their lives
5939024 nothings changed in the health of our sons yet we still have to fill in the same forms
5939025 its a sadness that our sons are disabled and then its an anger that weve got fill them in again and again
5939026 there needs to be more recognition of the value these carers have
5939027 for carers not to be truly understood and valued is an issue the government takes a long hard look at
5939028 families must be encouraged and supported rather than ignored considered troublesome or deliberately excluded
5939029 agencies that arent paying competitive wage increases are losing staff to agencies which are near the top of the pay pile
5939030 that has a compound effect on the cost for the losing agency
5939031 so if youre on the bottom of the pay pile because you dont have funding sufficient to meet wage increases and youre churning staff your resources are continually being dragged into paying your advertising and recruitment costs
5939032 it just puts you further and further behind the eight ball
5939033 i guarantee that if you put a group of centrelink workers into an office perhaps here in canberra for a day or two they could come up with pages and pages of ways that greater efficiencies could be made which didnt have the deleterious effects that we believe the current funding arrangements have
5939034 the shit that happened to my children im going to get each and everyone of youse f ers back
5939035 my children are having nightmares and each and every person is going to suffer the same shit
5939036 if i see you come near my house again im going to f ing shoot you
5939037 im not going to be taken lightly you know who this is
5939038 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5939039 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5939040 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5939041 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5939042 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information
5939043 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5939044 avec ces nouveaux prix nous aurions int r t garder les centrales que nous construisons et les exploiter nous m mes pour vendre le courant ce tarif
5939045 nracs national rural advisory council recommendation to the minister i dont believe we can blame the minister on this issue its more nracs position on the declarations here in victoria
5939046 saya sangat senang bisa bergabung dengan psg sebab klub ini adalah impian saya sejak masih kanak kanak
5939047 psg merupakan klub besar yang sukses melahirkan beberapa pemain top macam jay jay okocha ronaldinho serta rai
5939048 the colors are wonderful and the field just looks terrific
5939049 we got some finishing touches but we are going to get it cleaned up in time for the first game
5939050 they really do help make that stadium a better facility
5939051 we have some nice things planned to really play this up
5939052 tom is a very exciting player he scores goals and is a good crosser of the ball technically he is very good he is a left sided player with an excellent left foot and he can also play on the right wing and up front if needed we think he is going to be a decent player
5939053 he does a bit of everything he can win the ball distribute it well a good range of creative passing and he has a hell of a shot on him
5939054 i really enjoyed my time working with phil brown last season i never really got the chance to say thanks for last season because everything happened so quickly but i think he knows how grateful i am for what he did
5939055 my game came on leaps and bounds last year and hull did me all sorts of favours i left a completely different player from when i came better in every way
5939056 hes had one or two injury problems over the last year or two and so we need to check everything is ok
5939057 its a real shame because alan isnt just a great pro and a terrific player but a leader and a great human being
5939058 hes had a magnificent career and has every reason to be immensely proud of what hes achieved in the game especially considering some of the adversity hes had to overcome
5939059 we knew john was interested in the coaching side and wed love to have him on board
5939060 he has vast experience and it would be great to bring in someone of his calibre
5939061 his work and family commitments would restrict it to one day a week but the young players will learn a lot
5939062 hopefully they can do some finishing exercises and benefit from a guy whose goal record and movement was fantastic
5939063 their lives would not be safe for five years to come
5939064 its got a great school system its a very accepting community and its a beautiful community its a community you might see somewhere a lot farther than 12 miles from boston its got a very rural feel and its just a beautiful town
5939065 it took me five years to get to the premier league after i left aston villa so it was a great day for me made even better by our first win in the top flight
5939066 this is a different challenge for me at this level and it will be a magnificent achievement if the club can continue to build in the way it has done over the time i have been at hull
5939067 you never know how far we can go but we showed again on saturday the character that has taken us to the top level if we keep that we may well be good enough to stay up
5939068 since i have been at hull a lot has changed a new stadium several managers and now we are in the premier league
5939069 certainly being in the wales squad has helped my development and everything that has happened to me in the last year or so has been a great experience
5939070 maybe when i left villa i could not have envisaged where i am now
5939071 these are some of the major motivations norwood has moving forward with the model schools program
5939072 our hope is to be under construction by next spring or summer
5939073 shanghai has proven to be a very emotional market and is likely to stay that way
5939074 there is still room for monetary policy before we try have been struggling to balance concerns about rapidly slowing growth rates around the world with persistent inflation
5939075 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5939076 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
5939077 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
5939078 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5939079 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5939080 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5939081 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5939082 i wanted so much to do well for the people of china their support helped me so much and i hope i made them proud
5939083 four years ago i had perfect preparation i was injury free and i felt great
5939084 this time i had to fight myself out of a ginormous hole this silver medal is gold for me
5939085 am i tired of sixth i dont look at it that way
5939086 no its not the placement i wanted but i went all out
5939087 the only time i missed it was during the meet all of them were over rotated i just couldnt correct that
5939088 i looked around at all my teammates eyes thats what we do we play great defense
5939089 lets just say none of us are doing this for the money said center forward kami craig
5939090 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
5939091 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me
5939092 it happened so quick its just kind of a shock to me and its something ill deal with
5939093 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter
5939094 once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
5939095 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
5939096 my goal is different we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
5939097 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
5939098 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me
5939099 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think the cowboys did that
5939100 playing australia gave us a chance to personally touch some of those players
5939101 how quick patrick mills was how really good david andersen is why hes one of the best players in europe how well chris anstey can still shoot
5939102 theyre a good team over the last three games averaging over 100 points a game 40 of those coming on threes so theyre shooting the heck out of the ball
5939103 the united states is the land of opportunity its the best country in the world and im just glad to represent it
5939104 who would have thought this could be possible for someone with my background but i set my goal i trained hard i just put the pieces together and i really believed in myself
5939105 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to go all the way
5939106 we always moved forward my mom always taught us to suck it up and whatever you want to do you can do
5939107 some people dont understand the sacrifice how much blood sweat and tears go into getting that gold
5939108 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment he came from
5939109 could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that
5939110 i need to finish a lot better than i did today i need to have a perfect race and probably a little luck
5939111 small business owners including firms not directly targeted by the mandate have been telling us that this mandate will be a hardship for their businesses and hinder their ability to create and retain jobs
5939112 this study is proof positive that the issue 4 is bad medicine for ohio
5939113 negotiate reductions in benefits with my employees to make up for the added burdens
5939114 applying these basic principles wont play out the same in every industry and at every business
5939115 but i think putting together a an increase in the frequency of performance reviews alongside b greater flexibility and freedom for employees makes sound economic sense
5939116 one of the time honored ways that big business fights any proposal it doesnt like is to trot out some phony set of numbers about how establishing a minimum wage or ending child labor or requiring brakes on cars or what have you will cost trillions and well all lose jobs and die horribly
5939117 the cold fact is that most middle class employees have had sick leave provision for years and wouldnt dream of not having it people get sick so do their kids the campaign against this is racist sexist class based and dishonest and the columbus dispatch editorial page should be ashamed of itself for its knee jerk support of its corporate buddies many poor people have no bargaining power at all a decent society looks out for their interests and that is what the people of ohio are about to do whether the greedheads like it or not
5939118 when i was a child i used to swim here
5939119 i liked it here it was very nice when we were kids here
5939120 just the fact that shes 90 and gets out here every day
5939121 we have to aim for the same again thats the very minimum thats required at a club like this
5939122 theres the premier league fa cup league cup and the champions league but this season weve also got the chance to win the uefa super cup and the fifa club world cup
5939123 well go for all of them of course but well need a little bit of luck along the way first and foremost it would be great to try and retain the two trophies weve just won but well have to wait and see
5939124 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream

5939130 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
5939131 theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again

5939149 in truth sir philip has never really been away simply because as life president he continued to aid and assist everyone at the club

5939164 i wasnt given any codes any procedures any supervision mr sanhueza told icac commissioner jerrold cripps qc today
5939165 bodgy prices a price to make up the numbers for his managers to compare with inflated quotes that he allegedly skimmed once work was completed
5939166 so the fire brigade was telling you to get up bodgy tenders
5939167 about 5 30 this morning i heard strange sounds on the outside of the hull of the boat i hadnt heard about colin so i was a bit unsure what was going on mr lewis told radio
5939168 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat he said
5939169 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
5939170 he went across to another boat that was moored adjacent to me and he was on that for about an hour then he seemed to get very tired and he almost beached himself and then he hooked on to a boat called javelin
5939171 he is spending more time on the surface his muscles are more relaxed
5939172 the question is the timing we want to do it promptly to minimise the stress
5939173 the best thing that can happen is that it joins a pod of whales and theres a female there that can look after it
5939174 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome
5939175 i havent had any sleep for the last three days im usually a mum but ive even abandoned my own kids these week
5939176 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5939177 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5939178 all your are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed
5939179 if the cit mutation had occurred first wouldnt we be calling the later potentiating mutation the cit mutation instead
5939180 eigentum und freiheit sind in gefahr so lange das parlament tagt
5939181 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone
5939182 so we decided to tighten things up completely to make sure there was no doubt
5939183 he has gone on record saying he doesnt want to be bothered basically he doesnt want the fame and publicity that comes with being the worlds tallest man
5939184 whether or not thats the real reason im not sure but thats what hes told us
5939185 need glory i just want a normal life under normal conditions
5939186 he was a bit of a recluse he looked after goats then the fame that he got from being a holder meant that he found himself a wife his life improved
5939187 how to make a living with your passion without getting a job
5939188 asian travel in the raw you need to subscribe to gain access
5939189 fred you have to come live here you can live like a king
5939190 if i was going to bring any friends with me
5939191 i suppose what we did learn on the weekend against north was regardless of playing in the eight that was the standard we have to match
5939192 and we could let ourselves down if we think thats it now the club cant make the eight and we put the cue in the rack thinking we have done a good job
5939193 this competition goes for 22 weeks and the standards we have set will have a big imprint on 2009 and you never want to leave a season regardless of whether you are going to play finals or not with a sour taste in your mouth and hopefully we dont
5939194 and i have seen it at our club before as a player where we have finished off a season well and translated it into the following season because it helps your belief over the pre season
5939195 but i can get cucumbers 3 1 at the grocery store you are charging too much

5939211 the operating environment during the next 12 months is expected to be the most challenging the virgin blue group which now comprises virgin blue pacific blue polynesian blue and v australia has experienced to date
5939212 key drivers for the rest of our business namely capacity demand and the cost of fuel remain highly volatile
5939213 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5939214 at the same time we will seek to deploy aircraft to more profitable routes or those where there is limited competition today

5939218 while there is undoubtedly a strong underlying demand for dwellings in australia as a result of rising population and a sustained under supply of new dwellings continuing high interest rates and low affordability will effectively cap demand
5939219 until economic conditions ease and constraints on new housing supply are addressed there is little prospect of any meaningful upturn in house building activity during the 2008 09 financial year with most forecasters predicting a continuation of the current flat demand
5939220 rising cost pressures both in australia and offshore will also impact on our cost base the effective management of price increases in the subdued domestic market will be essential to protect margins
5939221 against this challenging economic outlook management is certain the benefits of our extensive restructuring program will flow through during the new financial year
5939222 our large investment in innovative environmentally sustainable products also positions the company well to capitalize on changing consumer demands and government legislation
5939223 in the current economic environment the outlook for the 2008 09 financial year is difficult to assess
5939224 further market guidance for 2008 09 will be provided at the companys annual general meeting in october when we can make a more informed assessment of the market
5939225 interest rate reductions will in time boost confidence and then construction activity but thats a 2009 2010 story

5939228 the group has maintained its strong trading performance despite very poor conditions across the housing sector we are close to completing our two year re structuring program and improved supply chain management has resulted in lower inventory levels across all divisions
5939229 with very strong cash flows and the reduction in debt levels gwa is now in a position to capitalise on opportunities through both organic growth and acquisitions

5939303 he would still be alive he would be a little boy now
5939304 despite the fact that it ships with a dvd drive for whatever godforsaken reason the nintendo wii doesnt support dvd playback
5939305 there could never have been any doubt in his mind about how very much we all loved him
5939306 this proves that the united states has been and still is the best in womens gymnastics
5939307 nine years ago when i assumed the power of the country it was going to be declared a terrorist state and on the verge of being declared an economically failed state
5939308 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5939309 i conducted february 18 elections which were free and fair and power was transferred in an amicable manner this is the proof of my reconciliatory attitude
5939310 all my appeals for reconciliation and leaving the past behind failed
5939311 now they the ruling coalition want to impeach me why because they want to hide their mistakes
5939312 no charge sheet can stand against me no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5939313 this is not time for individual bravado it is time to think seriously with impeachment the countrys dignity will be undermined and as you all know pakistan is my love my life is ready to be sacrificed for it
5939314 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5939315 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5939316 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement

5939323 i am going to print it out and frame it
5939324 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5939325 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation
5939326 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need
5939327 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5939328 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5939329 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5939330 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5939331 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5939332 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5939333 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5939334 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5939335 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5939336 for him to come out and play like that i hope hes nervous as hell friday

5939339 this just means we did what we set out to do

5939375 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5939376 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5939377 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5939378 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5939379 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5939380 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5939381 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism

5939397 the credentials of christopher mtikila as a spiritual leader have been called to question by revelation that his full salvation churchs registration expired more than 17 years ago for his failure to pay annual fees
5939398 the full salvation church was registered here and obtained registration number so 6253 in 1984 but has been dormant for failing to pay annual fees and submission of progressive reports its file is now stored in the archives
5939399 let me put this clear full salvation church is not a member of pentecostal churches of tanzania pct differed with it on various aspects and decided to part with it peacefully
5939400 our church is threatened by the state agents who intimidate its leaders that is why we are so few people fear to join us
5939401 i dont remember seeing him for the last two years
5939402 it is quite difficult to engage in religious leadership and at the same time develop an ambition to become an active politician rev mtikila failed to distinguish between the two

5939412 7 intellectual property rights ipr and enforcement 7 1 the committee welcomes the emphasis in the communication i e the commissions global europe communication of october 2006 on strengthening ipr provisions in the ways that are outlined including in particular offering support to smes and others trading with the emerging economies developing the eus strategy for protecting intellectual property rights and strengthening enforcement activity is essential if the eu is to meet its aim to reduce ipr violations and the production and export of fake goods enforcement is key here the trips agreement must be fully implemented by fta free trade agreement partners thus a primary objective for the eu in concluding these ftas should be to obtain solid commitments for concrete enforcement of existing ipr legislation together with sufficient control and measurement of results achieved rather than aim for entirely new agreements europes research and development capacity and capabilities so rightly emphasised in the lisbon strategy will be a significant factor in maintaining eu competitiveness in a world where strong economic challenge will increasingly come from outside europe the ipkat wonders this paragraph seems to have all the right words in it but does it actually say anything 7 2 in combating counterfeiting the committee urges the negotiators especially with india to discuss measures to protect consumers from the risks associated with counterfeiting follow up to the agreement should include a joint eu india committee on counterfeiting as is the case with china 7 3 given that india is involved in the heiligendamm process launched in june 2007 between the g8 and the five emerging countries to create a structured dialogue on promoting innovation and protecting intellectual property rights for civil society it would be helpful for the bilateral negotiations to take account of the monitoring of this process
5939413 we acknowledged that the intention of the ad was to portray a real life situation in a humorous way but considered that the ad nonetheless showed a health care professional ignoring a woman giving birth in order to play bingo online

5939419 im so thankful that many baseball betting industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
5939420 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
5939421 im really impressed by the presentation chhour brevik did about up and coming baseball betting businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative
5939422 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
5939423 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
5939424 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
5939425 im thrilled to report record growth in the baseball betting sector
5939426 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
5939427 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the baseball betting market works and with patience you can walk with big money
5939428 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the baseball betting field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
5939429 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the baseball betting field quickly
5939430 i always tell my baseball betting clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
5939431 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
5939432 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
5939433 its better to look through the mid range baseball betting companies for ones with strong growth potential
5939434 well bitch does already have a proper and inoffensive meaning
5939435 its really a big opportunity for us and a big break for early applications of stem cells
5939436 weve been raising small amounts of money and working on larger deals
5939437 heres the challenge you would have to make the test tube production of red blood cells economically competitive with a huge ingrained industry of blood transfusions
5939438 i think the safety issues are significant but surmountable my main concern is the economic issues

5939450 just the mention is flattering and im honored but there are a lot of guys with big numbers and big names out there just the fact that they even think of me i think i won it already
5939451 we try to put combinations of lineups together that we get contributions from 1 8 or 1 9
5939452 youve got soriano in the leadoff spot you want some strength at the tail end of your lineup so hell get some rbi chances out of the 1 hole weve been relying on that all year we look to our 3 and 4 hitters more than anything else but at the same time for us to function as a team offensively we need to hit 1 8
5939453 unfortunately the thing now is only a championship will do and its really tough to do
5939454 ive been on some really good teams and ive won only one championship thats the dreaded fallback
5939455 we need to play hard stay focused not take anything for granted and take each opponent seriously thats our job
5939456 were talented we have a lot of good guys and a lot of guys that have been around
5939457 i just think were talented enough to keep our heads above water
5939458 we didnt hit a home run today but we scored 5 runs i think we have a very good team
5939459 its gotten a lot better for us on the road and hopefully we can continue it through the next month

5939480 stored colder than most beers giving it a crisp taste that appeals to women
5939481 tastes sweeter and doesnt have as strong an aroma as traditional guinness
5939482 advertising would help explain that its like a watered down guinness
5939483 it is unlikely that brewers can reverse the decline in beer sales

5939487 initial exploration of the val coal project has been encouraging
5939488 i was not nervous it was useless to chase the opponent when you did not get points from good punches
5939489 it was a pity that he lost because the fight was close
5939490 he is a fighter and still fights the same style which is not so dangerous for me but i will not take anything for granted and will fight on the outside to maximise my reach advantage
5939491 people here have felt like they were viewed as intellectually and economically disabled

5939494 she sits on the recreation ground under an oak whose yellow buds dot the pale blue sky the young grass twinkles in the wind and the sound of the wind in the knotted buds in a canopy so sitting under the knotted canopy of the wind she is lifted and carried away as in a balloon across the insensible void till she stoops to see the sandy desert beneath her the dreary platoon she knows the waste all dry beneath her in one place stirring with earth coloured life ever turning and stirring but never the motion has a human face nor sound save intermittent machinery whirring and so again on the recreation ground she alights a stranger wondering unused to the scene suffering at sight of the children playing around hurt at the chalk coloured tulips and the evening green

5939505 the war was authorized before i arrived in congress i have always voted to fund the troops just as both mccain and obama did bennett opposes funding our troops who are in harms way just to please dailykos and moveon
5939506 time horizons should be negotiated as part of sofa they should be flexible and conditions based it is a good sign that the iraqis are confident enough about the security and political situation to engage in this important discussion
5939507 if he tries to enter thailand we can arrest him detain him and deport him
5939508 but he has said he will not go to london
5939509 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5939510 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5939511 its not a done deal that he can go wherever he likes given his record
5939512 i would hope that the authorities would make sure that he does not slip off to another country
5939513 last week siobhan bennett had an opportunity for an open fair discussion of issues with congressman dent and she refused to attend now she continues to play partisan games and avoid a real conversation in front of the people of the 15th district
5939514 today she misleadingly tried to disguise a partisan political event held this evening as an independent candidates forum
5939515 even so in the interim we learned from the newspaper that the events sponsor was created in 2004 by americans for democratic action a self described
5939516 siobhan bennetts challenge for congressman dent to attend this event is another attempt to deceive the public by her campaign shes not serious about having a fair debate on the issues because shes on the wrong side of those issues further shes already lamely ducked out of the first candidate forum debate of this campaign
5939517 no ones good at getting fortunes ben its just dumb luck

5939523 in many ways carers become prisoners in their own homes
5939524 its not uncommon to come across parents whose child was 50 and had never spent a day away in all their lives
5939525 nothings changed in the health of our sons yet we still have to fill in the same forms
5939526 its a sadness that our sons are disabled and then its an anger that weve got fill them in again and again
5939527 there needs to be more recognition of the value these carers have
5939528 for carers not to be truly understood and valued is an issue the government takes a long hard look at
5939529 families must be encouraged and supported rather than ignored considered troublesome or deliberately excluded
5939530 agencies that arent paying competitive wage increases are losing staff to agencies which are near the top of the pay pile
5939531 that has a compound effect on the cost for the losing agency
5939532 so if youre on the bottom of the pay pile because you dont have funding sufficient to meet wage increases and youre churning staff your resources are continually being dragged into paying your advertising and recruitment costs
5939533 it just puts you further and further behind the eight ball
5939534 i guarantee that if you put a group of centrelink workers into an office perhaps here in canberra for a day or two they could come up with pages and pages of ways that greater efficiencies could be made which didnt have the deleterious effects that we believe the current funding arrangements have
5939535 we should not be rewarding that altruism that ethic by pushing them to the bottom of the pay pile
5939536 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information
5939537 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5939538 you could put it on a turntable and figure it out
5939539 they immediately encountered extreme fire and heat conditions and they turned back and launched an external attack
5939540 i believe you will see a significant drawdown of our troops based on conditions on the ground and that is a good thing
5939541 remember if the state of iraq fails the people who are negotiating this agreement will be the first ones who will be lined up against a wall and shot and they know that
5939542 the problem with congress on iraq is weve always talked about congressionally legislated timelines if we had adopted the timelines that
5939543 the problem in congress is that the debate has always been very narrow weve been debating very narrow aspects pro surge or anti surge timelines mandatory rest periods by the way if we had done what bennett wanted to do on the rest period she would have in effect extended the deployment of troops currently serving in iraq and treated people serving in iraq differently than people serving in afghanistan thats what she wanted to do she would have extended their deployments because if you couldnt move people in you wouldnt be able to move people out she would have extended them
5939544 yes that is correct if we had done it the way bennett wanted to do it your daughter would be staying there longer she would have had a much longer deployment than she would have liked
5939545 the goal is to go to one year rest for one year deployment but the way she proposed it
5939546 it would have been inequitable and it would have extended deployment of our men and women serving in iraq it would have been a fiasco
5939547 by the way i was one of the guys there were a handful of us on both sides of the aisle who always when these iraq votes came up said we have this bi partisan document the bush administration wasnt thrilled about it speaker pelosi didnt like it speaker pelosi refused to allow it to be considered i went to the rules committee on two separate occasions trying to present this to the whole house for a vote they said no i think that was in february of 2007 i went back again three months later i think it was in the summer of 2007 and they told me i should have brought it up months ago i said well i did but you said no then remember they said no
5939548 but that s the way i tried to work sestak was there
5939549 he was there he sat in the rules meeting with me
5939550 and joe sestak who served in the clinton administration said it took six months to move 10 000 people out of somalia you cant move 160 000 people out of iraq in six months its just impossible
5939551 thats the problem with siobhan bennetts timelines they would have legislated defeat would have led to enormous safety problems for our troops many of whom would have died in that kind of ignominious retreat thats really what she would have prescribed i think thats the reality
5939552 ive always voted to fund our troops i believe senator mccain always has and senator obama has on most occasions theres one occasion when he did not but siobham does not support funding our troops she has been in opposition to any funds going to our troops who are in harms way
5939553 all she ever wanted to do is establish operational controls on our troops
5939554 its one of the challenges and this gets back to the russia georgia issue i am very concerned about nato i believe in nato but nato is not a club it is a collective defense organization if this collective defense organization fails well all be the worse for it so we have to be very careful when we talk about admitting new nations into nato whether it be georgia and that obligates us to their
5939555 we have to have a very sober conversation about what membership means
5939556 last night i wrote up my feelings about iraq you can have this if you want
5939557 if it was a trap and theres good reason to think it was he walked right into it
5939558 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
5939559 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
5939560 the shit that happened to my children im going to get each and everyone of youse f ers back
5939561 my children are having nightmares and each and every person is going to suffer the same shit
5939562 if i see you come near my house again im going to f ing shoot you
5939563 im not going to be taken lightly you know who this is
5939564 the cover tenders were requested from the fire brigades its a bodgy price to make up the numbers
5939565 so youre telling me the fire brigade is telling you to create as you put it in your words bodgy tenders
5939566 yes thats what my understanding of what a cover price is
5939567 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5939568 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
5939569 i dont think that should be something thats necessarily considered a crisis
5939570 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing it would guarantee the bonds
5939571 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
5939572 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
5939573 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
5939574 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
5939575 it was really scary hearing the eerie screams as they made their way back to the village
5939576 the chat rooms let me know what to look up where to go
5939577 in real life traders typically congregate and become better traders by sharing knowledge if you put them online theyll chat as well
5939578 these are four distinct trends that can drive a business like ours
5939579 it is foolish not to provide those services the alternative is nursing home or residential care which is exceedingly expensive compared to home care
5939580 dont you think we ought to start having a dialogue and finding answers to this
5939581 i think our elders our parents our teachers the people that went before us deserve better than this im angry at the attitude and the lack of any concern
5939582 whats the point in releasing 200 prisoners when israel is continuing to build in the settlements although its a positive step i dont see how its going to bring us closer to peace
5939583 israel is today releasing 200 prisoners to make room in its prisons for the hundreds of palestinians who were arrested by the israeli army in the past few weeks
5939584 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
5939585 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5939586 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5939587 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5939588 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5939589 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5939590 con esta declaraci n de emergencia se ha incentivado a que la gente de cenepa del r o santiago nativos que poco conocen el mundo occidental vengan a muyo y corral quemado a reforzar m s la movilizaci n ellos lo han tomado como una provocaci n
5939591 estamos solicitando un di logo pero el estado no lo quiere ellos han promulgado estas leyes que han metido en l os a los ind genas y a pesar de eso no quiere reconocer su error y sentarse a conversar
5939592 para de una vez levantar esta movilizaci n mientras no se realice eso los ind genas se alan que no van a levantar el paro
5939593 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
5939594 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
5939595 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
5939596 those two guys have kicked a lot of goals each they are the real two key focal points for them
5939597 we have got young defenders that will have those big challenges
5939598 its looking at what eric mackenzie and beau wilkes have shown over the last few weeks and theyve taken up some big challenges and performed very well
5939599 its a pretty bad cork and its right in his buttock running into his hamstring and his hamstring was sore anyway so its sort of linked to that
5939600 in the last game he played he complained of a sore hamstring and then got the cork so its a bit of both
5939601 jangan jangan kau menolak cintaku jangan jangan kau ragukan hatiku
5939602 we took evidence from nick gruen we took evidence from the productivity commission we sought information widely and we came up with a set of recommendations that we believe is appropriate for the industry and also for the australian economy more broadly

5939607 they had this romantic notion they wanted tyler to remain in the spot where they had gone to school
5939608 if they hadnt been back in 20 years they werent seeing how it was today
5939609 tyler is about creativity and pushing contemporary boundaries and to have anything other than a contemporary building is odd

5939724 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5939725 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5939726 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5939727 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5939728 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5939729 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5939730 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5939731 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5939732 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5939733 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5939734 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5939735 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5939736 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
5939737 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong

5939741 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together

5939758 we are pleased to see that two thirds of sbc churches are offering some level of medical coverage for their ministers and families
5939759 what is most rewarding is recognizing the number of smaller churches that understand that this is an important benefit for the overall financial well being of their ministers
5939760 average worship attendance accounts for the most variance in pastor salaries 54 percent
5939761 the membership of the congregation is the next most significant factor accounting for 50 percent of salary variance church budget also explains a noticeable amount of variation 35 percent
5939762 its no surprise that pastors who have the additional responsibility of leading a larger church are paid more but it is surprising how seldom churches reward experience
5939763 compared to a pastor serving in the south a full time senior pastor in the midwest on average receives 2 124 fewer dollars of total compensation a pastor in the northeast receives 6 978 more and a pastor in the west receives 3 795 more
5939764 a full time senior pastor who does not have a seminary degree on average receives 3 660 fewer dollars in total compensation than a pastor with a seminary degree
5939765 a pastor who has a doctoral degree on average receives 10 015 more than a pastor with a high school education
5939766 the sbc church compensation study is an important resource for churches to use as they seek to determine appropriate salaries for their staff members
5939767 our prayer is that churches will use it both as they seek to hire new staff but also as they retain existing staff to ensure their compensation is competitive with other churches and within their communities

5939778 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5939779 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
5939780 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting
5939781 the reports cite unnamed india officials as saying they are hesitant to do so that is not surprising since indias participation in the discussion could force its officials to answer some uncomfortable but essential questions about its bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with the us france and russia as well as its interpretation of the india iaea safeguards agreement and other issues
5939782 also with respect to the safeguards agreement approved by the iaea on august 1 does india formally recognise that it may not unilaterally terminate the agreement or withdraw facilities or materials from safeguards even if fuel supplies are interrupted due to new delhi resuming testing or violating its safeguards agreement
5939783 has india initiated formal negotiations with the iaea regarding an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement or not

5939821 i see no changes wake up in the morning and i ask myself is life worth living should i blast myself
5939822 there is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide
5939823 i do not think that life will change for the better without an assault on the establishment the power structure based on the economic infrastructure propped up and reinforced by the media and all the secondary educational and cultural institutions which goes on exploiting the wretched of the earth this belief lies at the heart of the concept of revolutionary suicide thus it is better to oppose forces that would drive me to self murder than to endure them although i risk the likelihood of death there is at least the possibility if not the probability of changing intolerable conditions this possibility is important because much in human existence is based upon hope without any real understanding of the odds indeed we are all black and white alike ill in the same way mortally ill but before we die how shall we live i say with hope and dignity and if premature death is the result that death has a meaning reactionary suicide can never have it is the price of self respect revolutionary suicide does not mean that i and my comrades have a death wish it means just the opposite we have such a strong desire to live with hope and human dignity that existence without them is impossible when reactionary forces crush us we must move against these forces even at the risk of death

5939826 the treasury department reports that the federal budget deficit jumped in july fueled by spending on bank bail outs and the ill considered tax rebate
5939827 the deficit is going to run about 400 billion this year and at least a half trillion dollars next year this red ink will further inflate a national debt that already exceeds 9 5 trillion its time for fiscal leadership in washington
5939828 first we must cut federal spending new york mayor mike bloomberg wants a new new deal while the congress continues to spend more on virtually everything
5939829 but we can no longer afford to maintain nonessential and ineffective programs unfortunately the federal buildings which fill washington are themselves filled with unnecessary and counterproductive outlays and activities
5939830 democratic congressional leaders are talking about enacting another tax rebate but the american people are too smart to be fooled by more cheap political stunts they deserve significant and permanent tax rate reductions they also deserve a tax system that is simple and fair no more economic have real tax reform to promote the sort of economic growth necessary to put americans to work again

5939838 i think it would be nice to play brazil and want to reclaim what you wanted to have
5939839 we were all kind of shocked by the press conference for sure
5939840 just because we dont have one star doesnt mean we arent a good team we went back and told everyone on the team it definitely fired me up
5939841 if we can get in cubas head a little bit they can break down like any other team
5939842 swift boating of mormonism that advocates the religious intolerance its supposedly condemning
5939843 certain to fan the flames of hatred toward americas largest homegrown religion and continue the persecution that terrified the original mormons
5939844 equates the institution of the mormon church with islamic extremism at every opportunity
5939845 goes way beyond history into the realm of speculation rumor myth and gossip
5939846 unmistakable air of evil about this enterprise and not just an atrocity the mormon church caused to happen 150 years ago
5939847 theocratic elements that come unnervingly close to the spirit of mormon bashing
5939848 a pulse pounding movie experience reminding us that a terrorist act can happen anywhere anytime by anyone
5939849 is a zealot who behaves logically within his own belief system
5939850 a theology that sees non mormons as wicked and degenerate
5939851 when bishop samuelson says things like may these children of satan go to hell or we have been honored above all others to be the chosen instrument of death
5939852 i found the film to be artistically pleasing theatrically well done and based on my less than exhaustive research historically correct while the mormon hierarchy denies any effort to directly or indirectly sabotage the film it seems possible much of the criticism dealing with the film is derived from some common blueprint i hope that this notion is mistaken and that there is no effort on the part of the mormon establishment to do this film in if there is such an effort i have to believe it emanates from certain individuals who are acting on their own who have so little faith in the power of their religion that they think a mere film about one isolated historic incident could do it harm
5939853 paid christ the compliment of taking him and his message seriously and they have made a film that does not turn him into a garish emasculated image from a religious postcard
5939854 paul schraders screenplay and willem dafoes performance made perhaps the most honestly christlike portrayal of jesus ever filmed
5939855 i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
5939856 seventy six million americans including olympic athletes suffer from constant long standing muscle pain for which treatment is elusive
5939857 this study demonstrates a ground breaking non invasive and drug free approach that controls and may ultimately eliminate the most common cause of muscle pain
5939858 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5939859 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
5939860 were big believers in egs and were looking for more opportunities
5939861 bukankah masih ada bintang yang bersinar di langit malam ini

5939863 we are very aware of the history of mormons as a group that was chastised in america
5939864 they can be a good model for any group that feels alienated
5939865 a mormon living in an islamic society would be very comfortable
5939866 when i go to a mormon church i feel at ease
5939867 when i heard the president of lds speak a few years ago if id closed my eyes id have thought he was an imam
5939868 it shows they have a keen interest in the muslim world
5939869 the two faiths have become associated in several ways including mormonisms being called the islam of america
5939870 we both come from traditions where there has been persecution in the past and continues to be prejudice
5939871 tend to make fairly stringent demands for religious conformity on their members
5939872 have been stung in recent years by the recurrence of scandals over which they have no control
5939873 clearly the koran was joseph smiths model so closely followed as to exclude even the poor pretension of originality in his foul revelations
5939874 i met with the president of lds and the governor of utah we were sitting in the front row of the tabernacle mormons would give their right arms to be there
5939875 he was concerned and wanted to send us a very clear message that we were in their prayers
5939876 it was like having someone who loves and cares for you not so much a mormon reaching out to me as a fellow believer reaching out
5939877 hes a good man whos doing good work we try to be friendly to all people and in the days after 9 11 lots of muslims felt rejected
5939878 they have modest dress and so do we they believe in all the old testament prophets as do we

5939883 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5939884 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one

5939892 renato struggled with dalhasussers block and that made him change his strategy and make a lot of mistakes it was a bad performance
5939893 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
5939894 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
5939895 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
5939896 dont point that beard at me it might go off
5939897 you cannot grow a beard in a moment of passion
5939898 wisdom is in the head and not in the beard
5939899 he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man
5939900 there was an old man with a beard who said
5939901 kissing a man with a beard is a lot like going to a picnic you dont mind going through a little bush to get there
5939902 for me the great problem growing up in england was that i had a very narrow concept of what god can be and it was damn close to an old man with a beard
5939903 we were lead to believe they had been gearing up their english skills and they would widely be speaking it
5939904 youre likely to run into a million of them before you find the five million who do speak some english

5939911 citizen surveys conducted by the town of barnstable over the last several years have consistently identified route 28 as the worst traffic corridor in the town
5939912 we reviewed the towns peer review traffic study of the applicants traffic mitigation proposal in the amount of 150 000 and it appears to inadequately address the anticipated impacts of this retail use

5939927 debido a que la cifra solicitada por cemex es muy alta
5939928 para demostrarle al prefecto mario coss o y sus seguidores que la gente est cansada de la manipulaci n pol tica de los paros
5939929 fue un paro que se cumpli en cinco ciudades no en cinco regiones a fuerza de amedrentamiento de grupos de choque
5939930 nosotros no somos violentos ni somos golpistas siempre hemos estado contra las dictaduras militares
5939931 este es s lo un precalentamiento para el partido final
5939932 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5939933 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5939934 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5939935 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5939936 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5939937 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5939938 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5939939 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5939940 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5939941 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ
5939942 yo hab a dicho que con este grupo con estos 18 jugadores me animo a cualquier cosa pasamos por arriba a un equipo como brasil
5939943 fue nuestro mejor mejor partido de las olimp adas sic el resultado fue justo
5939944 sab amos c mo iba a jugar brasil nos iba a esperar y ten amos que tener paciencia despu s se abri el partido y argentina tuvo un gran partido en todos los sectores de la cancha

5939952 a nova resolu o que suspendeu a antiga diz que cabe comiss o parit ria paresentar uma nova proposta no dia seguinte n s fizemos isso mantendo a elei o para o dia 27
5939953 em rela o a essas datas eu n o gostaria de opinar a esse respeito como candidato mas posso falar como conselheiro do coun o que o coun decidiu em sua ltima reuni o foi que o processo retornasse s entidades para que novas propostas fossem apresentadas e novas regras estipuladas para o conselho isso aconteceria no dia 28 essa data de dia 27 esta sendo utilizada pelas entidades no meu modo de entender isso vai contra o que foi decidido na ultima reuni o
5939954 as entidades resolveram aproveitar o processo para eleger o vice respeitando o atual mandato da atual vice a que teve esse problema entre coun e entidades mas o coun n o tem decreto nenhum falando de elei es em setembro
5939955 mas a inten o realizar a elei o no dia 27 mesmo estamos trabalhando para isso as urnas j est o conosco e as listagens de professores servidores e estudantes j est o prontas

5939964 more and more people have decided that taking public transportation is the quickest way to beat the high gas prices
5939965 progressives routinely and rightly stand up for and preach respect for the beliefs of religious minorities but if they do it while sneering and scoffing at the religious beliefs of the majority they arent fooling anyone making fun of a belief in a white bearded magician in the sky is implicitly making fun of a belief in allah krishna and the great spirit and believers of all kinds know it dismissing mainstream religious beliefs as mere superstition and bigotry while standing up for the people who believe that rocks have magical healing powers and getting totally whacked out on mushrooms is the path to enlightenment expresses a cognitive dissonance that will strike most intelligent observers as indistinguishable from willfull stupidity or hypocrisy

5939990 nation a few months back john mccain was asked whether he used a pc or a mac he said something shocking on screen mccain saying he relies on wife cindy for help with the computer which confirms a long standing rumor that cindy mccain is half computer now a lot of people have said a guy who cant use a computer is the wrong person for the white house last time i checked the president only needs to know how to press one button
5939991 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets congressional quarterly reported this week that john mccain may have copied some facts in a recent speech on the georgian crisis from wikipedia i think it should have been obvious when he referred to the countrys leader as president 404 error file not found
5939992 heres just one of the examples listed in the article listen to what john mccain said about georgia on screen mccain making a speech and using sentences that sound exactly like a wikipedia entry on georgia now heres what wikipedias entry says on georgia one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion of course mccain said countries wikipedia said nations but those words are interchangeable just like sunnis and shiites
5939993 now i think mccain getting his facts from wikipedia is great news wikipedia gets its facts from the american people which means mccain is now using the peoples voice or at least lip synching to it plus the internet can be a creepy place but its a lot less creepy than mccains previous source of foreign policy information joe lieberman on screen an archived speech by mccain in which lieberman corrects him on iran ironically lieberman often needs similar help when he gets confused about the difference between republicans and democrats
5939994 a republican politician form idaho has endorsed barack obama the last time a republican switched sides was in an airport mens room
5939995 john mccain has been accused of stealing policy ideas from wikipedia which is ridiculous everybody knows mccain doesnt know how to use the internet so how could you even accuse him of that
5939996 barack obama said today he wouldnt raise taxes on anyone over 70 and mccain said obama was just pandering to the youth vote
5939997 the presidential race has been rocked by the news that two years ago john edwards had an extramarital affair with campaign worker rielle hunter who apparently caused a spike in his polling hunter produced campaign webisodes about edwards a bold idea in 2006 youtube was brand new and edwards lit up cyberspace under the pseudonym lonelyboy15 but theres an even bigger scandal to this story on screen people questioning why the mainstream media ignored the john edwards story for so long when the national enquirer picked up on it in october 2007 exactly this was reported in the national enquirer last october why is the mainstream media ignoring the national enquirer i mean look at the latest issue right here on screen colbert holds up the latest cover of the national enquirer showing stories on plastic surgery shockers why isnt the new york times reporting on what happened to madonnas face oh oh girlfriend no no no why didnt cnn pick up on this story on page five about eva longoria gaining weight in her attempts to get pregnant by the way confidential to miss longoria if youre trying to get pregnant i recommend making webisodes for john edwards
